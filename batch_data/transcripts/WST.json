In addition, during today\u2019s call management may make reference to non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in materials accompanying this morning\u2019s earnings release.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Don Morel, West\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Don? Don Morel : Thank you, John, good morning everyone and welcome to West\u2019s Q1 2014 Earnings Call. This morning Bill and I will review our results and discuss our outlook and financial guidance for the remainder of the year. We will again refer to a slide deck to support our prepared remarks that can be accessed through our website at www.westpharma.com under Investors. In the event you cannot access the presentation our commentary will cover the information both in this morning\u2019s release and the slides. Beginning with Slide 3 which summarizes our Q1 performance, a modest increase in sales coupled with a less-than-favorable mix in the Packaging Systems segment produced a softer start to the year than we would normally see. As we discussed in our February call this was not completely unexpected and we do not believe it reflects any fundamental change in the underlying drivers of our business. On a consolidated basis sales rose 1.2% to $346.8 million excluding the effects of currency. Revenues were effectively flat in the Packaging Systems segment while sales increased 5.6% in the Delivery Systems segment driven primarily by demand for contract manufacturing services. The less than favorable mix produced a decline in our gross margin, leading to earnings of $0.38 per fully diluted share versus $0.44 in Q1 2013 which was a record year in all respects. Highlights for the operating segments are shown on Slide 4. For the quarter, Packaging Systems sales of high-value products declined by a little over 6%, primarily as a result of reduced orders for Teflon and FluroTec enclosures. This was built into our full year operating plan given the substantial growth these product lines experienced throughout 2013. Our analysis of current order flows and the rapid increase in our Packaging Systems backlog through March gives us confidence that this issue is largely behind us. In the Delivery Systems segment slight declines in sales of proprietary products like Safety, Reconstitution and CZ were more than offset by continued strength in the contract manufacturing business. CZ sales for the period were $3 million comprised mostly of vial and cartridge sales. Sales of the 1ml long Insert needle syringe were modest and are expected to be sporadic throughout the year depending on customer pre-commercial use for testing and validation requirements. Despite the relatively slow start to the year we see no fundamental changes to the primary growth drivers of our business over the long term. For the next three quarters we expect our order book to steadily improve, leading to a strong finish for the year. Indeed as I mentioned earlier, our backlog strengthened substantially at the end of Q1, increasing 11% versus year-end levels. More importantly the composition of the backlog indicates that orders for high-value products are returning to historical patterns and we should see high-single to low-double digit growth through the end of the year. Slide 5 provides highlights for ongoing expansion and development programs. Our new China elastomer plant is now operational and has started commercial sales. Work on the India seals plant has been completed and we have received our operating license for the local government authorities. On the development program front we continue to work closely with a number of customers to develop custom device solutions based on a broad array of West technologies including SmartDose and CZ.  As noted in our release this morning, pursuant to a development and supply agreement we are collaborating with Amgen on automated mini-dose systems utilizing West\u2019s SmartDose Technology. Due to the confidential nature of our work with Amgen we will not be providing any further commentary other than what is in today\u2019s release. The 1 ml Insert needle syringe program is at a stage where orders will continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as our lead customers have completed much of their qualification work. For those customers with formulations undergoing formal stability testing we continue to believe the lead candidates for commercialization will finish testing in the late 2015 or early 2016 timeframe.  Once this testing is complete the data can then be submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies depending on the market where approval is being sought. On a positive note, the demand for CZ cartridges to support SmartDose testing and CZ vials for aggressive drugs continues to be healthy and in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 6 we are confirming our guidance for the full year and believe sales growth will be in the range of 6% to 8% on a consolidated basis, yielding revenues between $1.45 billion and $1.48 billion. We are forecasting an improving mix through the end of the year driven by high-value product growth which should translate into stronger consolidated gross and operating margins yielding full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.77 to $1.89 at our assumed current exchange rates. Our confidence in delivering solid sales and earnings growth for the full year is based on the positive changes in order flows at the end of the quarter, the composition of our backlog and the absence of any fundamental change in our underlying business drivers [or] market share. Our strategy remains focused on expansion of our high-value product offerings, lean operations and selective organic growth in emerging markets for the Packaging segment; while shifting sales in the proprietary products group to a higher percentage of our overall sales for the DS division. We believe proprietary products as a percent of overall sales will continue to grow through 2014. On a final note I\u2019d also like to extend an invitation to attend our 2014 Investor Day on the morning of May 22nd which will be held at the Cornell Club in New York City. Details will be posted on our website in the next few days, however, for those who cannot attend the presentation will also be webcast. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bill Federici for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. We issued our Q1 results this morning, reporting net income of $27.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share versus the $0.45 per diluted share we reported in Q1 2013. As explained in the release, excluding the effect of one-time items from the prior-year quarter our Q1 2013 earnings were $0.44 per adjusted diluted share. A reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures is provided on Slides 13 and 14. Turning to sales, Slide 7 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Consolidated Q1 sales were $346.8 million, an increase of 1.2% over Q1 2013 sales excluding exchange. Packaging Systems sales were essentially flat versus the same quarter 2013 sales excluding exchange.  Sales price increases in Packaging Systems were limited to approximately 0.4 percentage points and were offset by an unfavorable mix of products sold with our high-value products declining 6.9% versus the prior year Q1. The decline in high-value products sales was not unexpected and we believe should be considered in the context of the double-digit growth experienced in each of the two last year comparable quarters benefiting from customer inventory builds. Importantly, for the remainder of 2014 we expect an 8% to 12% growth in high-value products sales versus the comparable year period. Our current packaging systems backlog growth of 11% over the prior year is mostly due to an increase in committed high-value product orders. In short, we do not believe our Q1 results represent any change in the long-term growth trajectory for our business. Delivery Systems sales increased by 5.6% or $4.9 million over sales in the prior-year quarter excluding exchange. Crystal Zenith product sales were $3 million in the current quarter, approximately $600,000 below Q1 2013 levels and were predominantly comprised of vial and cartridge samples. Overall sales of proprietary products were $21.0 million or 22.5% of the segment\u2019s revenues in the quarter versus 25.0% in the prior-year quarter. As provided on Slide 8 our consolidated gross profit margin for Q1 2014 was 30.7% versus the 32.9% margin we achieved in Q1 2013. Packaging Systems Q1 gross margin of 35.4% was 2.3 margin points lower than the 37.7% achieved in Q1 2013. The decline in the gross margin is due to the unfavorable mix from the lower HVP sales and lower plant utilization coupled with normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead costs, and the relative low price increases. Delivery Systems Q1 gross margin declined by one margin point to 18.1% compared to the prior year quarter. The current quarter\u2019s lower gross margin is primarily due to the decline in proprietary device sales and normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead costs.  As reflected on Slide 9, Q1 2014 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $2.7 million versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, Q1 2014 SG&A expense was 16.2% versus 17.4% in Q1 2013. Pension costs declined by $1.9 million, benefiting from the strong return on plant assets in 2013.  Stock-based compensation and incentive costs were $1.3 million lower than a year ago primarily as a result of the decrease in our stock price during Q1 2014. Other compensation costs were $2.3 million higher including annual salary increases and increased staffing. Outside service costs were lower than the prior-year quarter. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $8.8 million for the quarter, $10.0 million less than the prior year quarter reflecting the decline in our results and higher working capital requirements. Our capital spending was $31.7 million in the current quarter. We expect to spend approximately $125 million to $145 million in capital in 2014. Approximately half of the planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion activities, including approximately $13 million for the construction of Packaging Systems facilities in China and India. Slide 11 provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we\u2019re confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at March 31st was $230 million, equal to our December \u201913 balance. A large majority of our cash is invested overseas and is generally not available to be repatriated to the US without incurring tax consequences. Debt at March 31st was $404 million, $31.4 million higher than at year end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter end was 15.8%. Working capital totaled $459 million at March 31st, $45 million higher than at year end. The majority of the increase is due to higher inventory and accounts receivables balances. Our backlog of committed Packaging Systems orders stands at $351 million at March, 2014, 11% higher than at year end excluding exchange \u2013 but as expected about 5% lower than the March 2013 backlog which we attribute to our shorter lead times. At March 2014 high-value products represent 53% of the total backlog versus 49% of the December \u201913 backlog. Based on our Q1 2014 results and our analysis of the orders on hand we have narrowed our full-year 2014 earnings guidance in this morning\u2019s release. That guidance is summarized on Slide 12. We have based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.37 per Euro. By contrast, our previous guidance was translated at a $1.35 per Euro rate. As a reminder, each $0.01 weakening of the dollar versus the Euro results in an approximately $0.01 increase in full-year forecasted EPS as a result of translation. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Don Morel. Don? Don Morel : Thank you very much, Bill. This concludes our commentary for this morning and we\u2019d now be pleased to answer any questions. Operator? Operator : (Operator instructions.) The first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.\\ Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Good morning. Focusing first on your backlog, your lead times had been running extraordinarily high \u2013 22 to 24 weeks. You brought it down to around twelve weeks in Q4; is that about where we are now? Don Morel : Yes. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Okay. In Q4 you had mentioned two additional development agreements I believe for SmartDose. Is there any update you can provide on that? Don Morel : The work is ongoing and we are producing samples for those clients. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Okay. And then you also referred to some deferred projects that would add to contract manufacturing revenue. You can have some fairly sizable swings in margin depending on what these products are. Can you expand any more on the deferred projects and when you expect the revenue from that to hit? Don Morel : The first project is online as we speak; we are doing validation and trial runs on the tooling. The second one will come into operation later in the year. We expect the first to contribute a good amount during the year; the second one a bit more modestly. So both of those should be up and running by Q3 or Q4. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Okay, and I do have one final question if I can. In your prepared remarks regarding guidance you talk about $10 million to $20 million in the course of the year in growth in sales and development income associated with proprietary products. Is there any change in that? I know the numbers are the same. Is there any message or change you\u2019re trying to convey with that at this point? Don Morel : No, it\u2019s actually comprised of a combination of paid development agreements, private (inaudible) plus revenues from proprietary products. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Okay. Thank you very much. Don Morel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rafael Tejada of Bank of America. Rafael Tejada \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Thank you for the questions. So just getting back to the backlog question again, I want to make sure I heard you right. You said backlog was up 11% year-over-year so that\u2019s about $416 million, $415 million or so? Don Morel : Yeah, that number is up from 1st of the year 2013. Rafael Tejada \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Alright, gotcha. Bill Federici : Our year-end number was roughly around $315 million so $351 million now. Rafael Tejada \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And so I thought it was encouraging to hear that you do have more committed orders for more high-value products. I just wanted to get a better sense of how we should think about the burn in terms of when to expect recognition for that backlog, if anything\u2019s changed in terms of how you see that backlog progressing through the quarters. Bill Federici : Yeah, primarily as you know the backlog will be revenue generally in the next quarter plus some that falls into the succeeding two quarters after that. That has, the curve of that has shortened \u2013 because of our shortened lead times customers don\u2019t need to place their orders as much in advance. So you see a lot of that come through in Q2 and Q3. Rafael Tejada \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And also just thinking about the pacing of the year, you\u2019re reaffirming the sales growth but I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail I guess in terms of how you see the sales trajectory changing, pacing through the year. And you\u2019re reaffirming your margin outlook, too, so just given what we saw in Q1 how do we see that moving through the year? Thanks. Don Morel : We clearly think that we\u2019re going to see stronger performance in Q2. Our visibility beyond that tails into Q3 a little bit, not so much in Q4. What we\u2019re hearing from our customers is that those orders are going to continue to increase throughout the year, especially the ones that we highlighted in our February call when we had inventory builds for the process change in our LeNuvion facility as well as some new product launches. So we expect steady improvement both on the sales front and the margin front through the end of the year. Certainly it\u2019s a bit unusual compared to our normal years where we\u2019d historically see the front end loaded for the first six months, but this has happened to us in the past. I think it was \u201909 or \u201910 where we had a soft first half of the year and then it strengthened\u2026 Actually it was \u201911 \u2013 it strengthened through Q4 of \u201911 and then things really started to hit robustly. Rafael Tejada \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, just a couple more. Any impact from weather this quarter and I was wondering if you could comment just on, I guess on just purchase orders from pharma, spec pharma \u2013 any changes in habits from key end customers? Don Morel : No, I mean the weather issue was a non-issue for us actually, surprisingly. The one plant we were worried about was our upstate pharma plant in Jersey Shore. Everything was in line with expectations there. On the specialty pharma front the only change that we have really seen has been the one customer that ceased operations in 2013. They were a contract manufacturer and predominantly consumed the high-value FluroTec and West\u00ae closures. So those revenues are being picked up by other customers. We\u2019re seeing slight increases in some and we\u2019ve seen the status quo in others but we haven\u2019t seen any single customer stand out.  The only ones that really have a strong delta are the ones that I spoke about previously that had to do the qualification runs because of the process change at our French plant and those that had strong inventory builds in the second half of the year. But we see those orders returning in Q2. Rafael Tejada \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And this is more of a higher-level question, Don, but one of the questions I\u2019m getting is on basically the potential impact of some of the pharma consolidation, asset changes, etc. And basically just thinking about the way in which in the past these sort of transactions have impacted the business, whether as it relates to inventory de-stocking, and so just wanted to get your perspective on what you\u2019re seeing out there \u2013 any concern in the business and I guess any actions to mitigate any sort of risks that may present? And a lot of these things are so early but I just wanted to get your thoughts. Don Morel : Yeah, I think the key point, Rafael, is what you said at the end \u2013 they are very early. Once they close and we consolidate some plans the merger plans begin to take effect. The principle effect on us tends to be a delay in development programs where decisions are pushed off until the organization is worked out and the various lines of decision making are established.  The other way that we\u2019re affected is often if there is a concentration in a particular therapeutic category the regulatory authorities may ask them to divest certain product lines. We usually see those picked up. So there can be a change in order patterns while those sales take place and the new producer picks up the product, but they tend to take place over time and they\u2019re very, very hard to predict. So qualitatively one, the ways of the development programs and the decisions made there in terms of what to fund and what to prioritize; and two, the product shifts that sometimes take place. Rafael Tejada \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Don Morel : Thanks, Rafael. Operator : Thank you for your question. (Operator instructions.) Your next question comes from Ross Taylor of CL King. Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King and Associates : I just had two or three quick questions. Just first a minor question on the backlog. For last year\u2019s March quarter can you give a percentage breakdown for the high-value products versus the more standard products, just given (inaudible)? Bill Federici : It was 53% high-value products of the total which is what it is at the end of March this year as well. At the end of December as I mentioned it was down to 49% of total. Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King and Associates : Okay. Don Morel : Ross, one comment. You have to be careful with that comparison because I would suspect the 2013 number incorporated some volume for the contract manufacturer I spoke about. So the delta is actually better on a comparative basis. Bill Federici : And we also had longer lead times in March of 2013 so if you\u2019re trying to do apples to apples those lead times have come down. So the customers don\u2019t need to place orders as much in front of when they want delivery as they had back in March of 2013. Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King and Associates : Okay, alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then I\u2019m kind of guessing that that increase in the percentage of the backlog related to the high-value products is one item that gives you a lot of confidence in that forecast you gave out of 8% to 12% growth in the high-value products over the balance of this year. Is that assumption correct? Don Morel : I think I would put it more into a family as opposed to a single product, Ross. Clearly a lot of that is FluroTec and Teflon-coated closures as well as prefilled syringe plungers. Those would be the driving categories. Bill Federici : But you\u2019re right \u2013 the fact that there is a backlog increase in that composition of the increase is largely related to high-value products. This does give us a lot of comfort that that 8% to 12% growth for the remainder of the year makes a lot of sense to us in high-value products. Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King and Associates : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my last question relates to one of the comments in your press release on SmartDose where you stated that you expect some promising early-stage work to emerge as full-scale development programs during 2014. And if something becomes a full-scale development program does that mean it\u2019s highly likely or 100% likely that it\u2019s going to go into clinical trials? Or how should we think about a \u201cfull-scale development program?\u201d Don Morel : The full-scale development to us means where we are delivering a solution to the customer for either their human use trials and/or clinical trials. When it gets to the utilization phase it usually means that we are at the start of Phase III and we have to have the lines and then we\u2019ll produce actual devices should the regulatory bodies approve the product that will be used when the product goes to market. So full-scale development applies to us delivering those devices for the human use and early clinical trials. Ross Taylor \u2013 CL King and Associates : Okay. That\u2019s great, thanks very much. Don Morel : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Hi, a couple of quick follow-ups. Normally your Q1 is your peak gross margin quarter as you get the benefit from price increases. Obviously this year\u2019s gross margin was somewhat less. Again, I just want to clarify \u2013 there\u2019s nothing other than timing and mix that would affect your gross margin outlook? Bill Federici : Yeah, the price you mentioned it on, in Packaging Systems the price increase was 0.4 percentage points. If you compare that to Q1 2013 it was 2.4 percentage points. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Okay. Don Morel : Yeah, if you were to normalize the quarter, Arnie, for the HVP sales that declined I think you\u2019d see the margins pretty much in line with where we were in prior- Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : And that plus the pricing. Bill Federici : And remember, Arnie, as we said in the release normal inflationary cost increases have affected our margin as well. And those things along with when you have less high-value products you have less throughput in the plants so your efficiency isn\u2019t as good, your absorption isn\u2019t as good. So all of those factors together caused that margin to decline by 2.2% on a consolidated basis. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : And we break out your SG&A in more detail than you do. Just to freshen that up can you comment on your IT spend and your outlook for that for the year? Bill Federici : The IT spend was down, not a lot \u2013 it was roughly the same as it was in Q1 last year. And our spend for the full year will be roughly equivalent to what it was last year. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Okay. And I have a more structural question for Don if you don\u2019t mind. There\u2019s been tremendous discussion among healthcare analysts about reimbursement and pricing on orphan drugs. I think the thing that really highlighted this was Gilead and I will mangle the pronunciation of the drug Solvadi. And the conclusion some investors seemed to reach is that healthcare companies were going to stop development of future drugs which would obviously have an enormous impact on you. Care to comment on that, Don? Don Morel : We certainly haven\u2019t seen any signs of that. I mean obviously the total course of therapy for the Hep-C drug out of Gilead kind of hit everybody between the eyes. I mean there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s expensive. But in terms of development programs we see coming in and customer inquiries on closure systems and devices for new drugs we see no change. I mean clearly the conversation is going to continue because of the ACA and reimbursement but if you\u2019re the person that needs the drug I think you\u2019re going to find a way to pay for it. So we\u2019re optimistic. The pipeline is as good as it\u2019s ever been. The composition of the trials coming through the FDA has a very high percentage of biologics as you know and that\u2019s a space where West really enjoys a comfortable technology advantage currently as well as relationships with those customers that are key. So I\u2019m optimistic. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities : Thank you very much. Don Morel : Thanks, Arnie. Operator : I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Don Morel, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Don Morel : Thank you very much, Operator, and thank you everyone for your time this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again with our Q2 results in the latter part of July or early August. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, have a good day.",

As John mentioned, the slides we will use to support our remarks can be accessed through our Web site www.westpharma.com by clicking on the Investor tab at the bottom of the homepage and selecting Presentation Materials from the menu. If some reason you cannot access the presentation, our discussion will cover the information both in this morning\u2019s release and the slides. Let me start with some high level financials for the quarter, which are summarized on Slide 3. As forecasted in our May 1st call, sales strengthened considerably during the second quarter, increasing 5.3% on a consolidated basis to just under $369 million. Our consolidated gross margin improved from 32.2% to 33%, reflecting a richer product mix in both businesses and our operating margin improved to 14.7% versus 12.3% during the second quarter of 2013. The increased sales of high-value products and Packaging Systems and higher percentage of sales from proprietary products and delivery systems coupled with disciplined spending resulted in an $11.6 million increase in operating income. Earnings for the quarter were $0.52 per fully diluted share compared to $0.43 reported in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of approximately 21%. Overall, it was a very good quarter for the Company. Slide 4 summarizes some operating highlights from the two business segments. Please note that the sales growth numbers I will refer to exclude the slightly positive effect of currency during the quarter. In the Packaging Systems segment revenues grew 4.5% compared with the second quarter in 2013, driven primarily by an 8.5% increase in the High-Value Product of HVP categories. The growth in sales was a result of demand for Daikyo products, for specially Daikyo RSV and Westar RS and RU packaging components. We also experienced nice growth in standard systems which more than offset a slight decline in disposable medical device component sale. On a geographic basis, packaging grew in most of our major markets with the Americas and Asia-Pacific contributing the most to our sales increase. In the Delivery Systems segment, sales were up 7.2% versus the prior year quarter, as continued demand for contract manufacturing services was bolstered by nice growth in several proprietary product categories, including SmartDose units for clinical trial and CZ vials and cartridges. CZ sales increased by $1 million versus the second quarter of 2013 and by $2.8 million when compared with the first quarter. A relative decline in SG&A and R&D costs combined, with a richer sales mix produced a strong improvement in diluted EPS. Turing to Slide 5, we provide an update for several of our key ongoing development programs. As previously reported, we\u2019ve completed the new elastomer facility in China and the new seal facility in India which was formerly dedicated earlier this month. Both have begun commercial operations. CZ sales for the quarters were up nicely on vial and cartridge volumes. We also booked $1 million order for the 1 ml long Insert needle syringe. The Insert needle syringe program is at a stage where orders will continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as our lead customers have completed much of their qualification work. For those customers with formulations undergoing formal stability testing using this syringe, there is no change in our expectations that the lead candidates for commercialization will finish testing in the late 2015 or early 2015 time frame. Feedback from key customers indicates that testing continues to go well and the system shows excellent compatibility with a range of complex biologics. On a positive note, we now believe the first regulatory filing for a custom CZ container will take place before the end of 2014 for a drug product currently on the market. Regulatory approval is anticipated to fall in the first half of 2015, which should lead to commercial sales sometime in the late second quarter or early third quarter of 2015. In our release, we noted that SmartDose clinical trial volumes contributed to the delivery system segment\u2019s quarterly growth. The development programs we have referenced on recent calls continue to go well. We\u2019ve showed it on Slide 6 increase in the over 10,000 units per month at the end of the quarter. We anticipate that outlook will further increase during the second half of the year to support multiple development programs that are underway. We are prohibited from discussing the particulars of those programs today due to confidentiality obligations to all of those customers.  As summarized on Slide 6, we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year. We believe sales growth will be in the range of 4% to 6% on a consolidated basis, yielding revenues between $1.43 billion and $1.46 billion. Looking at customer orders pattern early in the third quarter, we would not be surprised to see some seasonal lumpiness in sales between the third quarter and fourth quarter.  While we\u2019re confident in our full year guidance range, our quarterly visibility is not as strong as we would like, at as lead times have shortened due to additional capacity coming online within West and our customer\u2019s inventory management efforts at the end of the year coupled with traditional seasonality. In PDS we expect good growth on the small proprietary products base as a result of clinical work in SmartDose, renewed growth in reconstitution devices due to a customer\u2019s new product introduction and ongoing growth in contract manufacturing services. Based on the composition of our backlog and input from customers, we currently believe that product mix will be favorable through the end of the year, which should translate into stronger consolidated growth and operating margins yielding full year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.77 to $1.89 at our assumed current exchange rates. Our strategic goals remain unchanged, delivering value to our shareholders through expansion of our high value product offerings, lean operations and selective organic growth in emerging markets for the packaging segment while shifting our sales mix to West proprietary products in the Delivery Systems group. In our key therapeutic markets, diabetes, oncology, autoimmune disease and vaccines, we are very well positioned to grow with a number of new product launches forecasted for the next three years.  New product offerings such NovaPure closures, coupled with CZ primary containers and the SmartDose automated dosing device are the right solutions at the right time for a range of unmet market needs. As has been our past practice, our strategic plan review and updated long-term financial objectives will be completed in October and we will provide a review of our plan for the 2015 to 2019 period during our Q3 call. In sum, I think the key takeaways from today\u2019s call are as follows : a very good quarter based on high value products and proprietary product growth. Second half demand is unfolding but we expect some quarter-to-quarter lumpiness due to seasonality and customer inventory management. We\u2019ve made excellent progress on CZ and SmartDose, including the initial CZ filing which we expect to take place later this year. There are no changes to our fundamental long-term growth drivers and it includes a strong and growing pipeline of biologics within our customer base. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bill Federici for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. We issued our second quarter results this morning, reporting net income of $37.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share, versus the $0.43 per diluted share we reported in the second quarter of 2013. There were no non-GAAP adjustments either this quarter or the comparable prior year quarter. Turning to sales, Slide 7 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Consolidated second quarter sales were $368.9 million, an increase of 5.3% over second quarter 2013 sales excluding exchange. Packaging Systems sales were $268 million, 4.5% above same quarter 2013 sales excluding favorable exchange. Our mix of products sold was favorable in the quarter with High Value Products increasing 8.5% above Q2 2013 levels.  Delivery Systems sales were $101 million this quarter, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year quarter excluding exchange. Crystal Zenith product sales were $5.8 million in the current quarter, approximately $1 million above Q2 2013 levels. Much of the CZ sales were comprised of vial and cartridge samples. SmartDose sales were $2.6 million for the quarter, up nicely from the prior year quarter\u2019s sales of $400,000. Sales of proprietary products were $27.2 million or 27.1% of the segment\u2019s revenues in the quarter versus the prior year quarter\u2019s 25.6%. As provided on Slide 8, our consolidated second quarter gross profit margin of 33% was eight tenths of a margin point higher than we achieved in the second quarter of 2013. Packaging Systems second quarter gross margin of 37.8% was nine tenths of a margin point higher than we achieved in the second quarter of '13. The increased margin reflects the favorable mix of product sold and stable raw material cost. Delivery Systems second quarter gross margin of 20.3% was eight tenths of a margin point higher in Q3 \u201913 benefiting from increased plant utilization and a better mix of product sold. As reflected on Slide 9, Q2 2014 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $2.2 million versus the prior quarter. As a percentage of sales, second quarter 2014 SG&A expense was 15.6%, versus 17.3% in the second quarter of 2013. Lower retirement benefit cost, incentive compensation, and employee medical benefit cost accounted for the majority of the decrease in SG&A cost. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $73 million for the current year-to-date period, $25 million less than the comparable prior year period, mostly due to the $20 million licensing payment for SmartDose received in June 2013. Our capital spending was $56.2 million for the first half of\u201914. We expect to spend approximately $125 million to $145 million in capital in 2014. Approximately half of the planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion activities, including approximately $13 million for the new Packaging Systems facilities in China and India. Slide 11 provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we\u2019re confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at June 30th was $226.7 million, down $3.3 million from the December 2013 balance. A large majority of our cash is invested overseas and is generally not available to be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring net tax consequences. However, during this quarter we repatriated approximately $28 million of offshore cash, which we used to pay down debt and advanced fund a $3 million pension payment at June 30th. Debt at June 30th was $361.5 million, approximately $12 million lower than at year end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter end was 12.2%. Working capital totaled $464.2 million at June 30th, $50 million higher than at year end. The majority of the increase is due to higher inventory and accounts receivable balances. Our backlog of committed Packaging Systems orders stands at $314 million at June 30th, equal to year end levels but about 9% lower than the June 2013 backlog. We attribute the decrease in backlog to our success at reducing production lead times alleviating customers need to place orders earlier to assure delivery. While lower, the composition of our backlog remain strong with High Value Products representing 51% of the orders compared to 47% as of June 2013. The decrease in backlog does reduce our short-term visibility, but discussions with our customers show no loss of business and no change in longer term expectations. Based on our year-to-date 2014 results and our analysis of our orders on hand, we have confirmed our full year 2014 diluted EPS guidance in this morning\u2019s release. We have reduced our sales growth expectation for 2014 based on less near-terms visibility and continuing customer inventory management including global movements of customer products sourcing. The sales reductions are expected to be offset by a strong mix of product sold as evidenced by the strengthening high value product mix within the current backlog and continued lean savings. That guidance is summarized on Slide 12. We have based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.37 per euro, the same ratio used in prior guidance. Our Q3 results will have tough comps to the prior year quarter when a surge in high value product sales and strong price increases drove a 10.9% increase in consolidated sales and a 50% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Nonetheless, we expect modest EPS gains for Q3 versus the record 2013 quarter while Q4 comps will be less challenging. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Don Morel. Don? Don Morel : Thank you very much, Bill. This concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We look forward to answering of you questions. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) First line of question comes from the lien of Arnie Ursaner of CJS. Please proceed. Arnie Ursaner - CJS: Don, I think you want to add your weight three or four times to highlight customer order patterns, lumpiness and various other terms that lack of visibility or less visibility for Q3 and obviously you\u2019ve always had this issue. Could you explain a little bit more on what you\u2019re really seeing there and because again $314 million backlog is far from a negative number. So maybe talk a little more about what you\u2019re seeing backlog and why you are a little more uncomfortable about visibility. Don Morel : I think it\u2019s a combination of things as I outlined in my remarks; first of which is that in the third quarter as you know, we get our historic seasonality. Europe shuts down. We do a PM&A in the plants. So that certainly is part of it. We\u2019ve got the factors that of many of our med device customers actually end their fiscal year on September 30. So they are pulling back on some of their orders based on what they are seeing in the marketplace. And then we have the issue at the beginning of the year where we have these two or three one of items and we weren\u2019t certain how those patterns would unfold when that business started to come back. So as I said, we\u2019re very optimistic about the full year. We will deliver a good year. But those things combined give us a little bit less visibility and backlog than we would ordinarily have.  The other issue of course is that we brought additional capacity online whereas last year in the third quarter, when we saw this tremendous demand on the HVP side because our customers were under the impression that we had constrained capacity, we don\u2019t have that issue and lead times for those products shot in some cases to 20 to 24 weeks down into our more traditional 12 to 14 weeks. So they're getting more comfortable placing orders in that timeframe as opposed to the longer lead times. So overall, no real change from what we\u2019ve seen historically but those things that have tribute to a little less visibility than we would ordinarily have. Arnie Ursaner - CJS: My second question relates more generally to one of your customers, Amgen, an announcement they made recently about restructuring and capacity. Could you comment on how you envision that impacting a company like yours on a go forward basis? Don Morel : It\u2019s a broader question for the industry and that has to do with manufacturing footprint and capacity off of the given line. So one of the things we see anecdotally is a subtle but increasing shift away from massive clean rooms and massive infrastructure that can handle very high volume-filling requirements to shorter lower-volume runs that can be done in smaller, contained environments such as barrier isolators. Our customers have massive infrastructures. They are looking at their own production needs. I think they are also looking at what their future products are going to look like in terms of yearly demand. They would rather deal with 2 million-unit run on a system that has 2 million to 3 million unit capacity for growth then they would on a 20 million unit line, run for a couple of weeks, shutdown for a couple of months and then go through all of the requirements to start up again. So I would not be surprised as a general rule to see many of our customers begin to look at this kind of an option. For us, it doesn\u2019t really change anything because the inventories will be kept the same and our volumes won\u2019t change unless there is organic growth in any specific drug. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next line of question comes from Ross Taylor of CL King. Please proceed. Ross Taylor - CL King :  Yes, just missed a couple of your comments related to the CZ filing you expect in 2014. What was the timing you would expect for your approval of that and when could your sales maybe start to ramp up related to that product? Don Morel : Yes, I think assuming that it follows the timeline that we\u2019ve been given by the customer, approval would take place sometime early next year and we would expect commercial volumes to begin ramping up sometime in the second or third quarter based on the time of the regulatory cycle. Just to be clear, this is a custom container that is different from the syringe and it\u2019s a very unique product that is being done with a supplement for an existing product, not a new drug. Ross Taylor - CL King : And also you mentioned as part of the reason for bringing down your organic revenue growth forecast, I think you mentioned something like global changes in product sourcing. What were you referring to there exactly or maybe you could just give us some color on that? Don Morel : Yes, there is a couple of things. I\u2019ll let Bill handle the sourcing question, but just to be clear, we think it\u2019s a timing issue. So you will remember in the February call, we talked about these process changes within our plants and we expected to see those volumes begin to develop further in the year as customers worked down the inventory they'd ordered in '13. That is a happening but a little bit slower than we thought. So some of the orders that would have taken place in Q3, Q4, we believe are going to come in late Q4, but not be delivered until the early part of 2015. So I\u2019ll let Bill address the geographic answer. Bill Federici : I think Ross, what we're seeing is based on some of the difficulties that some of our customers were having regulatory wise, you saw -- especially in the generic space, you saw a lot of movement of those products sourcing around the globe. It was moving from -- in one customer\u2019s sense it moved from Europe and United States over into Asia. So there is a lot of movement, a lot of different players that are picking up the slack from the regulators slowing down the ability of some of those contract manufacturers to produce. And by having all those things, all those moving parts and different players coming in and out of the story, it makes it very difficult to track actual needs. And what we saw last year and we\u2019ve talked about it already in Q3 last year, we had a big surge in high value product orders. Some of that was due to this phenomenon where you had multiple different players going after these -- to fill the blanks left by these other customers who are having regulatory problems. So when we look at it this year and we look at the reduced backlog from the perspective of shorter lead times and some of these pieces that are moving around, it makes this less visibility issue a little tougher for us to predict exactly when it\u2019s going to come out, as Don said. We know that all of the underlying favorable trends that we\u2019ve seen in our business, especially at it relates to biologics remain unchanged. We know that we've got no loss of business from customers\u2019 perspective. It\u2019s a just function of timing and when will those orders come back into the order book. So it\u2019s just the global nature of those products and then moving around just makes it a little more complicated for us to be able identify exactly when it\u2019s going to come back. Operator : Thanks for your question. The next line of question comes from the line of Rafael Tejada. Please proceed. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just wanted to comment a bit more on the change to the top line guidance. I know that it's specific to packaging. So you mentioned, backlog contained more high value products. So can give specific examples of sort of products I guess that you\u2019re -- that are coming out of it and I would presume that it\u2019s more standard product and you\u2019ve talked about what\u2019s going on in terms of sort of the issues, what\u2019s sort of product the ones been impacted? Don Morel : Yes, there is a couple of things in there, the first one of which is, yes, it is some standard product, it is some disposable med device where we tend to see much short lead times. You may recall from the February call, we spoke specifically about Teflon-coated plungers for prefilled syringes and the two customers that has ordered larger quantities in the third quarter of last year. Those two combined make up the bulk of the shortfall and again it\u2019s a timing issue. It\u2019s a shift that\u2019s going to happen when those come back in 2015. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay that\u2019s helpful. Again just to be clear, M&A and sort of asset transfer changes that we saw earlier this year, that\u2019s not having any sort of impact on I guess the timing of order in packaging? Don Morel : Not that we can put our figure on, no. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And with regards to the CZ filing, any sort of color that you could give us on the type of drug that it is, volumes or therapeutic area for this filing? Don Morel : Not that I\u2019d be comfortable with. That\u2019s customer proprietary. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, I had to try. And my last one just one -- I guess as this filing occurs, what sort of preparation do you need to do on your end to be able to meet some of the anticipated demand? Don Morel : Yes, we actually, on this particular product, we've already started -- the primary capacity is more to go into the injection class. So, we are ready for volumes as they unfold. There'll no additional capital investment that we can see right now to meet to those volumes. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And lastly, do you think that this sort of expedites any conversations that you have with existing customers, those that are kind of brink of whether they do want to use this product or not? Don Morel : I think it\u2019s just case by case. It depends on what\u2019s driving the need. If it's a new product and a compatibility issue; it\u2019s one thing. If it's an existing product going to exist in product with the lamination of the glass as the primary driver, it\u2019s going to be another issue. The conservations have been ongoing at a high level for several years now. It\u2019s just the fact that of the matter that it\u2019s working its way through the approval process much like a new drug would and the timelines are somewhat comparable. The good news is we\u2019ve seen no reduction in levels of interest and in some cases, especially as it relates to developmental interest in SmartDose where we use the CZ cartridge, its increased interest. Operator : Thank you for your question. (Operator Instructions) Next line of question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner of CJS. Please proceed. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS: A couple of follow-up starting with follow-up on Rafael\u2019s question, obviously two figures I think are impacting people\u2019s view of the industry, customer consolidation which would lead to dramatic changes in research in a short terms basis and also more concern over pricing of new orphan-type drugs that would be more likely delivered by biologics or through injection. Are you seeing any of these impacts yet and how would you react to it, this fear or uncertainty investors are raising? Don Morel : No, we haven\u2019t seen any impact yet and we ordinarily wouldn\u2019t until the closing happens and then usually not until anywhere from six months to a year later as they start to prioritize their R&D program. Usually by that time, they've made decisions and are fully aware of who they're are going to put on stability, especially for the drugs that are entering Phase III or are in Phase III. So there is quite a lag between when it\u2019s announced and when we actually see an impact. On the biologic side, we usually don\u2019t see one because of the strength of the position of the Westar non-coated closures within that particular segment. So haven\u2019t seen any impact yet. It usually happens when the product transfer start by that usually is not for lengthy period of time after the actual merger takes place. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS: But you're not hearing your customers indicate to you, be careful, we could see a dramatic change in the way we spend R&D or otherwise at this point? Don Morel : No. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS: Okay. And then going back to the initial roll out or testing quantities of both CZ and SmartDose, could you comment on the types of margin you are getting now but importantly what you think you'll get when they do reach commercial volumes? Don Morel : Yes, it\u2019s a traditional manufacturing run where in the early going, where you're doing small sample runs and you're not at volume and the margins you are lower. We expect our efficiencies will improve dramatically as we ramp up volumes. I think you will see fairly traditional device volumes out of both of those as we go through commercial sales and that would be north of 45% or 50% on a gross margin. Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS: And then just a quick follow up on SmartDose. I know you manufactured in Israel. Clearly there is uncertainty related to Israel. I know you are building a facility. Have you seen any impact yet at all in your facility there and are you seeing customers change their order patterns to try to allow for that uncertainty? Don Morel : No, our facilities are secure, our folks are working. There has been no disruption to this point. Obviously we encourage them to take all measures to stay safe. We have contingency plans that we put into place for manufacturing for the products that come out of Israel that we could put into place should the situation dictate it. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next round of question comes from the line of Rafael Tejada of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Just one quick follow up -- just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly on EPS for Q3. I guess you're expecting just a couple -- did you say $0.02 of growth year-over-year? And also just wondering if you can just talk I guess about -- I know this seasonality in Q3 typically to the degree that it might just differ from what we\u2019ve seen in the past? Don Morel : Yes, I think we talked about a modest increase in Q3 versus prior year, Rafael. This is why we don\u2019t guide the quarters. We are more comfortable with the guidance for the full year and as we\u2019ve talked about on the call, we\u2019ve reaffirmed that guidance. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything different out of the seasonality. We\u2019re certainly not through August yet, which is a primary period for the Europeans to do their planned shutdowns and PM&A. They key is always and we\u2019ve talked about this before, it's how efficient we are in the startup coming out of that shutdown period. So September tends to be a huge driver. If we do have some orders flip that don\u2019t fall into the quarter, they'll go into the fourth quarter then we will pick it up then. Bill Federici : The only thing I would add is that in Q3 2013, we had that big surge in high value product orders as Don mentioned earlier. So seasonality last year was a little skewed. This year it\u2019s more back to what we see as a normal. I would also mention that the high value products, we continue to see that the growth in the range that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, but the volatility from quarter-to-quarter is increasing. So we saw in the first quarter it was a -- High Value Products actually decreased versus the first quarter of the prior year. In this quarter they were up nicely 8.5%. So you have this effective Q3 2013 having been very, very high percentage growth. It was over 23% growth in High Value Products last year in the third quarter driving that good results. And it was a more modest growth in high value products in Q4 of 2013. So while we're seeing now change in the overall trajectory or the fact the macro drivers of the business, we are seeing a lot more volatility quarter-to-quarter, especially in high value products. Operator :  Thank you for your questions. The next round of question comes from the Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please proceed. Dave Windley - Jefferies: So we had a couple of it that came to mind. One around -- a kind of a follow on to Rafael\u2019s question there. Coming out of 1Q where backlog had been down a little bit at year end and improved significantly by March, with High Value Products being kind of a big driver of that improvement, I guess I would have expected high value products to outpace overall packaging in 2Q and I think if I read this right that your constant dollar packaging was like 11% and high value was 8.5%. Am I looking at that right and why is that dynamic? Don Morel : Yes, growth in PDS was about 4.5% adjusted for currency and the HVP growth was about 8.5%. So it\u2019s roughly 2x on the HVP. Dave Windley - Jefferies: I read the 4.5% higher as meaning higher than 6.6%. So I apologize. Bill Federici : To answer the other part of your question about the volume, the dollar volume of the backlog, remember that our lead times have come down. So we would expect orders to -- the volumes of orders -- to share dollars of orders to have contracted a little bit, which it did, at same level at yearend but lower than the June 2013 number. But the percentage of high value products in the backlog has increased which is what we would expect. Dave Windley - Jefferies: And on that Bill so the -- we again joined late and I was looking to show on and we didn\u2019t hear a backlog number. Did you give a backlog number for the June 30? Bill Federici : Yes, 314, which is the equal to the 20 day, December 2013 balance and 9% lower than Q2 2013. Dave Windley - Jefferies: Okay. How about kind of penetration statistics on high value products? Are they still quite low? Don Morel : They in their 40s. We\u2019ve talked about before. Bill Federici : For the mature high value products like Westar and Teflon coating, you still have some that are very small basis and growing like Envision and like our NovaPure lines, which we see great promise into the future. We still -- as I mentioned earlier we don\u2019t see a change in the trajectory of our growth in high value products. Its grown double digits over the last five years. We continued to that. We think that it will still be in that same 8% to 12% as we go forward, with the caveat that we\u2019re seeing a lot more volatility in the quarter-to-quarter comparison. Dave Windley - Jefferies: Okay and again I\u2019ll ask one more at the risk of repeating, but you highlight that this quarter's margin did benefit quite nicely from an actual decline in SG&A cost related to a least of things that you named. How should I think about the transient and non-transient nature of that? Bill Federici : I'll take them by the numbers. The decline in the retirement benefit cost is something that we\u2019ll continue for the rest of the year. And obviously each year you have the actuary give you valuation and that dictates that what the following year\u2019s pension expense would be. If rates rise, as we all expect them do, the timing of which we don\u2019t know but if we do believe they will rise -- we believe that we'll see a further contraction in the expense. We are also putting some money into the plant that will also help reduce the expense going forward. In terms of the -- we have other things that impact it in the quarter. We had incentive compensation costs that were less. That's purely a function of the results. Our incentive compensation is driven by the performance of the Company. And if you look at last year\u2019s this time, the Company was performing, just came off some very high performance. So we looked at our bonus calculations and our incentive comp calculations and that drove them up in the prior year. This year they\u2019re not nearly as robust. So you actually have comparison, quarter-to-quarter comparison. We have less of an expense from the incentive cost. And employee medical benefit costs were also down. We are on a -- we look at the actual claims that have been made against our policies and adjust accordingly and our experience has been better than we expected and so therefore we ended up with less employee medical benefit cost in this quarter. Operator : Thank you. Thank you for your question. Ladies and gentlemen, that now concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Don Morel for closing remarks. Thank you. Don Morel : Thank you very much, Operator, and thank you everyone for your time this morning. Terrific second quarter for the Company. We look forward to reporting back to you at the end of October in our Q3 call when we\u2019ll update our long-term plans. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Enjoy the rest of you day. Thank you.",

Welcome to West's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are West's Chief Financial Officer, Bill Federici; and Mike Anderson our President and Primary Investor Relations Contact. During our commentary today, Bill and I will briefly review our results for the third quarter, discus our expectations for the remainder of 2014, provide a snapshot of our revenue outlook for 2015, and highlights from our updated five year business plan. The PowerPoint slides we will use to support our remarks can be accessed through our web site at www.westpharma.com under Investors. If for some reason you cannot access the presentation, our discussion will cover the information both in this morning's release, and the slides. As you know on October 15th, we provided an early look at our Q3 earnings. Slide number 3 provides the high level summary of our financial performance during the quarter. Sales increased just over 4% from $341.8 million to $355.9 million. Our gross margin was up slightly to 30.9% and our adjusted operating profit was $45.2 million, an increase of just under 14% resulting in a 1.1 percentage point increase in our operating margin versus the prior year period. The improvement in our operating margin yielded adjusted fully diluted earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.39 in the third quarter of 2013, an improvement of 12.8%. Slide number 4 summarizes some operating highlights in the two business segments; Packaging Systems sales increased modestly as a result of higher sales of Westar and Daikyo RS and RU components. From a geographic perspective, sales grew in North and South America; were essentially flat in Europe and down slightly in Asia. However, I should note that comparisons of our Q3 2013 results to Q3 2014 for the Packaging segment are clouded by the extraordinary third quarter we had in 2013, where high value product sales were up over 20% and overall sales for the segment were up over 14%. The real story for the quarter was the strong increase in proprietary product sales generated by the Delivery Systems group. Sales overall for the segment were up 14.8%, excluding currency effects, generated primarily by a richer mix of proprietary products, including SmartDose units for clinical trials, Medimop reconstitution systems and CZ vials and cartridges. The increase in proprietary sales was augmented by continuing solid demand for contract manufacturing services. Slide number 5 provides an update for several of our key expansion and device development programs. As previously reported, we have completed the new elastomer facility in China and the new seal facility in India. Both have begun commercial operations. Earlier in October, we announced plans for a new facility in Waterford, Ireland, to increase capacity for our proprietary rubber sheeting use in insulin packaging, and also advanced finishing operations for high value closure systems, targeted for the rapidly growing biotech market segment. The facility will be constructed in phases, as we see demand evolve with our current target to begin commercial sheeting production in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to make steady progress on our major device development program. CZ production of the 1 ml long syringe is booked through the early part of 2015, and we continue to see strong demand for CZ cartridges in support of our SmartDose programs. Stability trials underway by various customers continue to demonstrate excellent compatibility with a range of compounds. You should note that revenues during the quarter for SmartDose supporting clinical trials and customer testing exceeded $3 million. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2014, the October 15th release also provided an update for our full year guidance, which is summarized on slide number 6. We currently expect sales growth for the full year to be approximately 4% excluding currency, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.77 to $1.82, largely as a result of the strengthening of the dollar against the euro, and an increase in our forecasted tax rate, as a result of selling more high value products in higher tax regions. As we look toward 2015, discussions with a wide range of customers lead us to conclude that the issues that impacted sales at the outset of 2014, are largely behind us as orders have begun to pick up and our firm backlog has improved. We currently believe sales will grow in the range of 5% to 8% during 2015 excluding the effects of currency. Sales will again be driven by high value products and sales of existing proprietary devices, along with ongoing development programs utilizing CZ and SmartDose. High value product growth in the Pharmaceutical Packaging Group is expected to range from 8% to 10% during the year. We also completed our five year plan review and update in late September, taking into account changes in the macro environment, healthcare and market dynamics, and what we believe to be the principle drivers of our business. The major trends we previously highlighted are strong indicators of the growth potential of our business. First, demographics and the prevalence of products disease [ph]. Second, the pipeline of complex biologics to treat diseases such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and diabetes; and finally the growing need for ultra clean packaging and sophisticated delivery devices, to optimize the containment and accurate dosing of these compounds. Late stage pipelines for biologics and monoclonal antibodies in particular are very robust. During the plan period, indications are very positive, that a number of new therapeutics will gain approval, such as PD1 molecules for various cancer indications, GLP-1 for diabetes, and the emerging class of PCSK9 agents for cholesterol reduction. We are in an excellent production to capture high value products and device sales for a substantial number of these new products, and deliver value to our shareholders. Indeed, virtually all of the new molecules undergoing clinical trials in these categories will utilize high value West or Daikyo packaging systems for vial and pre-filled syringe formats. We believe revenues will fall in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion by the end of the planned period, with improved in our operating margin to between 19% and 21%. We fully anticipate revenue growth to be driven by continued uptake and expansion of the high value product lines in pharmaceutical packaging, and rapid growth in the out years of proprietary devices. This dynamic growth will require additional capital investments in 2015 and 2016 of roughly $20 million to $30 million above our previously forecasted range of approximately $125 million to $145 million per year. As a quick summary, our performance in Q3 was solid driven by proprietary growth. However comparisons are difficult due to the extraordinary third quarter delivered by the Packaging Systems Group in 2013. Our backlog is significantly stronger at $349 million, and strong demand for CZ and SmartDose systems for clinical trials will continue. However, future demand will be dependent on customer plans and their filing timelines. We see no changes to our fundamental long term growth drivers and the strong and growing pipeline of biologics within our customer base should be a very strong revenue driver. We firmly believe that our 2019 revenue and margin targets that I just discussed are achievable. The Board and management team remain firmly committed to our strategic focus on ultra-clean high value packaging systems and unique delivery devices to meet the growing demand to cover our market and complex biologic molecules. I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Federici for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. We issued our third quarter results this morning, reporting net income of $31 million or $0.43 per diluted share versus the $0.37 per diluted share we reported in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding the effect of non-recurring items in both periods, Q3 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.44 compared to the $0.39 in the prior year quarter. A reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures is provided on slides 14 through 16. Turning to sales; slide 8 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Consolidated third quarter sales were $355.9 million, an increase of 4.2% over third quarter of 2013 sales, excluding exchange. Packaging System sales were $252 million, essentially equal to those recorded in the third quarter of 2013. As a reminder, last year's third quarter sales grew 14.7% and high value products grew 23%, driven by customer inventory management. It is a notable accomplishment to equal those sales in the current quarter, including high value packaging sales, which were about 1% higher than the prior year's quarter. Delivery Systems sales were $104 million this quarter, an increase of $13.5 million or 14.8% over the prior year quarter excluding exchange. [Indiscernible] driven by gains in both proprietary products and contract manufacturing revenues. Proprietary product improvements include $4.2 million more of administration systems products, and $3.4 million more of SmartDose sales to customer's preclinical and clinical trials. Sales of proprietary products comprised 27.4% of the segment sales in the quarter, compared to 23.6% in the prior year quarter. Contract manufacturing revenues grew $5.7 million excluding exchange, plus around higher volumes to existing programs. As provided on slide 9, our consolidated 2013 gross profit margin of 30.9% was just slightly ahead of the 30.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2013. Packaging Systems third quarter gross margin of 35.3% was $0.03 of a margin point lower than we achieved in the third quarter of 2013. While modest sales price increases largely offset rising labor and overhead costs, our products mix was slightly less profitable than the strong prior year quarter, resulting in the reduction of dose margins. Delivery Systems third quarter gross margin of 20.3% was 2.7 margin points higher than Q3 2013, due to favorable mix of products sold. As reflected on slide 10, Q3 2014 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $100,000 versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, third quarter 2014 SG&A expense was 15.7% versus 16.4% in the third quarter of 2013. Lower incentive compensation and pension costs accounted for the majority of the decrease in SG&A. Slide 11 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $136.9 million in the current year-to-date period, $4.8 million less than the comparable prior year period, during which, we received a $20 million licensing payment for SmartDose. Our capital spending was $84.8 million for the first nine months of 2014. We expect to spend approximately $125 million to $145 million in capital during 2014. Approximately half of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including the initial capital to establish the pharmaceutical component manufacturing plant in Waterford, Ireland. Slide 12 provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we are confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at September 30th was $246.8 million, an increase of $16.8 million over the December 2013 balance. A large majority of our cash is invested overseas, and is generally not available to be repatriated for the U.S., without incurring net tax consequences. However, earlier this year, we repatriated approximately $28 million of offshore cash, which we will use to pay down debt. Debt at September 30th was $342.7 million, approximately $31 million lower than at year end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter end was 9%, as it compares to 13.7% at the end of 2013. Working capital totaled $437 million at September 30th, $23 million higher than at year end. The majority of the increase is due to higher inventory and accounts receivable balances. Receivables and inventory turnover metrics are relatively consistent with the prior periods. Our backlog of committed packaging systems orders stands at $349 million at September 30th, above both year end and prior September levels. The composition of our backlog remains strong, with high value products representing approximately 45% of the orders, an increase of 2% over prior September's backlog percentage. Based on our year-to-date results and our analysis of the orders on-hand, we have updated our full year 2014 financial guidance in this morning's release. That guidance is summarized on slide 13. As we previously announced, our current guidance has been narrowed to $1.77 to $1.82 per share. The major factor reducing the top end of the guidance range, is the decline in the value of the euro versus the U.S. dollar. Our previous guidance was based on a $1.37 per euro rate, current guidance uses the market rate of $1.27 per euro. That change reduced earnings per share estimates by $0.04. Additionally, we have raised our effective tax rate assumption by one point to 27%. As outlined in this morning's release, our Board approved a share repurchase program, which allows us to buy back up to $100 million of our common stock in open market, privately negotiated transaction, and is expected to be completed by December 31, 2015. We expect the repurchase program will be funded with existing debt capacity and cash, if available. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Don Morel. Don? Don Morel : Thank you very much, Bill. This concludes our prepared remarks for this morning, and we now look forward to answering your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions). Please standby for your first question, which comes from Arnie Ursaner at CJS Securities. Go ahead please. Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities : Hi. Good morning. Don Morel : Good morning Arnie. Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities : My first question is, regarding your Q4 on high end packaging being relatively flat, should we assume it's primarily due to the fact that you're up against another extremely difficult comp and not signaling any change in the underlying business? Don Morel : No. I think what you are going to see is the usual end of the year stuff with our customers, in terms of ordering and delivery patterns. We are being a little bit conservative. Q4 really was a slightly weaker quarter in 2013 for HVPs in the third quarter. So we started to see the down trend at that point, and as a reminder, that's when the orders started to decline as a result of a detergent change in our process in Europe. Bill Federici : Arnie, actually to correct you a little bit;, the Q4 growth we expect for high value products will be greater than what it was in 2013. 2013, as Don mentioned, we started to see the effect of customers working down their inventory balances. So actually, the comp to last year's fourth quarter is not nearly as tough for high value products. We expect about a 4.7% increase over that. And as we said, the backlog, if you look at it as of September, the composition of high value products in the backlog has actually increased by two percentage points over September 2013 to 45%. Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities : Next question is in your pharma Packaging Systems margin in the quarter was lower than we have modeled. And in your prepared remarks, you highlighted increased sales of the disposable medical device components. When you presented your slide with various balls or areas showing margin? That's the piece that's in the very lower left, that's the high volume but lowest margin business, is that correct? Bill Federici : It\u2019s a combination of two, it\u2019s the standard product and the lower profit disposable medical device components. Those two are actually up in the quarter. Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities : Okay. And going back to this capital spending increase relative to let's say your five year plan, can you kind of walk us through the thought process on why the spending -- the incremental spending is going to be pretty significant for the next few years, but yet your views really don't accelerate till kind of 2017, 2018, 2019. Is that much of a leadtime you need to have to build this out, and maybe be more specific, what is leading you to decide you need to increase it? Don Morel : There is really two answers to the question Arnie. So the first one on the pharmaceutical packaging side is that, as you know, we produce this specialized sheeting for insulin cartridges, and we only have a single facility that produces that material. So this is simultaneously a risk mitigation step for the major customers we serve, but also, to support growth we see in that marketplace through that five year period. So the first part of the facility in Ireland will be a sheeting facility. We expect to build that out in the latter years, as we see there is cleanliness requirement increasing and the focus on the very high margin, high valued products going into the biologics segment. Ireland was an ideal location for us, because of increasing investment by our customer base. When you look at the biologics production capability within that area, it has increased substantially and will increase in the future, as we see more compounds come out. So much of it is aimed at high margin, high growth areas, diabetes and biologics. The second is that, we are currently producing commercially the SmartDose system in Israel, and part of that capital is to begin to fit our commercial production in Arizona, as we see requirements not only for CZ, but for the SmartDose devices ramp up. We would like to have dual source of supply there for risk mitigation. So the reasons are all good, they are growth, and yes, we have to invest that far ahead of the curve, with validation, equipment delivery and all the reasons we have talked about in the past. Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities : Okay. And I am violating my only ask two question rules, but I want to ask one more real quick, you are tied to the price of Brent crude more than most companies which are West Texas [ph]. We have obviously seen a very dramatic lowering of oil prices. How should we think about that, as you go to your year end negotiations with your customers, and maybe remind everyone of the lag before you have it impacting your costs, or your contract pricing? Bill Federici : That is exactly right Arnie. We have -- to answer the last part first, we have about a three month lag between when the actual price of Brent declines and when we start to see it come through in our purchases, and then approximately a two month delay between when we get it into our inventory, and when we actually end up selling it, and therefore it ends up in our income statement. So it's about somewhere between four and six months of a delay. The sharp decline that you're talking about, its really not as dramatic as some of the ones that we have seen in the past. If we go back to 2011, you will remember that Brent went from about $65, $70 a barrel, up to over $130 if I remember correctly, during that first half of the year, and then came down in the back half of the year. So with the decline, you should expect to see lower and you saw it in the third quarter, you saw it that our raw material costs were essentially flat to the prior year, you will see a little bit lower costs coming through, starting some time in 2015, probably the latter part of the first quarter. But as you're suggesting, about half of our Packaging Systems sales are under contract with our customers, and those contracts generally carry a CPI or PPI accelerator in them. So obviously, we would see lower ability to increase prices. All that said, when we look at 2015 and to come to the guidance that we gave you on the sales, we have not included a large increase for pricing. I believe we are about 0.5%, which will be below the five year average and certainly way below the 2.5% or so that we received in the 2012-2013 timeframes. Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities : Thank you very much. Bill Federici : You're welcome. Don Morel : Thanks Arnie. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Rafael Tejada at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning and thank you for the questions. Don Morel : Good morning Rafael. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just on the 2015 outlook on a constant currency growth, how should we think about the growth in packaging versus delivery? Bill Federici : Basically, its going to be in the Packaging Systems side. High value products driving the bulk of the growth, so we expect high value products will grow nicely in that 8% to 10% range as Don described. We will see less growth coming from the standard and disposable medical device side of that business. For the Delivery Systems side, we see very solid growth in the proprietary delivery systems. That should be up solid double digits, similar to the 15% to 20% range, and as you can imagine for contract manufacturing, we'd expect something in the order of mid-singles, as a growth rate. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So if I were to net that out, I mean packaging probably as a whole in the mid-single digits and delivery systems, somewhere lower -- low double digits? Bill Federici : On the Delivery Systems, you are going to be less than a little bit double digits, because you had -- remember it's only -- the Proprietary Systems at only about 27% of the total. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And we covered one of the trends in terms of the fluctuating raw material prices, but also wanted to talk about infectious diseases and just wondering what -- whether you're already -- there is some data out there suggesting potential stronger flu season this year, so just wondering if there is any -- if you're seeing any orders coming in? And secondly, just anything on -- in terms of potential tailwinds from travel activity as it relates to Ebola? Don Morel : Yeah on the first question, I think the answer is no. Much of the flu stocks of course are produced in advance of the season. So those numbers have already been reflected in our sales. With regard to Ebola specifically, remember the trials often are relatively small volumes, and people are I think in many respects, playing catch-up. So even if you have a 5,000 patient trial, its not going to drive the needle, those are very-very small volumes. The answer is that yes, we are on some of the vaccines that are in development, but you are not going to see that drive the numbers. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And just a couple other housekeeping items; we have seen the fluctuations in currency, just wondering what's baked in, in terms of headwind for sales in MEPS for Q4, and if you can talk about potential expectations for 2015? Bill Federici : Well I will start with the end first; as we said, the number we recorded, the 5% to 8% for 2015 is an ex-currency number. So that hopefully will help you, and you can draw whatever conclusions you want. On the fourth quarter, we view as the $1.27 to the euro, which is not what it is this morning of course, things bounce around, and that's pretty close to what we believe the market is for the quarter. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. But to think of a potential 2% headwind on the top line for Q4, that would be a prudent number to use, just to make sure that -- Bill Federici : I don't think that that's an unreasonable expectation; especially versus our prior guidance. And Rafael, just let me finish; with the full year guidance that we took down narrowing the range, $0.04 of that is due to currency. Some of that is in the third quarter, some of it is in the fourth, so that gives you a gauge to put on in the fourth quarter. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And with the share repurchase being planned, how should we think about the deployment of that plan and I guess what has been the expectations for share comp for 2014 and then just finally -- just tax rate, we saw that pick up, just wondering if we should be using that sort of similar rate for 2015? Bill Federici : The tax rate is -- what we are believing is somewhere in that blended year, somewhere in that 27% range, maybe although higher if we don't get beyond the extendable cash, that you know, has an impact on all manufacturers. And going forward, if you are using -- again, if they have the extendable cash, 27% would not be an unreasonable expectation going forward. On the share count, we do have an increase planned, about 0.5 million shares in the count. But the exact way that the share buyback program will hit, is really depending on -- from time to time, we will go into the market when we see the opportunity to go in and buy. Rafael Tejada - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Don Morel : Thanks Rafael. Operator : Thank you. Sir you have no further questions at this time. (Operator Instructions). And we do have another question, this comes from Dana Walker at Kalmar Investments. Please go ahead. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : Hello there. Good morning. Don Morel : Good morning Dana. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : Don, talk about zero defect? How is that a step function above what your customers have been focusing on, on the HVP fronts, and how does that change the product and/or service life that you're in a position to provide? Don Morel : We and all of our customers are seeing a great deal of, what I would call, incentives from the regulatory bodies to look into the entire production process, in terms of continuous improvement. And as detection capabilities get better and better, when you inspect at the end of the line, you're seeing more and more things. So we look at it purely as an opportunity, and for us, it is a differentiator, and again, its driving a lot of the investments that will happen in Ireland in the second phase of that building. But as a service offering, it really comes back to the attributes that we would try to put into the closures from Westar, evolving all the way to the current version of [indiscernible]. Each one of those attribute gives us the opportunity to capture some value from what our customers ordinarily would have provided in their own production processes in prior years. So we don't think those pressures are going to relent. Indeed, its going to put pressure on the industry, to meet what is a rapidly increasing quality standard. So its an opportunity and a challenge all in the same nut. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : Understood. Bill, as you update your revenue guidance, how much of that would you attribute to currency, and how much of that would you attribute to something else? Bill Federici : Yeah absolutely, ignore currency in the growth that we gave you. The 5% to 8%, Dana, is a currency neutral number. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : I am talking about Q4. Bill Federici : Okay. Q4 we had between somewhere around $0.02 is what we are expecting versus what we had previously guided you to. And its $0.04 for the back half of the year between when we gave you guidance on July 30th or whenever it was, versus the $1.27 we are giving you now. So roughly half of that would be what's impacting the fourth quarter. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : I am sorry, I should have been much more specific. I was focused solely on the top line. Bill Federici : Top line; the amount that impacts it? Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : Well you brought your revenue guidance down moderately for PPS, how much of that is currency, how much of that would be something else? Bill Federici : Okay. In terms of -- almost all of it is currency, and there is some -- obviously, there is some impacts from the business from looking at the backlog and where we ended the third quarter. But a good chunk of that is due to currency. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : The committed backlog number that you provided, can you just quickly update us as to what the comparable numbers might have been earlier than a year ago at this time? Bill Federici : Absolutely. If you look at the backlog at this year and at the end of September, it was $349 million. Now, you have currency impacts, impacting the comparisons, but I will give you the currency neutral numbers. Q3 2013 was $325 million rough numbers, and December 2013 was $315 million rough numbers. Now in those numbers or disclosure, there is a blanket order from one of our major customers, that impacts the comparability. So that's why, when we gave you the $349 million, we don't know exactly, we can't pull out exactly how much of that is in excess of what we had at end of September of 2013 or December of 2013, but it does impact comparability. So instead of being, for instance, up 14% versus December, we know its something less than that, its probably on the order of mid to high singles. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : One last question, Don, you mentioned three new biologic categories that are appearing in the rearview mirror, or for that matter in the windshield, can you describe, timing-wise, when you would expect to see product flows from there and thus demand for your products? Don Morel : Yeah, I categorize it really as two new, one existing. So the GLP ones have been in the market for a while, but we are seeing some new molecules coming down in that diabetes category and some new indication, several of them, I believe, have gotten approval of the weight loss indication, in addition to share level reduction. The PD1 is the new molecules for cancer. I believe it goes -- will roll out probably over the next two to three years. We know that several of our customers -- we know one customer that has an approval already in the market for lung cancer. But you will see sequentially approval for different types of cancer, as they complete the clinical trials and do rolling submissions for each one of those. There are several other PD-1s that are in the application phase have not received approval yet, but we think that's going to be a very-very strong category, because of the uniqueness of these molecules; and again, we are virtually on all of the packaging, that goes both in vial and syringe format. The final category, the PCSK9 molecules are completely new in terms of cholesterol reduction. Again, we are on the primary packaging for that. We will have to see how the device equation evolves, but each one of the categories, we believe presents not only primary packaging, but potentially downstream device opportunities. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : As you have seen the GLP-1s roll out, has that proven to be incremental demand or higher value demand for you? Or does it displace something? Don Morel : Its really hard to say. For us, it has been incremental up demand, especially in the vices where we contract manufacturer. It is difficult to call out the impact on the primary packaging side. We are not sure what goes to GLP-1s versus the insulins. Dana Walker - Kalmar Investments : Okay. I had one last question, it has evaded me for the moment, so I will let go. Thanks. Bill Federici : Thank you so much Dana. Operator : Gentlemen, there are no further questions for you at the moment. Don Morel : Thank you very much for your time everyone. We look forward to speaking with you again in February with our year end call. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Don Morel, West's Chairman and CEO. Don? Don Morel : Thank you very much John and good morning everyone. Welcome to West's 2014 year-end earnings call. Joining me on the call today are West's Chief Financial Officer, Bill Federici; and Mike Anderson our Treasurer and Primary Investor Relations contact. In our prepared remarks, Bill and I will briefly review our results for the fourth quarter; we will talk on our accomplishments for 2014 and discuss our outlook for 2015. During our commentary, we will once again refer to a PowerPoint slide deck, which can be accessed through our website at www.westpharma.com under Investors. If for some reason you cannot access the presentation, our discussion will cover the information both, in this morning's release and the slides. Let me begin with Slide 3, which provides a high-level summary of our fourth quarter results. Although 2014 started slower than expected as a result of inventory adjustments by several European customers and weakness in certain generic accounts, West finished the year on a strong note with demand improving across virtually all key product lines. For the quarter, sales increased to $349.8 million or just over 7% excluding the effects of currency and the Q3 2014 disposition of a small tooling operation in Europe. Our gross margin was up slightly to 31.4% and our adjusted operating profit was $44.6 million, an increase of approximately 29% at constant exchange rates. The improvement in our operating profit yielded adjusted fully diluted earnings per share of $0.45 versus $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Slide number four was operating highlights for the two business segments. Revenue growth in Packaging System benefited from stronger sales in North America and South America and Europe, increasing 7.7% versus a year ago. High-value product sales grew just over 12%, driven by Weststar and Daikyo RSV. The favorable product mix, pricing and operating efficiencies lifted the segments gross margin by 1.3 margin points. These factors combined with prudent as SG&A and R&D spending, generated an $8.9 million increase in operating profits during the quarter. In the Delivery Systems group, sales were up just over 1%, which translates to over 6% when the effects of currency and the interim business disposition are removed. Gross margin in this business suffered a bit from some shifting of cost of R&D to cost of sales as projects begin to generate revenue. This contributed to the 14% increase in proprietary product sales in the quarter, but also slightly lowered margins associated with some of those revenues at this stage of their development. Overall, the PDS group continued to make measurable progress against our long-term objectives with the cost of those efforts muted by growth in administration systems and good performance from our contract manufacturing business. For the full year, as outlined in our release, sales grew to just over $1.4 billion or 4.3% excluding currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $1.78, a year-over-year increase of just over 9%, and our third consecutive year of record sales and earnings. Slide number five provides an update for several of the key expansion and device development programs. Our new facility in India expands our metal field production capacity, and with more than 20 customers qualified and placing production orders is well ahead of plan and should turn profitable by early 2016. As production shifts to this plant, our operations team in Asia will be converting the old field production space in our Singapore facility to high-value product production to meet future demands of the growing Asian market. In our third quarter call, we also announced plans for a new facility in Waterford, Ireland to meet anticipated future demands for our proprietary insulin packaging systems and advanced finishing operation for high-value closure systems. Site preparation will be completed by the end of the quarter and we expect to complete all necessary permitting and begin construction in the next few months. In addition, we are adding high-value product capacity by converting our Kinston North Carolina facility, which has historically produced lower margin components for single-use devices such as syringes. The transfer of that work and the addition of capabilities has been in process now for several years and we expect that to come online in the second half of 2015. With regard to high-value products, we introduced the NovaPure product line in 2012, and since that time have been working with a number of customers to facilitate qualification and validation for use on existing products. We have also been expanding the number of components we offer under the NovaPure brand and have recently received our first commercial orders. While it will not be a major revenue contributor in the near-term, the NovaPure line represents the next generation of West closure that address the market need for ultraclean high-quality products. Turning to the Delivery Systems group, 2014 was the year of significant progress across the portfolio of proprietary device development programs currently underway. Demand for the 1 ml long CZ insert needle syringe strengthened during the latter half of the year, primarily for stability testing and line trials. More importantly, at the end of 2014, the number of molecules undergoing formal stability testing has more than doubled from the beginning of the year. A total of eight customers funded development programs based on the SmartDose platform are now underway for a range of therapeutic applications requiring high dose volumes. Given the expanding CZ cartridge demand we are experiencing, we are installing additional capacity at our Scottsdale, Arizona device facility to augment the Daikyo line in Japan. We are also accelerating plans to add backup capacity for manufacture and assembly of the device in Arizona to provide added assurance of our ability to satisfy anticipated increased demand for the device. For the year and across all programs and customers, West has now delivered more than 100,000 devices in an access of nearly 800,000 CZ cartridges for a range of pre-clinical, clinical and stability testing and the devices being on over 1,500 subjects and user studies and clinical trials. As we look at 2015, our order book is solidified and our firm backlog has grown 15% at constant currency versus the year ago. The timing and composition of the backlog are important factors in our expectations that sales for the full-year will grow in a range of 6% to 8%, excluding the effects of currency. Sales will again be driven by high-value products for high-value biologics, rising sales of proprietary devices and requirements for ongoing development programs utilizing CZ and SmartDose. Ex-currency high-value product sales growth in the pharmaceutical packaging group is expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range versus 2014. Although, the underlying organic growth of the business is healthy, our full-year sales and earnings will be subject to the currency headwind from the strong US dollar. For the full-year and 2014 the euro-dollar exchange rate averaged $1.33, whereas at the outset of 2015, that rate has been as low as $1.11 and is near the lower end of that range today. Assuming an exchange rate of $1.15 for the remainder of the year, currency translation would be expected to reduce sales by approximately $80 million and EPS by $0.18 to $0.20 per share. On that basis, we estimate our 2015 adjusted earnings of the $1.74 to $1.92 per fully diluted share. However, for the longer-term, the major trends we have previously highlighted remain strong indicators of the growth potential of our business. Late-stage pipelines for biologics and monoclonal antibodies in particular are very robust. During 2014, the first approvals were granted PD1 molecules for various cancer indications. Throughout 2015, we expect a number of new biologic approval, including emerging class of PCSK9 agents for cholesterol reduction. There is also the potential for the first U.S. biosimilar PD approved under the new pathway. We are in an excellent position to capture high-value product and device sales for a substantial number of these new products. Indeed, virtually all of these molecules undergoing clinical trials in these categories will utilize high-value West or Daikyo packaging systems of vial and pre-filled syringe format. Regarding the CEO succession plan that we announced late last year, the search process is well underway and the Board is vetting a very strong candidate list. I have committed to the Board that I will continue to serve in my current role until my successor is in place and the transition is completed. I would now like to turn the call over the Bill Federici for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Don. Good morning, everyone. We issued our fourth quarter results this morning. Excluding the effects of special items from both periods, fourth quarter 2014 earnings were $0.45 per diluted share versus the $0.38 we earned in Q4 2013. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided on Slides 13 and 14. Turning to sales, Slide 7 shows the components of a consolidated sales increase. Consolidated fourth quarter sales were $349.8 million, an increase of 7.4% over fourth quarter 2013 sales, excluding exchange and the disposition of a small business. Packaging Systems' sales increased by $18.5 million or 7.7% over same quarter 2013 sales excluding exchange. A favorable sales mix and volume growth accounted for 6.8 percentage points of the increase, modestly higher selling prices in Packaging Systems contributed to the remainder of the increase. High-value product sales increased 12.1% versus the prior year quarter excluding exchange. For the full year 2014, high-value product sales increased 3.5% versus 2013, excluding exchange. Delivery Systems sales increased $3 million or 2.9% over sales in the prior quarter, excluding exchange effects. The sales increase was driven by our proprietary businesses. Sales of proprietary products increased 14.2% to $28.6 million or 27.4% of the segment's revenues in the quarter. CZ sales and development activity were approximately $4 million and SmartDose sample sales were $3.5 million in Q4. On the full year basis, total 2014 proprietary product sales grew 13.6% over 2013. As provided on Side 8, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q4 2014 was 31.4% versus the 31.1% margin we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. Packaging Systems' fourth quarter gross margin of 36.2% is 1.3 margin points higher than the 34.9% achieved in the fourth quarter of '13. The favorable mix and volume of product sold, modest sales price increases and continued lead savings and plant efficiencies, more than offset the impact of higher general inflationary costs. Delivery Systems' fourth quarter gross margin was 19.6%, 2.2 margin points lower than the prior quarter. The lower margin was mainly due to new capacity costs and the cost associated with development projects moving to clinical production and customer funded development programs. As reflected on Slide 9, Q4 2014 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $1.2 million compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease is due primarily to lower estimated achievement levels on incentive comp programs, decreases on our pension costs and lower travel and entertainment costs. As a percentage of sales, Q4 2014 SG&A expense was seven-tenths of a percentage point less than the prior year period. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $183 million for the full year '14, $38 million less than 2013, due primarily to the $80 million of voluntary pension contribution we made in 2014 and the $20 million non-refundable customer payment received in 2013 for SmartDose. Capital additions of roughly $112 million made in 2014, roughly half of the spend was our new products and expansion efforts. We expect capital additions of between $150 million and $175 million in 2015, including approximately $35 million of cost associated with the new Ireland facility. Slide 11 provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we are confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at year end was $255 million, $25 million higher than our December 13 balance. The majority of our cash is invested overseas and is generally not available for repatriation without tax consequences. However, we repatriated $60 million of overseas cash during Q4, a portion of which was contributed to our pension plan, and a portion was used to pay down debt. Debt at year and was $337 million, $37 million less than the prior year end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at year end was 7.8%, a significant improvement from 2013's year end ratio. Working capital totaled $407 million at year-end, $7 million last than the prior year end. Our high cash balances will partially offset by the reclassification to short-term of our $25 million Series B floating rate debt maturing in 2015. Our backlog of committed PPS orders remained strong at $340 million as of December 2014, approximately 15% higher than the 2013 balances, excluding exchange. The high value portion of our current order backlog continues to increase versus the prior year. We have issued our full year 2015 guidance in this morning's release. That guidance is summarized on Slide 12. Our guidance is based on an exchange rate of $1.15 per euro. Our actual 2014 results are translated at $1.33 per euro rate. Each one penny strengthening of the dollar versus the euro would result in about a $0.01 reduction in full year EPS as a result of translation. As a reminder, most of our exposure to currency is translation risk and the majority of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged. In the first quarter of 2015, we expect sales to increase 5% to 10% ex-currency as compared to the prior year first quarter, which was adversely impacted by customer inventory management. As a result, we expect Q1 2015 earnings to increase by 15% to 25% ex-currency versus the prior year quarter. The currency impact in Q1 2015 is expected to be larger than any other quarter, as Q1 2014 average dollar per euro exchange rate was $1.37 per euro, the highest of any of the 2014 quarters. We expect to deliver on our full year earnings guidance of $1.74 to $1.92 per diluted share, which on a constant currency basis represents an increase of between 9% and 19% in diluted EPS over 2014. I would now like to turn the call back over to Don Morel. Don? Don Morel : Thanks very much, Bill. This concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. We would now be pleased to answer any questions? Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Larry Solow : Good morning, guys, just a couple of quick questions. Don Morel : Good morning, Larry. Bill Federici : Good morning, Larry. Larry Solow : You had some pretty nice growth in your higher value especially in the quarter and even for the year. Just in terms of gross margin, I know it did go up a little bit, but I thought maybe the lift would be even a little higher. Were there other factors that held it back a little bit? Don Morel : No. It is just the composition of the HVP growth. A large part of it was commercialization of the Daikyo RSV line. That has produced in Japan and we served as their agent, so we do not capture as much margin off of that. Larry Solow : Okay. Just in terms of the marketplace competitive pressures and what not, there has been a lot of chatter or some chatter on the competitive front, the OmniPod from Unilife and Aptar Stelmi, I think, they recently introduced the new coated stopper. Maybe you could take opportunity to discuss a couple of these things? Don Morel : Well, you know, competitive landscape continuously shifts. The OmniPod is the unique device that is being used by one customer that has a very unique time release requirement within that system and they began work on that a number of years ago. It does not directly compete in many applications with the SmartDose, where we want high volume delivery over the lengthy period of time. With regard to competitors in coated closure market, our position there is well-known, our brands are well-established. I believe that the product that was introduced is only on serum closure, so it is somewhat limited niche in the marketplace, but I continue to like our position there and I like all of the new product iterations that we have been introducing, including NovaPure, so we are in a good position. Larry Solow : Great. Thanks. Thanks, Don. I appreciate it. Don Morel : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Thanks for your question. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Rafael Tejada from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Rafael Tejada : Hi. Good morning and thanks for the question. Don Morel : Hey, good morning, Rafael. Bill Federici : Good morning, Rafael. Rafael Tejada : Just want to dig in a little bit more on the guidance for the full-year and for Q1, so let me start off with the full year. It looks like you are raising a constant currency outlook just slightly. Previously it was 528 now upper-end of 628. Is that mainly driven on where the backlog levels stand today or any other or are there any other indicators that are providing you with greater confidence on the guide? Don Morel : Yes. I think it is a combination of things. One, we like the composition and the timing of the orders in the backlog, so we are going to see an up lift on the HVP side of the business, we believe, throughout the year. Second thing is that we have got a little more confidence in some of the orders that were doubly done in '13, '14 that impacted us coming back and returning to a more normal pattern. We also have the unpredictable nature of some of the product launches that we expect to happen throughout the year, but I think conservatively we expect that that will also give us a slight uptick. Rafael Tejada : Okay. That is helpful. With regard to Q1, if I remember correctly that is when the company in 2014 experienced the a bigger hit from they have inventory management the year-over-year comparison is 1%. For Q1, in 2014, it was 1% and it is probably the easiest year-over-year comparison. What is baked in into the 2015 Q1 5 to 7 constant currency growth? Is that just a slower rollout, is there any inventory management issues here or is it just the pacing of the year? Don Morel : It is a little bit of the pacing of the year, but if you remember and you started to hit on it. In the first quarter of 2014, our high-value product growth was very much impacted by inventory management that had happened at the back end of \u201913, so high-value products were down 7% in the first quarter of 2014. You are going to see, again, a more natural, we think progression of sales growth in 2015, and we expect to see return to more normalize growth in high-value products for 2015. As a reminder, I mentioned it in my script, but I will mention it again. In terms of currency headwind, the currency headwind in the first quarter of \u201815 will be pretty dramatic versus Q1 2014. The average exchange rate in 2014's first quarter was $1.37, and right now obviously we are talking about a using a rate of $1.15. Rafael Tejada : Understood. Okay. That kind of goes into my next question and just given all the moving parts radar in terms of the changes, the FX volatility along with lower oil prices, so how do we think about the margin expansion for 2015? Don Morel : Again, we think good high value product growth will translate into a favorable mix. We believe that we will have some favorability in the oil prices as you are suggesting. We think that general inflationary cost will be about where we expect them to be relatively tame. We are going to get a little better prices, we believe, somewhere on the order of less than 1%, so when you factor all of those things in and the continuation of our lien programs, we believe that we should be able to see margin expansion in both sides of the business both, in the Packaging business and in the Delivery Systems. Rafael Tejada : Okay. Just one housekeeping what tax rate are you assuming for 2015? Don Morel : We are using 27 overall, but in the first half of the year, since they have not enacted the R&D tax credit again for 2015, it picks up about half a 0.5% for the first half of the year. Rafael Tejada : Okay. I do appreciate the update on the CEO search. Don the timing should we still be expecting a transition by May of this year? Don Morel : That is the process depend [ph] Rafael. The Board is making good progress, but as you can appreciate with some of the individuals involved, there may be special circumstances to push things out a bit. I think the important thing is that for continuity, I will be here until we are all comfortable the transition will be a smooth one. Rafael Tejada : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Bill Federici : Thanks, Rafael. Don Morel : Thanks, Rafael. Operator : Thanks for your question. Next question comes from Dana Walker from Kalmar Investments. Please go ahead. Dana Walker : Hey, there. Don Morel : Good morning, Dana. Dana Walker : Good morning. Bill, I think you may have confused people. If the Q1 comparison is easy as the 5% to 7% is that a constant currency numbers or is that a reported number? Bill Federici : That is a constant currency 5% to 7%. Dana Walker : Despite the easy compare and the likelihood that the high-value product compare would be strong that 5% to 7% would be sort of frame, the middle to the upper-middle, but not the above the top end of the range for the year? Bill Federici : Correct. Dana Walker : Okay. Bill Federici : It is still some and all of those factors that we have talk about high-value products returning, continued progress in the delivery system space, but it is not in immediate, it is not turn the lights switch off at the end of \u201914 and turning on in \u201815. It will build, so our best guess based on the backlog that we have today and the timing of those the orders we just believe that 5% to 7% ex-currency is the best estimate we have today. Dana Walker : Question on currency, can you and do you manage the business differently amongst all the different pressure points that you might have with the adversity of the exchange rate? Bill Federici : As you can expect, there are certain things we can do in certain regions, we have got the natural hedging that takes place, where we can make and sell basically in the same current. We do hedge oil and some of our raw materials as it is appropriate, but do not actively hedge in the translation issue. There are some things that we can control on the OpEx side that we will. Oil is a little bit complicated, because of the nature of our supply contracts and the way that is consumed in the manufacturing process, so we expect a bit of the tailwind from that in the latter half of the year. Collectively, all those things are going to allows to mitigate some of the FX impact, but the change has been so dramatic over the last three to five months, we are not going to be able to mitigate all of it. Dana Walker : I suppose early in a year, no need in trying to be terribly precise and tight and yet your range seems to be quite large. Can you talk about the variables that would apply at the lower end of your range versus those that might apply to the higher end? Bill Federici : Yes. I mean we talked about all of them, so we will repeat them. It is the uptake of the return to a more normal patterns for the high-value products, it is the timing of devices and the proprietary device portfolio and a lot of the programs that Don talked about, the sampling involved with them and hopeful eventual increase in sales resulting from those. On the pricing side, we know we are going to have very modest ability to pass among pricing, Don talked about oil, it won't be as nearly a benefit today as it is perhaps in the second half of the year, if of course, if oil prices remain paying the way we are now in that $50 to $60 range, we should get a nice tailwind from that. Lean operations and the efficiencies in our plant continuing to work on the cost side of the equation. We will of course do that and try everything we can. When we look at the totality of the picture, Dana, and we think about all of those variables and the volatility of some of the factors with our customers and how they operate in around their own inventories and the regulators, and how the regulators impact on our customers. As a reminder, we have $340 million worth of backlog. In current business, we have over $1 billion of sales, so there is a big piece of that that will all roll in over the rest of the ensuing months in the next few quarters. At this time of year, we try to be as thoughtful as we can about how all those variables will impact and the 174 to 192 is the best estimate that we had at this point and time. Dana Walker : Understood, Don. You talked about the therapeutic categories that are most visible for some of your proprietary products on the delivery front. Can you shed some additional light if you can about your view as to what proportion of the customer needs might come within CZ or within SmartDose versus some other option? Don Morel : It is hard to say because of the way our customers look at a device as part of their overall product launch and life extension strategy, as I look at it currently, we are participating on virtually all of these, mostly with closure systems for the vial and the syringe presentations. In the larger categories, many of those such as the PD1s are going to be mostly infusion, so they are going to be done in a care center as opposed to a home environment. On the other drugs, we are in a good position, so I would say the lifestyle devices, they are going to become more and more important to chronic diseases on things like cancer and MS it is not so much. Dana Walker : The PD1 and the PCSK9 and biosimilars, I believe, you referenced as being categories where SmartDose and where CZ would apply or is it more expansive description of where you would be involved? Don Morel : Yes. CZ potentially applies to all of them. The high value therapeutics where you have issues with breakage either in manufacturing or presentations in an auto-injector or the drug is just aggressive, we think CZ is the primary container, has broader application. SmartDose is going to be, again, those applications, where a high-volume has to be delivered over time and they can be done in a home setting or somewhere else. A lot of the oncologic drugs you do not want to do that, because of the toxic nature, so the categories that you mentioned, SmartDose for rheumatoid arthritis potentially for cholesterol reduction and others is going to be its biggest area of application. Dana Walker : One final question on that, you addressed how your understanding as to where customers would be, would be more evidenced by year-end and yet what are you able to conclude now about trial length, trial conclusion and how the regulatory pathway would be affected by these things? Don Morel : Well, it all comes back to the timing of when the drugs that are on formal stability, come off-formal stability. We know of some customers that began trials in the latter part of '13, early part of '14 that data will be coming through the end of its two-year shelf life study at the close of '15, beginning of the '16. We are hoping that we have a pretty good picture as to the commercialization potential for those molecules as we move towards the fourth quarter. Dana Walker : I will step back. Thank you. Good stuff. Bill Federici : Thank you, Dana. Operator : Thank you for your question. I will now pass the call over to Don Morel for closing remark. Don Morel : Thank you much, everybody. We appreciate your time this morning. We look forward to speaking you again at the end of our first quarter call, which will take place in April. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the call for today. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Morel, West's Chairman. Don? Don Morel : Thank you very much, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to West's first quarter 2015 earnings call. I\u2019m joined this morning by Bill Federici, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Anderson, our Treasurer and Primary Investor Relations contact. I\u2019m also pleased to welcome Eric Green to the West team who, as was announced on April 15, was recently appointed West\u2019s next Chief Executive Officer. Before Bill and I deliver our remarks on the quarter and our outlook for the year, I'd like to introduce Eric to provide a little background on his experience in Sigma-Aldrich and initial thoughts on joining West. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying it\u2019s a privilege to be here today as a member of the West community. West has a story 90-year history working alongside customers to provide innovative solution that impact patients lives around the world. As a chemist by training, I had the good fortune to develop my career in a scientific environment focused on enabling customers to improve the quality of life. And I\u2019m excited to continue that same journey at West. I spent 22 years with Sigma-Aldrich in multiple domestic and international markets that serve the research community including pharmaceutical and biotech firms and also provide small molecule and biologic active pharmaceutical ingredients to those end markets. As a market leader, Sigma-Aldrich was always focused on delivering innovative solutions for its global customers many of whom are also West customers. So it\u2019s safe to say I've spent my entire career in an environment that has much in common with West, a global market leader in its own space, and a company focused on expanding, improving its product, technology and services to meet the changing needs of its customers. Our products are directly involved in delivering care to patients tens of millions of time each day. That\u2019s an exceptional achievement, a big responsibility and exciting opportunity for West and for me. For the next two months, I will work with Don to ensure a smooth transition. I will update you on our results and the outlook at our next quarterly call in July. For today, I want to conclude my brief remarks by thanking Don for his visionary leadership over the past 13 years as Chairman and CEO at West. As a result of this leadership, we are positioned well for a bright future. We have a solid management team, strong financial foundation to build upon, and long term strategies that position us well to pursue new growth opportunities in new markets and geographies. I\u2019m looking forward to working with the West team to continue our success into the future. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Don. Don Morel : Thanks, Eric, and again, welcome on board. Turning to our first quarter results, slide number three provides a high level summary of our financial performance during the quarter. The improving demand we experienced at the end of 2014 carried into the first quarter of 2015 especially for our high value product lines in the pharmaceutical packaging segment. Unfortunately, the true strength in our underlying business was matched by the relatively rapid strengthening of the dollar against the euro, which started in late 2014 and carried through the first quarter.  Our reported revenue were $335.9 million versus $346.8 million in the prior year period. At constant exchange rates, sales actually grew by 6.5% driven by demand for high value products in North America and Europe. Our gross margin improved by two full points to 32.7% and adjusted net income grew by more than 21% resulting in earnings per fully diluted share of $0.45 an 18.4% increase. Overall, a good start to the year with positive momentum as we begin the second quarter. Slide number four list operating highlights for the two business segments. Revenue growth in the packaging system division benefited from stronger sales in North America, South America and Europe increasing 7.7% versus the year ago at constant exchange rates. High value product sales grew just over 19% driven by Envision, FluroTec, Westar and Daikyo RSV. A very favorable product mix coupled with excellent operating efficiencies led to this segment's gross margin 3.7 margin points to a segment record 39.1%. These factors combined with prudent SG&A and R&D spending generated an 18.5% increase in operating profit during the quarter despite the top-line impact of currency. Sales in the delivery system segment were up 5.8% excluding currency effects and the disposition of a small tooling business in late 2014. Sales benefited from growth in both the contract manufacturing services business and our proprietary product line. Gross margin in the segment fell slightly as some of our proprietary and contract manufacturing sales growth came from lower margin development agreement revenues in addition to increased spending on new capacity. Slide number five provides an update for several of our key expansion in device development program. With the recent completion of our projects in India and China, the operations team and the packaging systems group is now focused on making sure we have sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand across our advanced high value closure system such as Westar RU, FluroTec, Envision and NovaPure. This is in direct response to ever tightening regulatory and customer demand for ultra clean particulate-free system. In our Kingston, North Carolina facility, we\u2019ve added more than 20,000 square feet entirely dedicated to clean room manufacturing, B2 FluroTec coating, Westar washing and Envision final inspection. We are now in the validation phase and expect to begin shipping commercial products upon customer approval in the third quarter. Demand for the recently launched NovaPure line has been strong and, as I outlined in our February call, we continue to expand the range of products we offer under the NovaPure brand. Final design work is being completed on the facility planned for Waterford, Ireland and we expect construction to begin in the next few months. This facility will add much needed capacity for insulin packaging in addition to unique world class finishing operation for elastomer packaging components. It is targeted to begin operations in the first quarter of 2018. In the Delivery Systems Group, we are in the process of expanding our Dublin facility to accommodate additional volumes for an existing program and one substantial new program we expect to commence production in mid-2016. We\u2019re also adding SmartDose capacity to our Scottsdale, Arizona site to support anticipated growth in demand during the latter part of 2015. This expansion includes the ability to mold CZ cartridges for using SmartDose system. We were also notified by our customer that the 50 ml CZ vial previously discussed for an existing product had received regulatory approval. We expect revenues at peak volumes for this product to be in the range of $45 million per year. On another positive note, at a recent advisory committee meeting it was recommended that a new oncology product received approval which is packaged using a 2 ml CZ vial. Overall, I\u2019m very encouraged by the progress seen during the past few months on both our CZ and device platform programs. As we look at the remainder of 2015, our order book remains strong with a firm backlog of $352 million, a 11% ahead of the same period in 2014 and more than half of which is comprised of high value products. While the second quarter is filling in consistent with our expectation, our visibility looking at the second half of the year is somewhat limited at this point. Sales for the full year will again be driven by high value products for biologics, rise in sales of proprietary devices and sample requirements for ongoing development programs utilizing CZ and SmartDose. Although the underlying organic growth of our business will be healthy, our full year sales and earnings will be subject to the currency headwind from the strong U.S. dollar. For the full year in 2014, the euro dollar exchange rate averaged $1.33 whereas at the outset of 2015 the rate has been as low as $1.05 and is fluctuating in the range of the $1.05 to $1.10. Assuming an exchange rate of $1.08 for the remainder of the year currency translation would be expected to reduce sales by approximately $120 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.23 to $0.25 per share. On that basis, we estimate our 2015 adjusted earnings per share will fall in the range of $1.69 to $1.84. For the longer term, we continue to believe the strong pipeline of biologic drugs and expanded indications for approved molecules will sustain HVB growth in the packaging systems group and present numerous opportunities for our portfolio of devices. As we outlined in the February call, West is in excellent position to capture high value products and device sales for a substantial number of these new products. Indeed, virtually all of the new molecules that will be delivered by injection either recently approved or undergoing Phase III clinical trials in oncology, autoimmune disease, diabetics and infectious disease will utilize high value West for Daikyo packaging system for vial and prefilled syringe format. And with the recent announcement of the FDA advisory panel meeting in June, on June 9th and 10th on the anti-PCSK9 molecules, we expect these products could receive approval in the third quarter. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Federici for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Don, and good morning, every one. We issued our first quarter results this morning reporting first quarter 2015 earnings of $32.9 million were $0.45 per diluted share versus the $038 per diluted share we reported in the first quarter of \u201914. There were no non-GAAP measures affecting earnings in either the current or the prior year first quarter. This quarter's reported 18% increase in diluted EPS was achieved despite the decline in the value of the euro which reduced our reported earnings by $0.08 per share. Turning to sales. Slide seven shows a component of our consolidated sales increase. Consolidated first quarter sales were $335.9 million, an increase of 6.5% over first quarter 2014 sales excluding exchange. Packaging system sales increased 7.7% versus the same quarter of 2014 sales excluding unfavorable exchange. Sales price increases in packaging systems were approximately 1.1 percentage point. The favorable mix of product sold and volume increases contributed the remainder of the sales increase with our high value products increasing 19% versus the prior year first quarter. High value products sales represented 46% of packaging system's Q1 2015 sales. The rise in HVP sales was not unexpected and we believe should be considered in the context of the 7% decline experienced in last year\u2019s comparable first quarter which resulted from late 2013 customer inventory build. Importantly, for the full year of 2015, we expect an 8% to 12% growth in high value products sales versus 2014. In short, although we enjoyed a strong growth, we do not believe our first quarter results represent any change in the long term growth trajectory of our business. Delivery Systems sales increased by 5.8% versus the prior year quarter excluding exchange and the effects of the 2014 sale of a contract tooling and services business. Crystal Zenith and SmartDose product sales were $5.4 million in the current quarter approximately $1.6 million above the Q1 2014 level. Overall, sales of proprietary products were $23 million or 24% of the segment's revenues in the quarter versus 22.5% in the prior year quarter. As provided in our slide eight, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q1 \u201915 was 32.7% versus the 30.7% margin we achieved in the first quarter of \u201914. Packaging systems first quarter gross margin of 39.1% was 3.7 margin points higher than the 35.4 achieved in the first quarter of \u201914. The increase in gross margin is due to price increases, the favorable mix from higher high-value product sales, and higher plant utilization, offset by normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead cost. Delivery systems first quarter gross margin declined by 2.2 margin points to 15.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. The current quarter lower gross margin is primarily due to higher labor cost and increased overhead cost associated with new capability supporting both proprietary and contract manufacturing programs, and relatively lower margin development agreement sales. As reflected on Slide 9, Q1 2015 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $1.2 million versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, first quarter 2015 [sic] SG&A expense was 16.4% versus 16.2% in the first quarter of 2014. Pension cost declined by $500,000 benefitting from the strong returns on plant assets in 2014. Stock-based compensation and incentive cost were $2.2 million higher than a year-ago, primarily as a result of the relative increase in our stock price during the current year's first quarter versus Q1 of 2014. Foreign exchange had a favorable effect reducing SG&A expenses by $2.9 million. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow metric. Operating cash flow was a negative $2 million in the current quarter, $11 million less than the prior-year quarter reflecting the voluntary $20 million pension contribution made in Q1 2015. We will continue to manage our pension plan with the goal of reducing the associated financial risk and operating volatility. Our capital spending was $30.4 million in the current quarter. We expect to spend approximately $145 million to $160 million in capital in 2015. Approximately half of the planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including approximately $25 million for the construction of our Ireland facility. Slide 11 provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be stronger and we're confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at March 31 was $207 million, $48 million less than our December 2014 balance. In addition to the Q1 pension funding; approximately $17 million of the decrease is due to the foreign exchange impact on our overseas cash. A large majority of our cash remained invested overseas and is generally not available to be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring cash consequences. Debt at March 31 was $330.7 million, $6 million less than at year-end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter-end was 11.6%. Working capital totaled $328.5 million at March 31; $78 million lower than at year-end. The majority of the decrease is due to the reclassification to current liabilities of our Series B euro notes which mature in February 2016. Our backlog of committed Packaging Systems orders stands at $352 million at March 2015, a 11% higher than at year-end excluding exchange, and 15% higher than the March 2014 backlog ex-currency. At March 2015, high-value products represent 55% of the total backlog approximately 2% stronger than the March 2014 backlog. Based on our Q1 2015 results, and our analysis of the orders on hand, and the continuing unfavorable currency effects, we have narrowed our full-year 2015 earnings guidance in this morning's release. That guidance is summarized on Slide 12. We've based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.08 per euro. By contrast our previous guidance was translated at $1.15 per euro rates. As a remainder, each $0.01 strengthening of the dollar versus the euro results in approximately $0.01 decrease in full-year forecasted EPS as a result of translation. For Q2, we expect a $0.07 to $0.08 currency translation headwind. In addition, our 2015 guidance excludes any impact from a devaluation of the Venezuela and Bolivar, as the company continues to operate primarily under the official exchange rate and excludes charges associated with our CEO succession. I now like to turn the call back over to Don Morel. Don? Don Morel : Thank you very much, Bill. Finally, before we open the line for your questions, I would like to simply say what an honor has been for me to serve the shareholders, employees, and customers of West these many years. I have a deep-rooted faith in the management team and people of West around the globe and every confidence that the company will continue to prosper under Eric's leadership. And I look forward to being an engaged shareholder for many years to come. We now look forward to answering your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Rafael Tejada with Bank of America. Your line is open. Rafael Tejada : Hi, good morning. And Don, it's been great working with you. Eric, looking forward to building relationship with you as well. A - Don Morel : Thank you, Rafael. Rafael Tejada : Welcome on board. So just a couple of quick ones from me. I guess, I just want to start off with some bigger picture items. Just looking at what's going on, on the generics landscape, further consolidation, is that at all being contemplated in the guidance that's been put out today, or is that at all impacting the way that you are thinking about the business? A - Don Morel : Yes, I mean the guidance was based on the demand pattern we see across all segments of our business. So the information we currently have at hand it's baked in. Rafael Tejada : Okay. And looking at just the Q2 backlog composition, I mean, you're noting strong trends there, very favorable mix in terms of the high-value product mix so -- but is there any change in terms of the burn that you are anticipating and what's baked in into that backlog? A - Don Morel : It will probably happen in the later part of year, Rafael, yes, we don't expect it in the second quarter. As Bill indicated in his remarks, the composition of the backlog is several percentage point higher in terms of the high-value products. The only issue we see is that some of those sales are going to recur in higher tax jurisdiction. So we want those much for the bottom-line if we would like. Rafael Tejada : I see. Okay. And tell me like, in terms of the proprietary products and as it relates to CZ and SmartDose, the comment -- the remarks in the prepared comments were very favorable in terms of that portfolio, so but I still see that the company is expecting about $15 million to $20 million proprietary products. Is there a potential upside of this figure or it's just the nature of the business in terms of being conservative as to how the testing and product evaluation unfolds through the year? A - Don Morel : It's really the later part. As we've talked about before it's the unpredictability of the validation stability and clinical trials for those products. So we're going to continue to see some lumpiness. Yes, there is some upside there may be some downside. We will comment on that quarter-to-quarter as best we see it. All I can say is where I said looking at the plan that we laid out our performance against that plan has been very good, and my expectation is that over that next 12 months to 24 months we will see a ramp up in both CZ activity and SmartDose activity. So we're very encouraged by both development agreements and by the potential for these systems in later stage clinical trials to go commercial. Bill Federici : And Rafael, just one more clarification, remember that these products the customer controls the timing of all of that, whether it be stability testing, the application, the answering the regulators question et cetera in the timing of the launch. So that's what makes it a little bit lumpy and a little bit less predictable. Rafael Tejada : Got it. Okay. And just a couple on the -- just in terms of the P&L and the guidance, the R&D spend was a little bit lighter than what we had baked in into our model. And so I'm just thinking about how is West thinking about the R&D spend for the rest of this year. A - Don Morel : Yes, it\u2019s going to unfold based on customer requirements. Really there is some areas where we can soften up a little bit as we look towards the end of the year. Those are really the far-out program. There may be cost for us to ramp up that spending depending on how we see some of their trials unfolding as their requirement. So I wouldn't read anything into it, other than we had the opportunity to cut a little bit and we'll look at it quarter-by-quarter. Rafael Tejada : Okay. And a couple more just on guidance. Just clarifying, I mean, you maintained the 6% to 8% constant currency guidance, but before you were saying the high-end. So I just want to make sure that nothing there has changed in terms of how you're looking at the business. Bill Federici : No the -- that we have other than currency that's really all the -- all the impact that we see. Everything else remains the same. Rafael Tejada : Okay. And on the bottom line, there is an incremental $0.05 hit from unfavorable effects, and I'm assuming the rest of it is related to the tax rate or is there also an impact from the mix? Bill Federici : It's really the currency. We -- our previous guidance was at $1.15, Rafael, and we gave this guidance at $1.08. Rafael Tejada : Got it. Bill Federici : And again, if you look at that, use that $0.01 to $0.01, $0.01 decrease in the value in euro versus the dollar over a full-year each $0.01 is about worth of penny of EPS. So somewhere between $0.05 and $0.07 is what we have think is the number. For the first quarter of 2014, just as a reminder, we were at actual exchange rate of $1.37 per euro. That same number is what we're expecting for Q2 in terms of what it actually was last year was about $1.37 also. And using that same dollar rate the difference is in the second quarter as we've stated is somewhere between $0.07 and $0.08 of impact of currency. Rafael Tejada : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Well thank you for the questions I'll jump back in queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Hi, good morning. Don, I wish you best of luck as well, and I obviously knew the name, but well respect and I wish you all the best. A - Don Morel : Thank you. Larry Solow : Just on the high-value products, really it was certainly an easy comp. Still you achieved pretty good growth there on the top line. Is the guidance for the full-year, bringing it down to more of the normalized 10% to 12%, is that because you don't have a lot of visibility in the back half, so do you sort of choose to err on the side of conservatism or how do you look at that? A - Don Morel : So I think there was a couple of ways to look at it. The first of which is that we go back and look at trends over the past eight quarters roughly. And if you normalize the quarter-to-quarter numbers what we've seen is that 8% to 12% type of growth in those categories. You may recall from the chart that we show in the Investor Presentation you map that over five years our CAGR assuming that range. And we know that we'll continue to see some lumpiness there simply by our customers, inventory strategies, and by slight changes and demand in the marketplace. The important takeaway is that we believe we will see low-to-mid-double-digit growth in that product category for the foreseeable future and certainly the approval as you look at the biologic pipeline coming through, bodes very well for sustained growth. Larry Solow : And I realize obviously the gross margin, which was a phenomenal number, obviously lifted by the high-value products. Did you guys expect it to be that high or was it even a little bit of a surprise to you how much lift you got from that? A - Don Morel : I think we are little surprised by the total lift. But a large part of that is the analysis of the operating efficiencies which tend to flow through on a quarterly basis. You get a little bit of an indication month-to-month in the financials but it just shows the quality of the job done by our guys in the operating facilities they are just nailing it to the wall. Larry Solow : Absolutely. And does that -- is there a possibility that we can see more benefit in the back half the year though you're not necessarily building in? A - Don Morel : Yes. It's a little difficult to predict, Larry, because as you know we get the seasonality in Q3 with the European plant shutdown and PM that's done in the Americas. And with the pharma guys demand will be a little bit lumpy in the fourth quarter because they're going into the end of the year. So it's our traditional pattern. I wouldn't read anything with that gross margin into flowing through the rest of the year other than solid first quarter and we'll manage the business appropriately going forward. Bill Federici : And Larry, also comps get a little tough as the year goes on, you remember. Larry Solow : Right, absolutely. Just on the PDS side of it, obviously some impact on margins. I think it's mostly high-class type problems with increased development activity and expansion of capacity. Do you expect some of these issues -- it seems like you do expect a little bit of them to subside as the year progresses and the margins come back a little bit, is that fair? A - Don Morel : Yes, again a lumpy picture back to Ralph's question was the timing of orders for things like CZ and SmartDose, as well as the other proprietary products. The issue in the quarter was that we had a fairly large amount of development revenue recognized which does not carry very high margins. As our percentage of propriety products increases you will see the impact of that mitigate. Larry Solow : Got you. Bill Federici : And Larry, we did provide some guidance for the full-year on the margin and you can see that margin is roughly equivalent or slightly higher than last year's margin for us for PDS. Larry Solow : Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. I'm not showing any further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Morel for closing remarks. Don Morel : Thank you very much, operator, and thank you every one for your time this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter results in the latter part of July. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Green, West's Chief Executive Officer. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, John and good morning everyone. Welcome to West's second quarter 2015 earnings call. I'm joined on the call this morning by Bill Federici, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Anderson, our Treasurer and Primary Investor Relations Contact. Today, I will review our second quarter results, full year outlook and share my reflections about the business after three months with West. Bill will then provide a deeper review into the financial performance and full year guidance, then we will open up the call for your questions. Starting with the results on Slide 3. We had a strong second quarter with reported revenues of $359.7 million, excluding a 9.9% currency headwind, sales increased 7.4% driven by demand for high value packaging components and proprietary delivery systems. Adjusted EPS of $0.47 includes $0.09 at adverse currency versus last year and would have grown by nearly 8% over the second quarter of prior year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, second quarter of 2014 EPS set a record for West. Turning to business segment highlights for the quarter on Slide 4. Revenue in the Pharmaceutical Packaging Systems segment grew 8.5% on a constant currency basis, with double-digit growth in Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. We continue to experience strong customer demand for the high value packaging components with sales growth of over 12% led by our newer Envision and NovaPure product lines. In our pharmaceutical delivery systems business, revenue grew 6% excluding currency and taking into account the disposition of a small tooling business in 2014. The segment was led by 9.3% growth in the proprietary delivery systems portfolio, we are just [indiscernible] excited about the prospects for SmartDose and CZ products, but the majority of the growth in this quarter came from the more mature proprietary products drug, the constitution devices and the air safety system. The second quarter and year-to-date results together with our packaging systems backlog of firm orders and improving visibility into the second half adds to our confidence for the remainder of the year. We estimate constant currency sales growth in the range of 7% to 8% and are therefore raising a lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range for the full year by $0.05 to be between $1.74 and $1.84. Bill will take you through some of the additional detail behind these numbers in a few minutes.  To update you on the leadership transition, the past 100 days have gone extremely well. As I mentioned in our April call, I was excited to come to West and I could tell you that my experience thus far has exceeded my expectations. I\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time with Don Morel and our leadership team visiting several West locations, meeting with key customers and partners and engaging with many of you in the investor community. It was time well spent and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work alongside Don up to his retirement date on July 1st. I want to again acknowledge and thank Don for many contributions he had made to West during his long tenure as the CEO. Our current success and future prospects are rooted in the strategies, culture and goodwill created under his leadership.  Looking forward on Slide 5, we are making investments in West's future growth initiatives around high value products for Biologics and proprietary delivery devices utilizing CZ and SmartDose. To support the increasing demand for ultra clean particulate-free components in the near term, we added to a high value product capacity with new dedicated clean room manufacturing in Kingston, North Carolina. We have begun receiving customer approvals for additional high value products from this plant and expect to ship commercial product in the third quarter. In June, we officially broke around for a new plant in Waterford, Ireland. This investment is designated to service our key customers in a global diabetes market, which will address the increasing demand for these critical components. I would like now to turn the call over to Bill Federici for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. We issued our second quarter results this morning reporting net income of $27.8 million or $0.38 per diluted share. Our reported results this quarter include a $0.09 per diluted share one-time charge associated with executive retirements. Excluding this charge, our adjusted earnings per diluted share are $0.47 this quarter, $0.05 below the $0.52 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of '14.  Our 2015 earnings have been adversely impacted by the continued decline in the value of the euro and most other foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. A translation of our international results into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes has reduced our reported earnings by approximately $0.09 per share as compared to the prior year second quarter and by $0.18 per share for the year-to-date June comparison. We manage our foreign currency [indiscernible] exposures and generally our local operations are naturally hedged.  Turning to sales, Slide 6 shows the components of our consolidated sales increased. Excluding exchange effects, our consolidated second quarter sales of $359.7 million increased by 7.4% versus our second quarter 2014 sales. Packaging system sales increased 8.5% versus the same quarter 2014, excluding exchange. Sales price increases accounted for 1.2 percentage points in the sales increase and the favorable mix of product sold and volume increases contributed the remainder of the increase. Sales of our high value products rose 12% versus the prior year second quarter. High value products represented 45.9% of packaging systems Q2 2015 sales versus 44.4% a year ago. We continue to see strong customer demand for our product offerings that need our customers' high quality specification.  Delivery system sales increased by 6% versus the prior year quarter ex-currency and excluding the 2014 divestiture of a contract tooling and services business. Sales of our proprietary products were $29 million or 28.3% of the segments revenue in the quarter versus 27 million or 27.1% in the prior year quarter. The combined Q2 revenues from CZ and SmartDose of $8 million were roughly equal to the combined 2014 Q2 sales. Contract manufacturing sales increased by 4.9% at constant rates, excluding the impact of the tool [sharp] divestiture. As provided on Slide 7, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q2 '15 was 32.8% 8% versus the 33% margin we achieved in the second quarter of 2014.  Packaging systems second quarter gross margin of 38.1% was three-tenth of a margin point higher than the 37.8% achieved in the second quarter of '14. The increase in gross margin is due to price increases, the favorable mix of sales and lower raw material costs offset by normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead costs.  Delivery systems second quarter gross margin declined by one margin point to 19.3%, primarily due to the 2014 divestiture of the tooling operation and higher labor and increased overhead costs associated with new capabilities, supporting both proprietary and contract manufacturing customer programs. As reflected on Slide 8, Q2 2015 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $3.3 million versus the prior year quarter. A favorable exchange effect partially offset increased sales and marketing expense related to our global sales meeting held in Q2 2015, which was last held in 2013 as well as increases in regulatory personnel, cost of standardized processes and information service costs in our packaging systems division as compared to Q2 2014. General corporate costs were $3.2 million above the prior year quarter, due to higher incentive compensation costs, a 2014 medical insurance cost reduction and higher stock-based compensation costs, offset by a decrease in U.S. pension costs. As a percentage of sales, second quarter 2015 SG&A expense was 16.9% versus 15.6% in the second quarter of 2014. Slide 9 shows our key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our year-to-date operating cash flow is $2.6 million above what we generated in the first six months of 2014, despite the negative impact of exchange rates and the higher level of pension funding in 2015. The majority of the $10.9 million executive retiring charge will be settled in stock and is not expected to impact our cash flow.  Our capital spending was $57 million for the first six months of 2015, approximately the same as at this time in 2014. We expect to spend approximately 145 million to 155 million in capital in 2015. Approximately 60% of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including approximately $28 million for the construction of our new Waterford facility. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we are confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at June 30th was $252 million, [$3.3 million] less than our December '14 balance foreign exchange reduced our June 2015 overseas cash balances by approximately $13 million. Debt at June 30th was $326.7 million, 10 million less than at year-end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter-end was 7%. Working capital totaled $366 million at June 30, $40 million lower than at year-end. The majority of the decrease is due to the reclassification to current liabilities of our Series B euro notes, which mature in February of '16.  Looking ahead, our backlog of committed packaging systems order stands at $350 million at June 2015, 8% higher than at year-end excluding exchange. At June 2015, the percentage of high value products in the total backlog is approximately the same as in the 2014 June backlog. Based on our year-to-date 2015 results, our analysis of the orders on hand and the continuing unfavorable currency effects, we have increased the lower end of our full year 2015 earnings guidance in this morning's release.  That guidance is summarized on Slide 10. We've based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.10 per euro versus the $1.08 per euro rate used in our prior guidance. As a remainder, each one penny strengthening of the dollar versus the euro results in approximately a $0.01 decrease in full year forecasted EPS as a result of translation. Going forward, we expect a $0.05 to $0.06 currency translation headwind in Q3 and another $0.03 to $0.04 headwind in Q4. In addition, our 2015 guidance excludes any impact from a devaluation of the Venezuela and Bolivar, as we continue to operate primarily under the official exchange rate and it excludes the charge associated with our executives retirement and related costs. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Bill. In summary, our 7,000 colleagues around the world delivered a solid quarter and a strong first half of 2015. After my first 100 days, I am more firmly convinced that West is well position to benefit from the positive market trends with increased demand for our high value packaging components and proprietary delivery systems. In addition we are investing appropriately to meet the future needs of our customers and deliver increased shareholders value. Thank you. We now look forward to answer your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. First question is from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open. Q : Looking if you guys could just on the strong higher value [indiscernible] sales. I realize it's one quarter that doesn\u2019t necessarily make a trend and I know some of the newer products are coming off of much smaller basis, but I guess nice to see Envision and NovaPure sort of carrying some of the growth load this quarter. Have you any color on that? Larry Solow : Looking if you guys could just on the strong higher value [indiscernible] sales. I realize it's one quarter that doesn\u2019t necessarily make a trend and I know some of the newer products are coming off of much smaller basis, but I guess nice to see Envision and NovaPure sort of carrying some of the growth load this quarter. Have you any color on that? Eric Green : Yes, we are very pleased with the results of our high value products portfolio. It continues to gain traction and acceptance in the market as more of our customers are requiring the higher quality of the end product -- the components with our end products. So we are seeing the demand continues to play well with how West is positioned and also how our operations are being optimized to support these customers in all geographies. Q : And then CZ vials, any update. I know you sort of -- I think you have sighted the two recent approvals, two products I think that we have heard that. Any sort of update, how -- is the development pipeline expanding? Any thoughts on that. Larry Solow : And then CZ vials, any update. I know you sort of -- I think you have sighted the two recent approvals, two products I think that we have heard that. Any sort of update, how -- is the development pipeline expanding? Any thoughts on that. Eric Green : Yes Larry, the pipeline of our CZ program still remain very robust. Right now we have 13 CZ programs in formal stability studies and the outlook continues to be positive. Q : And just back to on the gross margin, in light of some improved visibility and it sounds like packaging systems is doing well. Thoughts on you have your targeted gross margin for the year sort of implies a bit of a contraction in the back half of the year. Is that due to maybe a little slowdown or timing related on some of the higher value products or any other reason for that? Larry Solow : And just back to on the gross margin, in light of some improved visibility and it sounds like packaging systems is doing well. Thoughts on you have your targeted gross margin for the year sort of implies a bit of a contraction in the back half of the year. Is that due to maybe a little slowdown or timing related on some of the higher value products or any other reason for that? Eric Green : Yes Larry, basically it's seasonality as if you look historically that's been the case. We have the summer shutdowns for preventive maintenance for both our shops in -- our factories in Europe as well as customers' and the start up after that we see -- generally, we see that the second half margins being slightly less than the first half. For the full year, I just want to remind you that we are guiding up for margins, both at the gross line and the operating profit line. Q : And then just last, on SG&A, pretty decent rise if you take out the currency, it is about 12%, I know you sighted that the global timing of the sales meeting I guess this year versus last year, is that, if you take that out would SG&A look somewhat better or good? Larry Solow : And then just last, on SG&A, pretty decent rise if you take out the currency, it is about 12%, I know you sighted that the global timing of the sales meeting I guess this year versus last year, is that, if you take that out would SG&A look somewhat better or good? Eric Green : Yes, there is a number of things and you hit on the one that the timing in our global sales meaning which didn\u2019t happen and though it came at all and then there is also in the second quarter of 2014, we actually had a slight reduction in our medical costs premiums due to some experience of adjustments made by the carrier. So we actually got a benefit in the \u201914 second quarter that\u2019s not there this year. And then also on incentive compensation, we\u2019re tracking a little ahead of our goal, so we are taking those comp adjustments that positions up, so those are the three big ones. We\u2019re also adding some heads where we believe it makes a lot of sense in the regulatory space, our customers as the regulators and customers continue to drive towards cleaner product, we have the need for more and more regulatory expertise which is a key differentiator for West in the marketplace. So we will continue to invest in those types of expenses. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Derek Brown of Bank of America. Your line is open. Derek Brown : Could you talk a little bit about capacity utilization and sort of how should we think about CapEx going into 2016? Eric Green : Okay. So capacity utilization is a complicated story, but let me try to simplify, blow it down. On the PPS side in the business, we try to aim for an 85% or so utilization of our plans. However, that\u2019s not a perfect signs and certain of our aspects of the capacity especially in the high value products, especially around envision and especially around washing for Westar, we are very, very tax [ph] at capacity line, we are pushing up against the 100% and that\u2019s why you see our lead times I have been expanding. We are, as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019re putting, we continue to invest very prudently in additional water capacity for Westar as well as a vision systems for envision and we\u2019ll continue as well as clean rooms for high value products but those are the key investments we\u2019re making which we hope in the long-term along with our network optimization programs that we\u2019re working on for the plans, we\u2019ll help elevate some of that strains in the plans. On the PDS side, it\u2019s more on the contract manufacturing specifically. The utilization percentage is not nearly as high, they are in the kind of high-60s, low-70s and that\u2019s appropriate for that kind of business and we feel very comfortable with that right now. Derek Brown : I think we've been surprised to just see how strong the packaging systems business has remained going forward and I would look at it otherwise down two quarters, so I guess when you sort of look at that, is this sort of growth level that you're seeing sustainable in the next year? And then sort of talking about it on the delivery system side, are you expecting to see that business accelerate? Eric Green : Yes Derek, it's a really good point of packaging systems business we continue to see the outlook of the high value products to continue to be very robust. We believe we can continue to perform at similar levels that we have been performing and that's the reason I will add to continue to add capacities within the three main geographies of Asia, Europe and in U.S. Your point is valid and there are delivery devices business where we're looking at future investments that pay backs over the longer term and we're very optimistic with when we are sort of looking at the level engagement we have with the customers active programs with SmartDose, then I mentioned when it was in phase III and then also with the 13 programs with formal stability with the CD product portfolio. So it is, you are going to see it for longer term what the delivery systems business unit around. Derek Brown : I mean, I\u2019ve been watching the stock and filling up for a number of years and certainly see the, always seems to be on the comp I mean is that -- are you less enthusiastic about seeing the avenue were in the past, I'm just curious in terms of your thought on that I mean on that business? Eric Green : Let me start with by saying that the outlook for store remains very strong and there is a timeline for adoption by customers but what we're seeing with conversations with our clients is that the attributes allows them to be more effective in the end markets. So we believe that we have the right formula the customers uptakes are visible, there is more in the formal stability trials at this point so we're pretty optimistic about that and we'll continue to see demand in the CZ portfolio. Derek Brown : And could you talk a little bit just about sort of your longer term vision in terms of international expansion and sort of market shares internationally and what sort of opportunity to add growth? Eric Green : Yes Derek as you know this is an area that we focused on in the past quite a bit and I believe West is well positioned to take advantage of the market opportunities in some of the more in Asia and also in Latin America. I think our position today while we do have presence with the multinational in China and India and other geographies in Asia, we do have the opportunity to see more of an expansion. Now we have had, we put investments in China, India, Singapore, but I believe that our opportunity to growing faster and it present ourselves very nicely for West. So that is an area that we will continue to focus on and put little more energy and resources around that as we go forward. Derek Brown : Can you just remind me in terms of the geographic split of the business, I\u2019m blanking? Bill Federici : It\u2019s rough numbers in Asia took a little under 10%. Derek Brown : Yes, okay. Bill Federici : It\u2019s about $120 million of sales in Asia. Derek Brown : And who your major agent competitors? Bill Federici : Well, It depends obviously if you are talking about in China there are a number of companies that manufacture elastomers for drug product, if you are talking about the local markets there is a wide number, a large number. There are people that work with the multinationals we are the primary, we have market shares that are in similar to our western markets for the multinational, so in that kind of 60% to 70% range. In India it is a mix bag as well, but again we have very solid market shares with the multinationals in India as well. Derek Brown : And so I guess, on your expansion plans is it, do you have to come in the market with lower priced option? Eric Green : I believe there is a great opportunity to bring the West quality to the market where it\u2019s not as prevalent and if you look at the cost of our product in the entire end drug delivery is a small percentage. Therefore to increase the level of quality and the acceptance of the drugs into other local market or the global markets, there is the need to pull more West quality into that system. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. No further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Eric Green for any closing remarks. Eric Green : Thank you, operator. And thank you everyone for your time this morning we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call in October. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Eric Green, West\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, John, and let me welcome you to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. I\u2019d like to start by apologizing for the technical difficulties for those that are dialing in. Today, I\u2019m joined on the call this morning by Bill Federici, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mike Anderson, our Treasurer and primary Investor Relations contact. During our commentary today, Bill and I will review our third quarter results, discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2015 and highlight our long-term business plan. We will then open up the call for your questions. Starting with the results on slide 3, I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter and we are on track to finish the year strong. This is an exciting time at West. Not only are we achieving strong financial results, we\u2019re also executing on our high value product growth strategy and making steady progress on our major drug delivery programs. Let me start with some additional detail on the financials. Third quarter reported revenues of $344.5 million increased 5.2% excluding a significant 8% currency headwind. Similarly, adjusted diluted EPS of $0.44 equaled the 2014 quarter overcoming $0.06 of adverse currency translation and grew 13.6% on a constant currency basis. This is primarily a result of strong sales performance for our high value products. Turning to slide 4 and starting with the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment, sales at constant currency grew at 8.5% on higher than market growth across all regions. Customer demand for high value packaging components continues to be strong led by Westar RS, coated components and distribution of Daikyo products. Envision and NovaPure product lines also had a strong demand in the quarter. This consistent performance reflects the unique value proposition West\u2019s high value components provide for our customers, particularly those focused or facing an increase in stringent regulatory environments.  In fact, we are experiencing robust growth in our backlog of firm customer orders, particularly for Westar RS which we are actively addressing. This underscores the importance of continuing to free up and build capacity for these products in our current and future operations footprint. Sales in pharmaceutical delivery systems segment were comparatively lower due to the sale of a contract services business late in third quarter of last year and a decline in both reconstitution devices and SmartDose sales. We expect the category to recover in Q4. CZ and SmartDose sales continue to be uneven or lumpy because of the inherent nature of drug development. However, these programs are moving in the right direction and we are certainly encouraged by the progress in the quarter. To that point, the development of our SmartDose wearable injector continues to gain momentum in the marketplace with multiple active development programs in place, including a recently submitted application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Amgen\u2019s Repatha. The application is for a 420-mg monthly dose to administer it as a single injection utilizing the SmartDose injector, which features a silicone-free CZ cartridge and a FluroTec-coated piston containment system. We are also aware that another product employing a CZ vial as the primary container has been recently approved by the FDA and this is in addition to the Q2 approval by the FDA of a previously marketed product that we expect to be reintroduced in a CZ vial in 2016. These developments demonstrate the value propositions behind these proprietary technologies, and we expect to build on the momentum. With regard to the plant expansions, we\u2019ve previously reported our Kingston, North Carolina plant is now taking orders from customers for high value products and will serve as a critical additional capacity as we manage the increase in demand for these products. Our expansion in Waterford, Ireland is proceeding to plan. As a reminder, Phase One is designed to increase capacity for our proprietary rubber sheeting, which is used in insulin pen packaging. The plant is expected to be commercial production in early 2018. In addition, we are increasing our capacity in Dublin to service the increase in demand for our contract manufacturing capabilities for the diabetes market. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year on slide 5, we estimate 2015 sales at constant currency to grow at a low end of the 7% to 8% range. We expect a favorable product mix from stronger demand and throughput for our high value products, which will drive margin expansion. Therefore we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range for the full year to be between $1.79 and $1.84 which represents a 15% to 19% growth on a constant currency basis over our results in 2014. On our last call I stated that I would update you on our five-year plan. Our plan is based on the same strategic imperatives that underline our success. It focuses on delivering high quality primary packaging and proprietary delivery systems for injectable medicines. Those markets are growing and in broad terms present the best opportunities for continued growth. We will continue to focus on our core strategic objectives while servicing our key market segments, among them biologics, generics and branded pharma to drive demand for our high value products and proprietary delivery systems. We will grow by being responsive to the different needs within each segment knowing that their particular priorities differ in important ways and delivering the right products in the right way to each. While our current long-term outlook is entirely organic based, we will remain open to opportunities to augment our growth through partnerships and bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our packaging container and delivery system offerings. Finally, we will accelerate efforts throughout our global supply chain to drive operational excellence by aligning capabilities to support key end markets and optimizing the utilization of our existing asset base as well as new investments. In doing so, we believe we can improve service, quality and profitability. As a result, we expect we can attain fiscal year 2020 sales of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, operating margins in the range of 19% to 23%. Organic growth will continue to be driven by our proprietary technologies, which consist of high value packaging components and delivery systems, and by geographic expansion. Margin growth will be fueled by supply chain enhancements and product mix. I would like now to turn the call over to Bill Federici for a more detailed discussion on our financial results. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We issued our third quarter results this morning reporting net income of $1.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Our reported results this quarter include a $0.42 one-time non-cash charge associated with the settlement of approximately 40% of our U.S. pension obligation. Excluding this charge, our adjusted earnings per diluted share are $0.44 this quarter, equal to our adjusted third quarter 2014 earnings per diluted share. Our 2015 earnings have been adversely impacted by the decline in the value of the euro and other currencies versus the U.S. dollar. The translation of our international results into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes has reduced our reported earnings by approximately $0.06 per share as compared to the prior year third quarter and by $0.24 per share through nine months. Turning to sales, slide 7 shows the major components of our consolidated sales increase. Excluding $30 million of exchange effects, our consolidated third quarter sales increased by 5.2% versus our third quarter 2014 sales. Excluding currency, packaging system sales increased 8.5% versus the same quarter 2014. Sales price increases accounted for 1.7 percentage points of the increase and the favorable mix of products sold and volume contributed the remainder of the increase. Sales of our high value products rose 14% versus the prior year third quarter. HVP sales represent 45.9% of packaging systems Q3 2015 sales versus 43.8% a year ago. We continue to see strong demand for our product offerings that meet our customers\u2019 high quality expectations.  Delivery systems net sales decreased by 2.6% versus the prior year quarter ex-currency. Sales of our proprietary products were $22.5 million or 22.4% of the segment\u2019s revenues in the quarter versus $28.4 million or 27.5% in the prior year quarter. The majority of the decrease in proprietary sales occurred in our reconstitution products following strong second quarter 2015 sales for those products. CZ and SmartDose were a combined $7.5 million in the current quarter, approximately $1 million less than the combined Q3 2014 sales of those products. Contract manufacturing sales increased by 4% at constant exchange rates. As provided on slide 8, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q3 2015 was 31.4% versus the 30.9% margin we achieved in the third quarter of 2014. Packaging systems third quarter gross margin of 37% is 1.7 margin points higher than the 35.3% achieved in Q3 2014. The increase in gross margin is due to continuing favorable sales mix, modest price increases and lower raw material costs, offset by normal inflationary increases in labor costs and volume related increases in overhead costs. Delivery systems third quarter gross margin declined by 3 margin points to 17.3%, primarily due to the weaker product mix of sales and increased overhead costs associated with new capacity. As reflected on slide 9, Q3 2015 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $1.4 million versus the prior year quarter. Our favorable exchange effect offset higher incentive comp expense and merit increases. As a percentage of sales, third quarter 2015 SG&A expense was 15.8% versus 15.7% in Q3 2014. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our year-to-date operating cash flow is $7.5 million higher than the first nine months of 2014, despite the negative impact of exchange rates and the higher level of pension funding in 2015. Our year-to-date results include non-cash charges of $10.9 million in Q2 for executive retirement and the $49 million pension settlement charge in the third quarter. We have made a $15 million voluntary contribution to the pension plan in Q4 in order to restore the asset funding level of the plan to what it was before the annuity purchase. Our capital spending was $86.8 million for the first nine months of 2015, approximately the same as in the prior year period. We expect to spend approximately $145 million to $155 million in capital in 2015 and approximately 50% of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion activities, including approximately $26 million for the construction of our new Waterford facility. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we\u2019re confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at September 30 was $256.8 million, $1.5 million more than our December 2014 balance. Foreign exchange reduced our September 2015 overseas cash balances by approximately $17 million. Debt at September 30 was $302.5 million, $34 million less than at year end. Our net debt-to-total-invested capital ratio at quarter end was 4.4%. Working capital at September 30 totaled $381 million, roughly $26 million lower than at year end. The majority of the decrease is due to the reclassification to current liability of our euro notes which mature in February of 2016. Looking ahead, our current backlog of committed packaging systems orders stands at $397 million, 23% higher than at the prior year end excluding exchange. In addition to new business, our backlog growth includes an increase in longer dated orders due to the longer lead times we are experiencing for high value products in one of our facilities. Many of those orders are scheduled for 2016 delivery. Excluding the impact of those advance orders, we estimate that our backlog would have increased 10% to 15% versus the prior year end. We expect our order backlog will decrease as a result of the actions we have taken, increased throughput in that facility and as customers validate recently added HVP capacity. Based on our year-to-date 2015 results and our analysis of the orders on hand and the continuing unfavorable currency effects, we have raised the lower end of our full-year 2015 earnings guidance in this morning\u2019s release. That guidance is summarized on slide 5. We have based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, the same assumption we used in our prior guidance. As a reminder, each $0.01 strengthening of the dollar versus the euro results in approximately a $0.01 decrease in full year forecasted EPS as a result of translation. Going forward, we expect a $0.03 to $0.04 currency translation headwind in quarter four. In addition, our 2015 guidance excludes any impact from a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, as we continue to operate primarily under the official exchange rate that excludes executive retirement and pension settlement charges. Also in Q4, we intend to repatriate approximately $128 million of cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. We do not expect to incur any additional tax costs associated with this repatriation. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you very much, Bill. In summary, we had a great quarter. I\u2019m very pleased with our continued strong execution of the high value product strategy and our steady progress with key drug delivery development programs.  This concludes our prepared remarks for today, and now we look forward to answering your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Hi. Good morning, guys. Eric Green : Good morning, Larry. Larry Solow : Just maybe starting from the 2020 goals and then working my way back to just a couple of current questions, when you look out at those goals, I don\u2019t know if you want to give any more color on the difference between PPS and PDS, but how do you look at PPS in particular? Do you look at particular categories like the PD-1 inhibitor category for instance is one, and multiple categories? Or do you do it more as a top down looking, just like sort of get how you get your growth rates and assumptions? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, good morning and great question. So, we actually went through a pretty detailed process over the last three months and it\u2019s one of the actions that I wanted to take as I stepped into the role here at West. And we pulled in a number of our colleagues around the world, different disciplines, different expertise in the industry. And the process we used was I want to refer to as a bottoms-up approach. We took a look at the end markets. We took a look at where it\u2019s attractive to play such as we mentioned earlier about the biologics, the branded pharma, the generic space. And we have identified that our portfolio and the high value products portfolio plays very nicely on the trend of the marketplaces. So when we pulled these numbers together to represent and present to you today, we did take a look at what we currently have, the pipelines and also where the market\u2019s going and took advantage of that opportunity. Now, I\u2019ll turn it to Bill to talk a little bit about how do we got to the $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, because there is a currency impact when you look at prior year guidance. Bill Federici : Yes, thank you, Eric. And as Eric mentioned, when we looked at our long-term plans last year, the value of the euro was a lot higher. It was $1.25 per euro, whereas now we\u2019re using an assumption of $1.10. Larry Solow : Right. Bill Federici : That on order of magnitude was about $175 million worth of sales difference in and of itself. In terms of the makeup, the other part of your question about what is included, just as a reminder, of the top 35 biologics by IMS data, we or Daikyo components are on each of those top 35. Larry Solow : Right. So, again, the theme, it doesn\u2019t matter who wins. I guess you guys will participate. And as you look back, ex-currency, changes in currency, do you feel that your 2019 goals are, as you\u2019re now a year later, are you running relatively close to those plus or minus? Bill Federici : Yes. Yes, absolutely. They\u2019re still in line with those ranges we gave. Larry Solow : Okay. And then just coming in a little closer to your guidance for next year, just on your top line, your 6% to 8%, do you expect that to be carried more by PPS, and would maybe PDS at least slow down, at least the SmartDose portion of that slow down perhaps in the first half of the year as some of the later stage trials - obviously the one with Amgen has stopped, and I guess you won\u2019t - you\u2019ll get maybe some commercial sales in the back half of the year, but how you look at sort of the PPS versus PDS, are you ready to give any more color on that? Eric Green : Yes. Larry, when you look at the high-value products portfolio and the continued growth that we\u2019ve seen in strong double digits this year, we believe that will carry into 2016. When it comes to the proprietary technologies around SmartDose and CZ, while we believe that there\u2019s attractive growth in that area, and in fact we\u2019re looking at about a 50% growth on that portfolio, but, again, that\u2019s a small piece of our entire business at this point. With the recent announcement with Amgen, and it was discussed on their call last night, we\u2019re in a good position with, when we talk about the wearable injector being part with Repatha going forward, but it\u2019s too premature to start talking about volumes and revenues at this point. Larry Solow : Okay. And just a couple more quickly, the longer lead times and the PPS backlog of 23%, is it - have you requested that for your customers? Is it because there is a high-class problem? I mean, is demand accelerating to the point where you need to do this? Is there production issues that you have come into and that\u2019s why you\u2019re expanding capacity? Or is it really just a high-class demand problem that will work itself through? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, it\u2019s a good question, and the way you phrased that, high-class problem, is a good way to describe it. We\u2019ve had an increase in demand a little greater than we anticipated when it comes to specifically around the Westar RS portfolio, which is primarily driven out of one plant where the backlog started to increase, and that\u2019s our Jersey Shore facility in Northern Pennsylvania. Now, what we have done is obviously we\u2019re in direct communication with our customers on a constant basis, but what we have done is we\u2019ve employed strong lean manufacturing principles at that site, and we\u2019ve already seen significant benefits on throughput in the last several weeks in our facility. So, we believe this is an issue driven by customer demand that we\u2019re able to contain and to work through over the next number of months. Now, I do want to comment that in addition to improving the productivity of our Jersey Shore facility, the Kingston, North Carolina investment that we\u2019ve made is coming online right now with validation with customers so we can alleviate some of that bottleneck through our new facility in North Carolina. So it\u2019s - we\u2019re managing through this. We believe we have our hands firmly around this situation. We\u2019re working with our customers. And we believe we will continue to be able to support the growth that we\u2019re seeing with that portfolio. Larry Solow : Okay, and just lastly, what - do you have what your thoughts on the - with the pension settlement, what the impact will be on a go-forward basis on the P&L? Bill Federici : Sure, Larry. The pension expense will go up a little bit versus the current year, approximately $2 million. And, again, that depends on what happens with discount rates. Larry Solow : That\u2019s right, right. Bill Federici : And the reason that it\u2019s counterintuitive is that you have - the way pension accounting works you\u2019ve had a whole bunch of unamortized losses in the past that have been accumulated on the balance sheet. So that charge that you see is basically the acceleration of some of that unamortized loss. It\u2019s a noncash charge, and you set that aside. So going forward, though, you\u2019ve used assets to pay for that, for the annuity purchase Larry Solow : Right. Bill Federici : And therefore, earning the rate of return in the assumptions that are used by the actuaries to set the pension expense. And there\u2019s a rate arbitrage there between the rate that you\u2019re earning, which is roughly rough order of magnitude 7% versus the discount rate, which is 4.5%. So that difference you\u2019re losing on all of those assets. So going forward your pension expense increases a little bit. Larry Solow : Got it, but\u2026 Bill Federici : The reason - go ahead, Larry. Larry Solow : No, I was just going to say, it\u2019s essentially a small price to pay for - you reduce your volatility on almost half of your pension. So in terms of - Bill Federici : And we reduce the amount of PBGC premiums from the fact that we have 1,700 less retirees in the plan. Larry Solow : Got it. Great, thanks. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate it. Bill Federici : Thank you, Larry. Eric Green : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Hey, good morning, everyone. Bill Federici : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : So, looking at your 2020 target, and just sort of like a question, so I\u2019m going back, I\u2019m looking at my model, I\u2019m looking at some of the other forecasts you\u2019ve made. And when I just sort of go back and look at your 2012 commentary for your Analyst Day and your 2014, in 2012 you were targeting $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for 2016. It looks like where your guidance is sitting is somewhere around $1.5 billion, or a couple of hundred million dollars short, realizing about $100 million of that is FX.  Same thing when I look at the 2017 numbers. You were targeting somewhere in the $1.8 billion to $2 billion, also about $100 million light from the light end. So I\u2019m just - I\u2019m just once again just trying to get from you what\u2019s your confidence in that number to hit? Because the way I\u2019m looking at it you\u2019ve got to basically do mid-to-high single-digit growth in PPS and then mid-to high-teens growth in the delivery systems business to sort of even get anywhere near the low end of your range. And given that things always seem to take a little bit longer with your business to mature for people to update products, I\u2019m just wondering why you\u2019re so confident in the numbers? Bill Federici : So, let me take the first part of it, Derik. The one thing you have to remember, and we talked about it with Larry, is that there\u2019s a very large currency difference assumption in those models, whether you look at the prior year or prior years before that. We were operating in a much different currency environment versus the U.S. dollar. So they were - one year it was $1.33, another was $1.25. So the - this year, if you just want to use the 2019 numbers we predicted last year versus this year, the currency impact alone is $175 million. Derik De Bruin : Okay. Bill Federici : So your $100 million change is really not significant when you take the currency impact out from those years. Derik De Bruin : Okay. Bill Federici : In terms of our confidence, I\u2019ll let Eric speak to the confidence. Eric Green : Yes, it\u2019s Erik, and just to reiterate, and we spent a tremendous amount of time looking into the details about the markets and where we currently are and what are the expectations going forward. We are focused on the more attractive markets that are growing in the double-digits. And so, our belief on the high-value products portfolio is that we\u2019ll continue to be able to service our customers globally to be able to continue with that market trend. In addition, if you look at some of the geographic presence that we currently have today, it gives us another lever to continue to drive additional growth to West. It\u2019s particularly around the - what we call the PPS business today.  When you turn your attention towards more the PDS, the proprietary around CZ and SmartDose, those are really in smaller phases today. But we\u2019re seeing strong signals of acceptance and then the pipeline of going forward. There could be some timing issues as we look over the next short term, i.e., one or two years. But the responses we\u2019re getting from customers give us confidence that we do have the right value proposition with those new innovations and technologies. So that really focuses on the top line.  When you look at the margin expansion, Derik, there\u2019s two levers that we have. Obviously price, let\u2019s put aside price at this point when we look at the operational excellence capabilities we have at West today. We do have 28 manufacturing sites around the world. We do have the ability to leverage and start utilizing our existing assets a little differently than we\u2019ve had historically. So, I think there\u2019s an opportunity that clearly has been vetted on the margin expansion going forward. Derik De Bruin : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. So just as it stands today the impacts to FX in 2016, I mean, you\u2019re talking 6% to 8% constant currency growth, so is it - I\u2019m looking about - where my calculations somewhere would be around a 1% to 2% FX headwind on the top line for next year, as well, where we\u2019re standing? Bill Federici : We haven\u2019t done that math, Derik, but that doesn\u2019t sound unreasonable. Derik De Bruin : Okay. So, you\u2019re repatriating cash, any particular plans for that? Bill Federici : Yes, sure. We mentioned two things, Derik. The first one was that in February of 2016 we have our Series B euro notes, rough order of magnitude $70 million, mature. And the second thing is that we have looked at this build that we have in Ireland, and we have a significant amount of CapEx that we\u2019re going to be going through. So, we look at those, at the cash to be able to help those as well as other general corporate uses. Derik De Bruin : Great. So there is obviously a lot of stuff on the tape on consolidation. Obviously there\u2019s the Pfizer/Allergan news that\u2019s out, and some of the other companies are having some troubles in the news. I guess how does the sort of the consolidation environment, the changes there, does that have any impact on sort of how your outlook is thinking? I mean, could there be some sort of downturn in or changes in some of your packaging contracts with some of these players? Eric Green : Derik, when we look at the outlook of the impact of potential for the consolidation in the industry, for us at West it\u2019s a minimal impact because many of our products are already in the commercial phase and therefore whether it\u2019s two firms or one firm coming together we are able to continue to supply and capture those revenues going forward. I think where you see a little bit of potential delay is in the development arena when the two companies do consolidate, which could push out a couple of projects a little bit longer than we would anticipate. But overall if you look at our business it\u2019s very low impact for West. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thanks. Bill Federici : Thank you Derik. Eric Green : Thank you Derik. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open. Dave Windley : Hi. Good morning gentleman. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to get a little bit of insight into the sales progress for proprietary delivery products or devices that are not SmartDose and CZ, so reconstitution systems and things like that, the old Medimop and some of the other smaller things that you had acquired into that business a while back. Eric Green : Great. Bill Federici : Yes, Dave, thank you. And they - we talked about the quarter being slightly down for those products. Medimop was slightly lower. We do expect that category, as Eric mentioned in his commentary, to rebound in Q4. We see strong growth coming out of those proprietary products. Going forward beyond, we do see lots of opportunities for the Medimop reconstitution products and expect that that will continue to grow for us as we go forward. Just as with all of these proprietary device products, there is very small bases, Dave. So even Medimop, which has relatively been in the market for a long time, is still only a $50 million a year product line for us. Safety, which is the other commercialized proprietary product portfolio, is running around $20 million this year. So they\u2019re small. They will continue to grow nicely. We believe that that strategy, these are products that are needed by our customers, who continue to work on development with us in those arenas. And we don\u2019t expect these to be a major contributor to the kind of growth in delivery systems that we see for SmartDose and CZ, but we do see them as being nice contributors and nice growers going forward. Dave Windley : Thank you for that. And maybe sticking with that topic and moving out to the long-term planning, when you think about your PDS revenue contribution to your 2020 targets, what would you anticipate the mix of those proprietary devices, what percentage of the PDS sales will proprietary comprise by that point? Bill Federici : Again, thanks, Dave. We have been talking in the past about it getting to a point - right now it\u2019s about 75/25, 75% contract manufacturing, 25% proprietary. We\u2019ve been talking for years about getting towards that 50/50 milestone of mix proprietary versus contract manufacturing, and we still see that as being our guidepost for this 2020. Now, all that being said, we have, as you see in the release and in Eric\u2019s comments, put a $200 million revenue range in the plan. And, to be honest, that\u2019s - a lot of that is due to the fact that we do not control the timing of our customers\u2019 development and commercialization of CZ and SmartDose. So, we cannot put a single stake in the ground for you, but I can tell you that we still have high confidence that we will be marching consistently towards that 50/50 milestone that we\u2019ve set for ourselves. Dave Windley : And so not to - I guess I\u2019m just thinking a little along the lines of Derik\u2019s questions about we\u2019ve - 50/50 is what you\u2019ve said in the past. You\u2019re saying that again today. We\u2019ve kind of rolled forward one more year on the long-term planning. Should I attribute the fact that you\u2019re not seeing, say, that number in 2020 being further than you might have seen it in 2019 just a matter of difficulty in sticking a flag in the ground type of thing and the uncertainty around this over that time period? Bill Federici : Absolutely. Absolutely, that\u2019s exactly the way I would think about it. Dave Windley : Okay. Is it possible to give for the two segments some type of - I\u2019m hesitant to ask you to be too specific on this, because I\u2019m guessing you probably won\u2019t be - but some type of sense of margin differential between, as it stands today, between high-value products and standard in packaging and proprietary and contract manufacturing in delivery? Bill Federici : Absolutely, can do that for you, Dave, easy. So, it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past. High-value products are running gross margin over the last five years about 55% versus standard packaging, which is around just under 30%. And those are not exact, but those are good mileposts for you going forward. On the delivery systems side, contract manufacturing, we are slightly less than 20% on a contract manufacturing gross margin basis, whereas with proprietary today we\u2019re not that much better. We\u2019re probably in the high 20s, low 30s, but that\u2019s really volume related, not pushing - not having as much throughput through those plants on a very lumpy, as we said, basis for those products. When we go out further in the plan we see our margins getting into, for those types of products, for the proprietary delivery system products, being in the high 30s. In fact, some of them, like Medimop, are 49% already as they\u2019re commercialized, but from the high 30s into - up to 50% gross margin. Dave Windley : Okay. And my last question and I\u2019ll drop off, I apologize, Eric, so I was reading through the press release and I have been unable to find the reference, but I thought there was a reference, it kind of sounded like changes in the global infrastructure of the business over the long-term planning period that would allow for greater efficiency, et cetera. And I know in a previous conversation you and I had talked a little bit about that. I wondered if you could flesh that out a little bit for me. Eric Green : Yes, Dave, no, when we look at our global operations, and one of the areas that we\u2019re looking at is to implement more around lean manufacturing capabilities, because we do have tremendous assets on the ground today, and that has been one of the main reasons why West has been very successful. They refer to the moat around the business, right? And so we will continue to leverage the assets on a global basis. And we do believe through lean manufacturing and continuing the direction around network optimization, which we\u2019ve discussed in the past, are levers that we will continue to pull aggressively to make sure that we are expanding our margins beyond just price and product mix. Dave Windley : Okay. So that sounds a little more direct-cost oriented. I guess I was thinking that you had an eye toward doing some things around perhaps global or regional SG&A support operations and things like that. Am I misreading, misremembering? Eric Green : No, Dave, I think there\u2019s a couple of areas that we have is we are starting to use the nomenclature of centers of excellence around our key product portfolios, like high-value products, for example. We\u2019re focusing in the future around three locations Singapore; Waterford, Ireland; and Kingston, North Carolina as the primary locations of centers of excellence. I think secondly is we do currently have regional infrastructure in Asia, Europe, and obviously here in the U.S., and we\u2019re looking at how can we reinforce particularly markets where the attractiveness of growth is ahead of us, so, i.e., China. We have presence there, but how do we reinforce that and continue to have the strong double digits that we\u2019ve been seeing this year? Also India we have a very strong presence. You go down to South America, Brazil, we have a pretty strong presence there in addition. So those are the areas that we\u2019ll reinforce to make sure that we have the capabilities in the regions to be able to service the customers locally and to respond to their needs on a local basis. Dave Windley : Okay. Thank you. Eric Green : Thanks, Dave. Bill Federici : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green for any further remarks. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for your time today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call in February. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode to reduce background noise, but later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your first speaker for today, Quintin Lai, Head of Investor Relations. You have the floor sir. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to West\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 conference call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors Section on the company\u2019s website located at www.westpharma.com. This morning, CEO, Eric Green and CFO, Bill Federici will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, will provide an update on our business and recent organizational realignment and will provide a financial outlook and expectations for the full year 2016. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today\u2019s conference call and a copy of that presentation is also available on the Investors section of our website.  On slide 2 is the Safe Harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the presentation will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Federal Securities Law and that are based on management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts. Many of the factors that will determine the company\u2019s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. These statements are subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties, and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. For a non-exclusive list of factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to today\u2019s press release as well as any further disclosures the company makes on related subjects in the Company\u2019s 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. In addition, during today\u2019s call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures including sales at constant currency, adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results were prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning\u2019s earnings release. I now turn over the call to West\u2019s CEO and President Eric Green. Eric Green : Great, thank you Quintin and good morning everyone. As you saw in this morning's press release we delivered another solid quarter with overall growth in net sales at constant currency of 9.7%. This reflects strength across the entire company both business units and all geographic regions contributed. In our Packaging Systems business sales grew nearly 10% constant currency; our high value product portfolio delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. As anticipated, we continued to experience strong demand from our customers for the higher performance FluroTec products ready-to-sterilize and ready-to-use Westar product, we also experienced strong demand with Envision, in our industry leading NovaPure offering that ensure the highest standards of quality. In Delivery Systems, sales grew above 9% at constant currency versus the prior quarter and delivering sequential growth as we expected over third quarter of 2015. The growth was driven by demand for diabetes care products including components for insulin pen and glucose monitoring devices. Growth in high-value products and volume driven efficiencies produced 190 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. The related increase in gross profits more than offset $8 million of currency headwinds. This led to Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.47, which was in line with our expectations despite a $0.05 currency headwind. Excluding currency impact, earnings per share would have grown by 16% year over year. The solid fourth quarter capped a successful full-year 2015 as highlighted on slide 4 resulting in net sales of $1.4 billion in constant currency sales growth of 7.2%. For the year, we generated adjusted diluted EPS of $1.83, which was in the upper end of the most recent guidance range. This was despite a $0.29 headwind for currency. Excluding that impact we would have grown adjusted diluted EPS by 19% over 2014. On slide five, showing off a [ph] history of success and the strong foundation. In the fourth quarter, we reformulated our long-term strategy to become the world leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicine. In order to achieve that I believe that we need to be more market focused. And at the start of this year, we realigned our company with that in mind. We formed three functional groups commercial, global operations, and innovation and technology. And each one will focus on customer experience, operational excellence and product service differentiation. We have historically managed through two segments each having regional business units. As shown on slide 6, the commercial customer facing organization is transitioning to focus on three major market segments globally pharma, biologics, and generics. While all three segments are involved in the injectable therapy space, they each have different challenges and needs. We believe we can more effectively deliver a broad proprietary product portfolio by focusing on this particular need in each market from standard to high-value products, delivery devices and our industry-leading contract manufacturing. West is in a unique position to address these market needs with tailored products and service offerings. Turning to slide 7, the chart provides our relative net sales by category in 2015. Going forward, we are combining our packaging components sales with proprietary devices including reconstitution into the safety system CZ and self-injection devices like SmartDose to form the proprietary product business segment. The proprietary products represent just under 80% of our sales in 2015. Sales and marketing responsibility resides with the new commercial organization. And our industry-leading contract manufacturing segment which represents just under 20% of overall sales, will become a new standalone reportable business segment, also under the leadership of the commercial organization. Critical to our long term strategy is the improved coordination in our global operations and supply chain as noted in slide eight. To that end, we are combining management of our global capacity in the newly formed global operations organization. With favorable macro trends for injectable therapy, the demand for our products and services we have expanded and will continue to add to our capacity and capability. In 2016, we expect to invest between 10% to 12% of sales in capital expenditures. Projects range from the ongoing construction of our new center of excellence in Waterford, Ireland through further expansion of high value component capacity in Kinston, North Carolina and in Singapore. We are convinced that increase in our focus on operational efficiency and excellence will improve productivity, operating leverage and profitability at our sites around the world. In conjunction with the overall organizational changes, we are optimizing our existing capacity and leveraging our talented workforce. This past week, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring program that will result in a modest reduction in force as we streamline our operations and investments in commercial activities and technology that will drive growth for the future. Bill will provide more details on the program in a few minutes. Turning to slide nine, we're continuing to invest in the development of new products and services. Building on the success of our R&D efforts, the newly formed innovation and technology organization will focus on product design and development to push leading edge applications to contain, administer and deliver injectable therapies. These include quality enhancements such as the NovaPure 1 and 3 ml syringe plungers, delivery platform including follow-on generation of the SmartDose wearable injector and new applications of Daikyo Crystal Zenith technology. We continue to see a high level of interest in our technology platforms as highlighted in last week\u2019s announcement that a major biotech customer is using Daikyo CZ vials and West\u2019s Flurotec stoppers for its new oncology drug.  Before I hand it over to Bill, I want to conclude by saying that West\u2019s outlook is very bright. The fundamental long-term trends remain favorable. We can grow profitably by continuing to meet the unique needs of our customers and managing our quality and cost. We have a talented workforce that is over 7,000 strong that is focused on quality, safety and the needs of our customers. As we look at 2016, on slide 10, we are reaffirming constant currency sales growth guidance of 6% to 8%. We expect that high value products will lead the way with high single to low double digit growth. Today we provided further 2015 guidance. Adding that, we expect adjusted EPS of between $2.10 to $2.25 representing 15% to 23% growth over 2015. We will continue to benefit from an improving sales mix and operating efficiency. Now, I turnover to Bill Federici, our CFO. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We issued our fourth quarter results this morning. Excluding the effects of special items from both periods, fourth quarter 2015 earnings were $0.47 per diluted share versus the $0.45 we earned in Q4 2014. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided on slides 17, 18 and 19. Turning to sales, slide 12 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. All references to sales amounts are to constant currency. Consolidated fourth quarter sales was $359.7 million, an increase of 9.7% over fourth quarter 2014 sales. Packaging Systems sales increased by $24.3 million or 9.8% over the same quarter 2014. Our favorable sales mix and volume growth accounted for 7.8 percentage points of the increase. Modestly higher selling prices in Packaging Systems contributed the remainder of the increase. High value product sales increased 13.5% versus the prior-year quarter. For the full-year 2015, high value product sales increased 14.8% versus 2014.  Delivery system sales increased $9.5 million or 9.2% over sales in the prior-year quarter. The sales increase was driven by our contact manufacturing business. Fourth quarter sales of proprietary products decreased by $1.6 million and were 23.7% of the segment\u2019s revenues in the quarter. CZ sales and development activity were approximately $3.7 million and SmartDose sample sales were $1.9 million in Q4. On a full-year basis, total 2015 proprietary product sales declined by $2.5 million versus 2014 and represent 24.7% of delivery system segment sales.  As provided on slide 13, our Q4 2015 consolidated gross profit margin was 33.3% versus the 31.4% margin we achieved in the fourth quarter of \u201814. Packaging Systems fourth quarter gross margin of 38.5% is 2.3 margin points higher than the 36.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of \u201814. The favorable mix and volume of products sold, modest sales price increases, and continued savings and plant efficiencies more than offset the impact of higher general inflationary costs. Delivery systems fourth quarter gross margin of 21.1% was 1.5 margin points higher than the prior-year quarter. The higher margin was mainly due to a favorable sales mix and greater capacity utilization and contract manufacturing versus the prior-year quarter. As reflected on slide 14, Q4 2015 [ph] consolidated SG&A expense increased by $3.6 million compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase was due primarily to higher estimated achievement levels on incentive comp program and annual merit increases. As a percentage of sales, Q4 2015 SG&A expense was 0.6 percentage point more than the prior-year period.  Slide 15 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $202 million for the full year of 2015, $30 million more than 2014 due primarily to our strong operating results and lower working capital requirement. Capital additions of roughly $131 million were made in 2015. Roughly half of the capital spend was on new products and expansion efforts including approximately $27 million in Waterford.  We expect capital additions of between $150 million and $175 million in 2016, including approximately $60 million of costs associated with the New Ireland facility.  Slide 15 also provides the summary of balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we are confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at year-end was $275 million, $20 million higher than our December \u201914 balance. Roughly half of the cash is invested overseas and is generally not available for repatriation without tax consequences. However, we repatriated $120 million of overseas cash during the second half of 2015.  Debt at year-end was $298 million, $37 million than at the prior-year end. Our net debt-to-total-invested capital ratio at year-end was 2.3%, a significant improvement from the prior-year end ratio of 7.7%. Working capital totaled $359 million at year-end, $47 million less than the prior-year end. Our higher cash balances were partially offset by the reclassification to short-term of our $7 million euro note B debt maturing later this month.  Our backlog of committed PPS orders remain strong at $413 million as of December \u201915, which is approximately 29% higher than our December \u201914 balances, excluding exchange. Demand-driven extended lead-times for certain high-value products continue to result in advanced customer orders, which inflate our backlog. We expect actions taken, increased capacity and throughput will reduce those lead-times and relieve the backlog in the third quarter of 2016. We have issued our full year 2016 guidance in this morning\u2019s release. The guidance is summarized on slide 16. Our guidance is based on an exchange rate of $1.12 per euro. Our actual 2015 results are translated at $1.11 per euro rate. While exchange rates will continue to be a headwind throughout 2016, we expect the euro headwind will be less than the 15% devaluation experienced during 2015. However, currency volatility is high and Asian and emerging markets\u2019 currencies are creating added headwinds to the business in 2016.  We expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5% versus the 27% ETR we experienced in 2015. Our tax rate is highly dependent on a geographic mix of earnings, which is driven by sales of high value products as we\u2019re migrating toward higher tax jurisdictions like the US, which has an adverse effect on our tax rate. Our guidance includes a $0.02 EPS benefit, resulting from our previously announced 700,000 share repurchase plan, which is intended to maintain a mutual share count. We expect a strong start to 2016 with Q1 EPS growth of between 8% and 15% versus the prior year quarter. We expect to deliver on our full-year earnings guidance of $2.10 to $2.25 per diluted share, which on a constant currency basis, represents an increase of between 15% and 23% in diluted EPS over 2015. That guidance excludes the 2016 restructuring plan charge we announced this morning, which will result in a reduction of course of approximately 1% to 2% of global employees to meet our new market focused commercial organization.  The restructuring charge is expected to range from $23 million to $28 million and will be recognized over the next 12 to 24 months. We expect 2016\u2019s savings of $4 million to $6 million, which is included in our 2016 guidance. Annual savings of $8 million to $10 million are expected as a result of the restructuring. Furthermore, beginning in 2016, we will realign our external reporting to reflect our new organization.  Our two external reporting segments will be proprietary products and contract manufacturing products. We will also provide sales data on our three key market groups, Biologics, Generics and Pharma. We expect that in advance of our Q1 earnings call, we will provide a historical results bridge from our previous reporting segment to our new reporting segment. At that same time, we expect to provide a guidance bridge between old and new reporting segments.  I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Bill. In summary, we delivered a solid quarter, which capped off a strong year. We are moving into 2016 with momentum and making progress, executing our growth strategy to become the leader in integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicine. I want to invite you to join the leadership team at our Investor Day on March 10 in New York City. Operator, we are ready to take the questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik DeBruin : Hi, good morning. Hey, sort of going through your press release, getting some questions on your actions around the Venezuelan currencies and so could you talk a little bit about that and the size of that business and sort of what your expectations are for Venezuela and I guess the decision why you\u2019re treating it like it is, why you\u2019re doing the treatment this way? Bill Federici : Okay. So let me answer your questions in order. So sales are roughly $10 million annually, Derik, not a big number and our operating profit off of those sales is a little over $1 million annually. In terms of the where we are, where we are, we have been using the official exchange rate of 6.3 for medical device and pharmaceutical companies, which is the one mandated by law and we have been transacting at that rate through 2015. Obviously, they announced a devaluation to an official rate of 10 going forward. That will impact us to a certain extent, but we will continue to not recognize the full impact of a devaluation to the unofficial rates that you see that are being used to transact, since we\u2019ll be at that required to transact at that rate. We do have exposure in terms of our monetary assets of about $2 million. So when we look at our ability to get dollars out of the country, if we continue to experience delays in receiving dollars out of the country despite the fact that they\u2019ve told us that we can transact at an official exchange rate of 10, we will most likely end up writing off those monetary assets. Again, rough number is about $2 million. If we were to take out the entire operations over there which is what we've disclosed in the release, that number would be somewhere in the range of $7 million to $8 million. Derik DeBruin : So could you talk a little bit about some of the expectations in terms of capacity builds, I mean I know you're adding things and you're doing that. I guess is there an issue that you may not have enough capacity to sort of meet demand in 2016, I\u2019m just sort of just want to know what is sort of the pluses and minuses are to your organic revenue growth guidance around timing. Eric Green : I'm going to first start with this Derik and then turn over to Bill on some of the guidance. When you look at the capacity and actually I just came back from Jersey Shore and Kinston to see the plans firsthand. Jersey Shore capacity has been running pretty much almost all out because the demand has increased quite nicely with our high-value product portfolio. I can assure you that the lean efforts that are going on at Jersey Shore is increasing productivity on a per hour basis, so that's very positive. When we look at capacity expansion that we\u2019ve completed in Kinston, North Carolina, that has been validated and so we\u2019re working with other customers that continue to divert orders from Jersey Shore to Kinston, North Carolina to start offsetting some of that pressure. But the demand that you see in the backlog is the combination absolutely of increased demand from our customers but also still the fact that we have to get it through the system. Bill Federici : So, I think just to add, agree with Eric said, we have enough capacity to be able to meet our customer demands today. We do have certain bottlenecks in the operations especially for our high-value products. We've done some work, some lean activities in those affected plants to be able to increase the capacity going through those plants and we've seen the benefits of that at the very end of 2015 and certainly are seeing it in 2016 to begin with. Eric mentioned the Kinston facility and additional capacity there to help process some of those high-value product orders. So we believe we're okay, it is very tight there and we\u2019ll continue to be tight but we believe that the actions that we've taken are actually helping with that tightness and we believe that we will actually start to see the backlog come down probably in and around the third quarter timeframe of 2016. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open. Dave Windley : A follow-up on Derik's question. So, in identifying these bottlenecks, Bill, you just referred to, it is the increased demand and the stress on the system that has brought these bottlenecks to light or is this a result of some of the capacity reorganization, creation of centers of excellence and may be moving things around that has cost the bottlenecks to occur? Eric Green : Hey Dave, this is Eric. There are two elements that we are seeing, one is, there is a true increase in demand that we are seeing from the biologics\u2019 customers but also we are seeing an increase with our generics customers and they tend to come in larger volumes and shorter terms. So therefore that's one of the issues that we face in the latter half of 2015 that created some of the bottlenecks that we are experiencing today. So it is a little bit of uneven of the demand coming in but it is also due to the demand that we\u2019re seeing with the biologics customers. I would not contribute this to any network optimization that we are working on. In fact, I believe the approach that we\u2019re taking is really with new sites, new capacity, it\u2019s with new orders coming onboard. So it is not creating a bottleneck for us. Dave Windley : Okay. And I wanted to \u2013 my next question is around your segments and group. So as I read the press release, I was a little confused by the identification of the groups, but those are not - and those sound like your sales organization, your kind of your direct cost line, your manufacturing production capacity and your R&D organization is what it sounds like those groups are to me and so I was a little confused about how you would have revenue to report in global ops and innovation and technology, but the answer is you're not going to report segment along those lines rather you are reporting segments will be proprietary products and contract manufacturing. So first of all, is that correct? Is my understanding correct? Eric Green : Absolutely correct. Dave Windley : Okay. And then secondly, you did mention I think reporting or maybe you're only discussing some KPIs around the three groups. What will those be? What will you be telling us about the three groups going forward? Eric Green : Yeah, so that\u2019s a great question. So when we look at the commercial organization, we are really breaking up into four areas. Three of them are around our customer segments of biologics, pharma, engineering. So you will have \u2013 we will give visibility of the size and the growth we are experiencing within those three customer segments. The fourth one we are keeping contract manufacturing contained and we will continue to report that as a standalone entity going forward. Dave Windley : Okay. So you will report that in commercial and then will there be anything to tell us about the other two groups or not necessarily? Eric Green : We'll give you updates and then give you visibility on our cost of our operation. Manufacturing really has been the driver of growth and margin expansion and outflow in R&D is clear line of R&D investment and we will give you visibility of new products being launched as we introduce them into the marketplace. Dave Windley : Okay. I will ask one more and drop back in, if I could. So I think in the past you have talked to us about contractual arrangements for supply of the inputs to your rubber components and I'm wondering what the precipitous drop in the price of oil does to your supply costs? How much of that comes up for renewal in a given year, for example, how much of that can you effect? Eric Green : Yeah. Dave, the way to think about it is that there has been a drop in the underlying commodity, but if you remember the way our supply contracts work, we have delay into when that commodity price fits our orders, i.e. our inventory and then when that goes to our P&L, it\u2019s generally a four to six month delay. On the sales side, we have contracts with customers that are multiyear contracts with customers and they allow us to, based on the basket of goods either CPI or PPI, allow us to increase prices based on the last 12 months of activity in those underlying commodities and labor et cetera. So there is a muting effect or a hedging effect on the input cost and on our ability to catch that in these prices or declining prices as it may be. So the effect is muted. It\u2019s not as strong as the reduction that you see in the underlying commodity. We have baked into our budget that we will \u2013 that the commodities are roughly in a standard state about $45 per barrel into our budget. So we've already taken that into our guidance. So if it remains at $30 versus $45, it is not a $35 versus $45 based on this morning. It's Brent not West Texas by the way, that\u2019s the underlying reference commodity. That would not be a significant difference from where we have guided today. Dave Windley : Okay. And would you be able to qualify what margin impact that slight change within 2016 has on guidance? Can you do that or is that too? Eric Green : It\u2019s pretty small, Dave, order of magnitude of couple of cents. Dave Windley : Okay, all right. Thank you. Eric Green : You are welcome Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Hi, good morning guys. Just a couple of questions on just gross margin in the quarter and more importantly on the outlook. In Packaging Systems, obviously you had a very solid year and I think margin was up close to 200 bps on a gross level. Clearly that\u2019s being driven by the high-value products. But what prevents -- high-value packaging components, what prevents this number from rising similar or maybe modestly below last year\u2019s rate, but above what your guidance implies? Bill Federici : Yes, I mean, as you know, the growth that we have seen in the high-value products has been a little bit more than what we would look at in terms of our long-term growth trajectory for this business. We believe that our high-value products will continue to grow in the high-singles to low-doubles. We have seen it obviously this quarter with 13.5 and for the full year, it was 14, almost 15. So that\u2019s above the average. And we see this from time to time, Larry, as customers do make inventory adjustments either based on demand or in this case, some of it was in the action to our extended lead-times and for some of those high-value products. So we always come back to looking at this as what is the real underlying growth of the business. We don\u2019t think anything has changed in those long-term growth drivers, Eric mentioned that in his comments, that will cause us to believe that if anything different than that long-term 5% to 7%, 6% to 8% growth that we expect for the business of which high-value products being in the high-singles to low-doubles. On the margin line, there is a corollary effect. So we saw a very high percentage increase in the gross margins for PPS, driven as you said by that really strong high-value product growth in the quarter. But when you look at that, again try to normalize it, we have things, we know that that growth will come down, so the margin expansion will come down also. We know we will have inflationary increases in underlying overheads and labor, and we know that there are additional costs we are adding to pool. For instance, the work we are doing in Ireland and elsewhere, increase our capacity in the future, we are adding support around that, so regulatory, quality support, underlying support for those new businesses that we\u2019re trying to expand globally around the world. So we look at a normalized growth, Larry, no different than we had in the past. That\u2019s somewhere 50 and 70 basis points on the margin line is over a period of time. Some years, it will be higher as we\u2019ve seen, other years will be less, but that\u2019s where we feel very comfortable with the business in those kinds of ways. Larry Solow : Great. Switching gears a little bit, can you just update us, I know you had an initiative for some of your lower volume products, sort of limit production runs with customers, how has that been \u2013 is that still something that\u2019s an ongoing process? Bill Federici : Yes, it is Larry. It\u2019s a long-term process. Though, as you can imagine, you have to work with the customer to get them obviously on the same page as you are. But you\u2019re right, we have made some progress there, especially with some of the customers on the medical device side certainly and we look to continue to make more progress there. The obvious intention is to be able to stand our productive capacity in meeting the needs of that biologics and the generics of pharma customers for high-value products. Larry Solow : Okay. And then just on the Delivery System side, I assume the margin \u2013 the gross margin outlook is primarily driven by the expected 30% increase on CZ and SmartDose or there \u2013 is that basically the primary or are there other efficiencies and I know you had some inefficiencies and build out in some other capacity areas that has been hurting that group. So any color on that would be great. Eric Green : Yes, Larry, it\u2019s a combination of both. So we\u2019re seeing expansion of our CZ and SmartDose franchise as we continue to build out for that and utilize our facilities more effectively. I think for contract manufacturing business, we will continue to see the expansion with lean processing that team is actually quite very good at. So we are pleased to see the contract manufacturing making good progress. Larry Solow : Okay. Can you \u2013 I know, you guys generally provide some kind of quantitative update, I know, maybe you will do that at the Analyst Day. In terms of CZ, I think it was in 14 programs and SmartDose was in 8 last \u2013 we heard last quarter. Any change to that or do you want to defer until next couple of weeks to answer that question? Eric Green : Larry, I will give you a quick response to that, because that\u2019s a good question. I think when you look at SmartDose franchise, we have -- today, we have about -- we have seven in development and they continue to do quite well. The reason why they came down from 8 is because we do have 1 that is scheduled for more commercial, depending on the PDUFA date that\u2019s with Amgen that\u2019s scheduled for July of 2016. In regards to CZ, we\u2019re continuing to make progress as indicated with our recent announcement, we have 10 in formal stability studies and then we have about 1 to 4 really specifically around the generic zoledronic acid area. So again, we\u2019re making progress, customers are liking the technology that they\u2019re seeing and as I indicated in my earlier comments, we\u2019re not standing still, we\u2019re also looking at what\u2019s next for SmartDose for West to support our customers. So we\u2019re constantly moving forward and we\u2019ll give you a greater update on March 10. Larry Solow : Got it. And then just lastly on the cost savings related to the 1% to 2% headcount reduction, that $4 million to $6 million and then that gets realized this year, 8 to 10 next year, assume sort of you do half this year or averages out to half, is that, how is that going to -- roughly in the P&L, would that be both, I guess is partially manufacturing, partially SG&A probably the way to look at it? Bill Federici : Correct. That\u2019s correct, Larry. As Eric said, most of it was in the reductions or in operations, but there is some SG&A as you can imagine. There is some write-off of assets and there is some people costs. Larry Solow : Got it. And then obviously the flu situation, but I think maybe going out as you look further, there may be other sort of broader sweep cost cuts like this one or is it more just obviously you\u2019ll have the lean on this year, so it will always be ongoing, tweaks and stuff, but do you see other bigger needle movers that you can actually call out? Eric Green : Larry, I think what drove this decision and this change and as you know, we\u2019re a growing organization. We continue -- we are expanding capacity, we are expanding our relationships with our customers, the business is fundamentally very strong. The driver of this really was taking an operation that had three regions and two divisions and bring it together. And well, when you move through that type of organizational change, you do create some opportunities. We\u2019re exhausting all avenues to try and identify how we can redeploy our colleagues to the best we can, but the fact is, by going to more of a global approach with some of these areas, we are seeing some synergies, which we\u2019re taking advantage of at this time. Again, as we add capacity in our new facilities, we\u2019ll be adding appropriate resources as we expand and will continue to invest in our commercial, and also in our innovation engine groups. Larry Solow : Got it. And last question and I\u2019ll stop. CapEx, $150 million to $175 million, I think that\u2019s pretty well high telegraphed as you expand, especially in Ireland. Do you see that number sort of sitting in that range for the next couple of years and then maybe beginning to tail off in the back-end of the outlook? Eric Green : Larry, I\u2019ll talk more briefly and I\u2019ll let Bill to give you the exact numbers, but the concept is right now, we\u2019re about 10% to 12% of sales. As you can see, the big part is from Waterford, Ireland and some other capacity expansions. Our intent is to bring that down as a percentage of sales as we go forward. This year and next year, you are absolutely correct, Waterford is a larger number, but our intent is to drive that number down as we go forward. Bill Federici : I have nothing to add. That\u2019s perfect. Larry Solow : Okay, great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Bill Federici : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. Congratulations on the quarter and congratulations on that CZ win last week. Can you talk a little bit about how many trials you are involved in on the proprietary products side and what does the number look like to you in terms of the CZ, SmartDose and the proprietary products kind of trial and trial backlog so to speak? Eric Green : Yeah. Paul, thanks for your comments. As we look at where we\u2019re right now, as we mentioned in regards to CZ, we are in 10 formal stability studies and as I said, 1 to 4 generic zoledronic acid, they\u2019re various stages and as we indicated, we\u2019ve had launch of two vial, CZ vial products just recently. So we\u2019re starting to see the momentum of getting to the point where we actually can start commercializing these endeavors. So I think around SmartDose, again under proprietary, we have seven developments, again at various stages, but the interest continues to be strong. I would also argue that you know with the SmartDose as it stands today we are looking at the next generation which is also stimulating a lot of good conversation with the customers in identifying how we can improve on where we are. And then we\u2019re also obviously anticipating the commercial launch later this year of partnering with Amgen with the Repatha. So those are where we are with our formats and again we're starting to see momentum in the right direction. Paul Knight : And Bill you guided to 150 bps increase in the tax rate this year. What happens after Ireland capacity gets built, should that tax rate move back down? And then lastly, does the tax rate multi-year get even lower with other moves you can do? Bill Federici : Absolutely, thanks Paul. Good question, we absolutely agree with your comment. So, the idea is we are the beneficiary of having a very, very strong high value product portfolio. Right now, most of that is manufactured in our highest cost jurisdictions from a tax perspective both United States and Germany, little bit in France and also those are the three big ones. So when you think about it as you continue to increase the amount of high-value products sales and profits, they happen to be in those high cost jurisdictions. So it\u2019s a very high quality problem to have but one of the reasons that you know from an operating perspective we think that these centers of excellence are excellent ideas from an operating possibility. So making sure that we are providing our customers with the best absolute highest quality product we can that will be uniform in terms of where it\u2019s manufactured from. So we\u2019ll do the core manufacturing in our existing facilities like the US and Germany and France, but we will transfer those for finishing, a lot of the high-value product capacity will be in Ireland and in Singapore. When we get those online, obviously the tax rate differential between some place like Ireland that\u2019s 12.5% or Singapore that\u2019s even lower than that and say the United States which is 35% will reduce our overall effective tax rate. How low can that go is you know we certainly believe that it certainly would come back to that 27% and quite frankly over a longer period of time and longer means it\u2019s going to take a long time to get these productive facilities up to speed and validated by our customers. That we could see in the mid-20. Paul Knight : And then last Eric, why such good traction with Amgen? Eric Green : Paul, I love to be able to announce all the customers, we have really good -- I have to tell you we have a really good connectivity with a lot of customers around the world. Amgen has just been one of those great partnerships that started when they started up and I believe we are on every injectable growth that\u2019s in the marketplace today. I think the reality is that and if are to get even closer to our customers that we are identifying and working with them to solve their problems and their needs and that's what West is good at. We'll hence that as we forward, so thank you for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner from - he is a private investor. Your line is open. Arnie Ursaner : Couple of quick questions for you, in your revenue guidance, what\u2019s the mix between mixed and volume please? Bill Federici : The mix between mixed and volume, its\u2019 higher obviously on the mix change than the volume. We expect some order of magnitude about 2% to 3% on volume, a little bit of price just under 1% and the rest would be mix, Arnie. Arnie Ursaner : And in your backlog of jump of 29% what is the mix between high-value products and kind of the core or base business and how much of that backlog do you expect to ship -- the percent you expect to ship this year versus stuff that may move even further out. Bill Federici : Yeah that's a great question. So I won't give you the actual percentages that are high-value products but the high-value product percentage of the total backlog is increasing that is one of the reasons why we have such great faith in the future but also the fact that it has caused the number of orders and the duration of those orders to expand. So normally we would see in our backlog a very high percentage of that backlog be actually produced and shipped in the following quarter. With our increased lead times and our customers\u2019 additional orders both on the biologics and the engineering side, we're seeing that get pushed out not only to the next quarter being produced and shipped, but being in the next quarter, but in the subsequent quarters after that. So we're seeing a much more even distribution than a big bell-shaped curve for the high-value products and also for the overall backlog. So if we're looking at percentages rough numbers each of the quarters has increased the amount that we are going to be expect to manufacture and ship, but the ones in the - first quarter obviously is very high, but then the second, third quarters are higher than we\u2019ve seen in the past as a percentage of the total. Arnie Ursaner : So what\u2019s evolving to your longest lead time at this point? Eric Green : I am sorry, Arnie, I didn\u2019t catch the question. Arnie Ursaner : The longest lead time products, how far out are going on those? Eric Green : Well, we're in the mid-20s right which has come down from where we were with certain of the capacities and it\u2019s not the entire plan, Arnie. It\u2019s just, for instance, we had a bottleneck in the washing area where we perform our West process. We've done some changes to the manufacturing footprint, we\u2019ve actually decoupled the washing from the tack off and that has allowed us to increase the utilization of the wash loads there and has been a big benefit to us. So lead times are coming down, but as I mentioned in my commentary, we don't expect it to get through all of this and see the actual backlog return to a more normal levels until about third quarter of this year. Arnie Ursaner : Okay. Can you give us a quick update on the Arizona facility transition to SmartDose manufacturing? Bill Federici : Yeah, Arnie, that\u2019s going quite well. We are ready to go with the ramp-up of commercial volume when they become available. So at this point, we are the \u2013 Arizona investments are in place and being validated. Arnie Ursaner : Okay, two final questions from me. Can you expand a little on the SmartDose sales decline? You obviously have quite a few products in development. We are hearing a lot of new news on large molecule products that would clearly benefit from SmartDose. I guess I'd like a better understanding what caused the slowdown in your view for the upcoming year and then I have a follow-up on that? Eric Green : Thanks, Arnie. First of all, let\u2019s put into context, the slowdown was $2 million on our $1.5 billion business, so not a huge number, but it is reflective of the lumpiness of sampling activities in those proprietary products. As you know, last year, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we had lot of actual trial activity going on for SmartDose and that has subsequently ceased obviously for that one product. So you don't have that same level of orders coming through. Again, when we look at CZ and SmartDose, the sales level, we expect a significant increase in that sales level from the - rough number is 30 million that it is today to maybe even a 50% increase over that for 2016. But it's still small in terms of the overall context of our business. And high value products in the components proprietary part of this business is going to continue to drive the business in the short term, but important progress is being made on those technologies and we continue to see that and expect it to be very impactful at the back half for our plan. Arnie Ursaner : Final question for me; you mentioned in your prepared remarks $45 million in 2016 from proprietary products and you also provided in the past your 2021 outlook review. Can you walk us \u2013 maybe give us a sense of the 2021 goal for proprietary product revenue in the past from the $45 million in '16 to the past in 2021? Eric Green : In 2016, $45 million I think you're referring to, Arnie, is just CZ and SmartDose combined? Arnie Ursaner : Correct. Eric Green : Remember, there are other proprietary devices like our Medimop which is about $50 million and our safety product which is about $20 million. So overall our proprietary sales today are rough numbers, $100 million. And we expect that certainly to grow very significant teens, high teens to low-20s kind of rates, not over the time period and we expect when we look at the makeup of using the old segment nomenclature of delivery systems business, that\u2019s the combination of the proprietary delivery systems and the contract manufacturing, which right now is about 75-25, to be closer to 50-50 by the end of 2020. Arnie Ursaner : Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. On Ireland, slightly different twist on the question that was asked. I believe you\u2019re starting in Ireland with the rubber sheeting for your diabetes clients, at what point, if not already, at what point does that activity begin and what impact should we expect that to have, I guess, I am thinking primarily tax rate, but if that also has a margin impact, I would be interested in that as well. Eric Green : Yes, Dave, we are looking at completion of Phase 1 of the Waterford expansion at the end of 2017 with commercial revenue working with our customers in early 2018. So that\u2019s the timeframe of going live with manufacturing now. The volume and the impact is actually quite small on the start-ups. So it\u2019s very narrow on this particular portfolio. The bigger opportunity as we get into Phase 2 of Waterford of putting the capabilities of high-value packaging components in that facility, which will be more \u201918, \u201919 time period. Dave Windley : Okay. So that was going to be my question is, so we are talking about probably close to three, two and half years to three years to get Phase 1 in place, does it take that long to get Phase 2 in place. It sounds like, maybe not quite. Eric Green : Phase 1, just to remind you, it also has all the backbones of any additional expansion that will require on this campus, so it\u2019s really more of a campus like manufacturing process. So it won\u2019t require the same amount of time to implement. Dave Windley : Okay. And then my last question on R&D and innovation, last quarter you called out in remarks that the development activity had shifted toward customer funded projects, which then was the reason why R&D was a little lower year-over-year. This quarter R&D in each segment jumped up a little bit year-over-year and I hear you talking about second generation SmartDose. If you could just maybe zoom out on that and help us understand what their trajectory is, the activities within R&D, are they more say, company funded and proprietary or are they more customer development projects where customers stepping into fund and how does that trajectory look over the next couple of years? Bill Federici : Actually, there is two basic drivers to that going forward, right, the actual change that you\u2019ve heard in Q4 and going forward is, one is looking at the next generation of SmartDose and that is launched and we are working on that at this point. And also, if you look at a high-value product portfolio in NovaPure that\u2019s specifically around the one and the three amount plungers that gives us an opportunity to invest in R&D and launch into commercial \u2013 meaningful commercial revenues down the road. So those are the type of investments. Now, I do want to just comment that as we \u2013 one of the changes that we made with our organization that\u2019s having multiple pockets of R&D and innovation in different parts of the organization, we\u2019re bringing that together, so we can start looking at the interconnectivity between containment and delivery devices. So while it gives some efficiencies on leverage on our innovation group, we will still continue to invest and these are two particular areas that we have invested in Q4. Dave Windley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : I am not seeing any other questioners in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Eric Green : Thanks, Andrew. An online archive of the broadcast will be available at the site three hours after the call. You can also dial-in for replay and that will be available through February 25, and those instructions are on the press release. Thank you again for attending on this call and we look forward to talking to you again on our March 10 Analyst Day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This now concludes the program, and you may all disconnect your lines at this time. Everyone have a great day.",

I now turn the call over to West\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Green. Eric Green : Great, thank you Quintin. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. Q1 was a solid quarter. We\u2019re off to a good start to the year. Our team delivered strong results while executing on our market-led growth strategy focused on customer experience, operational excellence, and product and service differentiation. Looking at our financial performance, the company generated overall organic sales growth of 10.5%. This result was across all customer groups and geographies. Gross margin in the quarter was 34%, a new record high and 130 basis points better than prior year quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, also a record high and 120 basis points better than prior year quarter. All this led to Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53, which is an 18% increase over the prior year quarter despite a $0.02 currency headwind. Excluding that impact, adjusted diluted EPS would have grown by 24%. Turning to Slide 4, at the start of the year we implemented our market-led growth strategy by aligning our organization into two business segments, proprietary products and contract manufactured products. Proprietary products, which represent about 80% of overall sales, includes the former PPS segment as well as proprietary devices such as Daikyo Crystal Zenith containers, SmartDose wearable injectors, and Medimop administration systems. Within proprietary products, we have increased our focus on three market groups : biologics, generics, and pharma, and by aligning our commercial organization into each of these three groups, we are better able to address the specific needs and challenges of our customers in each market.  Sales of proprietary products grew 13% organically, driven by strong double-digit growth in biologics and generics and with mid-single digit growth in pharma. Our high-value product portfolio, which represents over 50% of segment sales, grew 22% organically. We saw strong customer demand across the high-value products, particularly for our higher performance FluroTec products, ready-to-sterilize and ready-to-use Westar products, Daikyo components, and increasing adoption of NovaPure offerings that ensure the highest standards of quality. We\u2019re also pleased with the strong double-digit growth achieved in administration systems and CZ containers.  Contract manufactured products, which represent about 20% of overall sales, grew 1.4% organically led by customers ordering in core drug delivery and diagnostic systems. As we have mentioned in the past, the contract manufacturing segment can be affected by customer timing of orders, and this quarter was impacted by a couple of delayed orders. For the full year, we continue to expect contract manufacturing to grow in the mid single digits with increasing demand for diabetes care products, including components for insulin pens and glucose monitoring devices.  I had the pleasure of attending a customer focus panel a few weeks ago after our reorganization was announced. It was great to hear the positive customer feedback that the new market-focused organization is better aligned to address in a more timely fashion the specific issues. The feedback from our customers is a reaffirmation that we\u2019re on the right journey and is providing good insight on how the whole organization - commercial, global operations, and innovation and technology - can better serve them in the future. Turning to our focus to operational excellence on Slide 5, we made great progress on increasing our manufacturing throughput with lean initiatives. I\u2019m proud of our global manufacturing sites as they have responded to the increase in demand for our high-value products portfolio. This has fueled both top line growth as well as provided a lift to our overall gross margin. We continue to make progress on our global footprint by expanding and optimizing our manufacturing capacity as sites such as Kinston, North Carolina and Waterford, Ireland. The construction of our Waterford facility remains on schedule and on budget. We expect to begin installing equipment at the site later this year with customer validation projects starting in early 2017, which keeps us on track for commercial capacity to come online in early 2018. At the end of Q1, our backlog was $437 million, which is 24% growth at constant currency from last year and 5% sequential quarterly growth. As we discussed in the past, this growth is not necessarily a direct indicator for future growth; however, it increases our confidence in our thesis of 6 to 8% overall organic sales growth. Focusing on product and service differentiation on Slide 6, our innovation and technology group also had a good start to 2016. With the announcement that Amgen\u2019s Imlygic is using break-resistant CZ vials, we have seen increased interest from other companies that are evaluating our CZ containment systems for extreme cold storage. As we outlined at our investor day in New York, we have launched a new generation of seals for [indecipherable] vials to reduce particulates and streamline the sealing process, which increases quality and addresses a pressing issue for our customers. We are in the process of scaling up production for customer trials. We continue to work closely with customers that are evaluating our SmartDose wearable injector using the CZ silicone-free container system. During this quarter, we also announced the development of a more advanced and novel wearable injector leveraging the flexibility of CZ cartridges and FluroTec laminated plungers. Earlier this week, we announced that the company has made an equity investment in NanoPass. NanoPass is a pioneer in the development and commercialization of intradermal delivery systems and collaborates with a variety of vaccine and immunotherapy product developers. This investment fits with our vision of becoming the world leader in integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines, and lets us build a strong foundation of growth through organic development and collaboration such as the one with NanoPass. We will continue a disciplined M&A approach to add and optimize our portfolio around this strategy to create long-term stakeholder value. As we look at the full year on Slide 7, we remain on track with organic sales growth guidance of 6 to 8%. With a good start to the year, we are raising the lower end of both sales and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect full-year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $2.12 to $2.25.  Now I turn it over to Bill Federici, our CFO, who will provide more color on our financial performance. Bill? William Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. We issued our results this morning, reporting first quarter 2016 earnings of $22.1 million or $0.30 per diluted share versus the $0.45 per diluted share we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Those results are summarized on Slide 8. Excluding the effects on the current quarter of the restructuring charges and the Venezuelan currency devaluation charge, our Q1 2016 adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53, an 18% increase versus the prior year quarter despite the strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduced our adjusted diluted EPS by $0.02. Those non-GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 and 16. Turning to sales, Slide 9 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Consolidated first quarter sales were $362.1 million, an increase of 10.5% over first quarter 2015 sales, excluding exchange. Proprietary product sales increased 13% versus the same quarter in 2015, excluding unfavorable exchange effects. Sales price increases in proprietary products were approximately 1.1 percentage points of the sales increase. The favorable mix of products sold and volume increases contributed to the remainder of the sales increase, with our high-value product components and systems increasing 22% versus the prior year first quarter. The current quarter HVP sales as a percentage of total proprietary sales increased by approximately four percentage points versus the prior year quarter and represented more than 50% of our total proprietary product Q1 2016 sales. CZ and SmartDose sales were $6.7 million in the current quarter versus $5.5 million in the prior year quarter. The rise in HPV sales was expected. Importantly, for the full year of 2016, we expect a high single digit to low double digit growth in high value product component and system sales versus 2015, and full-year consolidated 2016 sales are expected to grow in the 6 to 8% range ex-currency. While we achieved strong Q1 sales growth, we continue to manage the business for the long run and our long-term outlook remains unchanged with high value component and system sales expected to grow high single to low double digits. Contract manufactured products net sales increased by 1.4% versus the prior year quarter, excluding exchange. A favorable mix of products sold was offset by the pass through to customers of the decrease in plastic resin prices. This quarter\u2019s growth was adversely impacted by some customer demand delays, but we still expect mid-single digit sales growth for the full year of 2016.  As provided on Slide 10, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q1 \u201916 was 34% versus the 32.7% margin we achieved in the first quarter of \u201915. Proprietary products first quarter gross margin of 38.8% was 130 basis points higher than the 37.5% achieved in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in gross margin is due to modest price increases, the favorable mix for more HPV sales, and higher plant efficiencies offset by normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead costs. Contract manufactured products first quarter gross margin increased by 30 basis points to 14.7% compared to the prior year quarter. The current quarter\u2019s higher gross margin is primarily due to favorable mix of products sold offset by normal labor and overhead and cost increases.  As reflected on Slide 11, Q1 2016 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $2.9 million versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, first quarter 2016 SG&A expense was 16% versus 16.4% in the first quarter of 2015. Pension costs increased by $800,000 in the quarter. Compensation expense and outside services costs also increased during the current quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable effect, reducing SG&A expenses by $1 million.  Slide 12 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $3 million for the current quarter, $5 million more than the prior year quarter, reflecting the higher net income before restructuring charges. Our capital spending was $39 million in the current quarter. We expect to spend approximately $150 million to $175 million in capital in 2016. More than half of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including approximately $60 million for the construction of the new Waterford facility.  Slide 12 also provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we\u2019re confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at March 31 of $178 million was $97 million less than our December 2015 balance. Approximately $68 million of the decrease is due to the payment at maturity of our Series B euro notes. During the current quarter, we utilized approximately $9 million of cash to buy back 142,800 shares under our board-authorized program. A large majority of our cash remains invested overseas and is generally not available to be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring tax consequences. Debt at March 31 of $232 million was $66 million less than at year-end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter end was 4.8%. Working capital of $389.6 million at March 31 was $30 million higher than at year-end. The majority of the increase is due to increases in inventory and receivables related to the growth in our business.  Our backlog of committed proprietary product orders of $437 million at March 2016 was 5% higher than at year-end and 24% higher than at March 2015 backlog, excluding exchange. The backlog of committed orders continues to be impacted by our extended lead times for certain high value products.  Based on our Q1 2016 results and our analysis of the orders on hand, we have increased by $0.02 the low end of our full-year 2016 earnings guidance in this morning\u2019s release. That guidance is summarized on Slide 13. We have based on our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.12 per euro, the same rate used in our prior guidance. Our 2016 guidance excludes any additional impact from further currency devaluations, including the Venezuelan bolivar, as the company continues to operate primarily under the official exchange rates. It also excludes the expected additional expense associated with our restructuring program. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Bill. In conclusion, we\u2019re off to a strong start to the year. Our teams are focused on executing our market-led growth strategy to enhance customer experience, drive operational excellence, and differentiate with novel containment and delivery systems. We have a great team, high quality products, and a strong customer base who we are working by their side to bring new drug therapies to the market. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Bill March : Hi guys, this is actually Bill March on for Paul Knight. How are you guys doing? Eric Green : We\u2019re doing well, Bill. Good morning. Bill March : First question - maybe just looking at the sales numbers, with the backlog growing and the growth you\u2019re seeing from biologics and generics, could you maybe just talk a little bit about is that growth coming from new drug approvals or maybe existing customers migrating up the value chain to HVP products, maybe just what you\u2019re seeing from that volume and sales mix? Eric Green : Yes Bill, thanks for the question. Absolutely what we\u2019re seeing in the biologics and generics space, obviously with strong double digit growth, is really a combination of both new product launches into the marketplace but also a transition up the quality curve that we are uniquely positioned to provide with our high value products portfolio. So we\u2019re seeing a combination of both and it makes us feel quite confident for our outlook this year and forward. Bill March : Great. Then investment in NanoPass, I know that they\u2019re involved with micro-needles for intradermal injections. How that fit with your current product offerings, and where else do you see applications for their micro-needle technology? Thanks. Eric Green : Bill, with the reorganization we went through, we pulled together our innovation and technology group to take a look at all of the innovation at West from containment to delivery devices. If you look at where we want to play and our vision and our focus of the company, we do want to bring on board more capabilities around delivery devices. So we look at NanoPass, we made a small investment into NanoPass that allows us to leverage their needle technology, which really supports again the delivery devices. The key attributes when you look at their technology is around bio-availability and dose sparing, which are key issues that our customers are faced with today, so we think this is another solution, part of a portfolio that can help us more long-term. Bill March : Great, thanks. I\u2019ll hop back into the queue. Have a good day. Eric Green : Thank you, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Solow of CJS. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Good morning, guys. Great quarter. Eric Green : Thanks. Larry Solow : Can you maybe just on the backlog of 24%, I realize part of that is due to some extension of the lead times. I think, Bill, last quarter you gave us an approximate of what you think backlog would be on a true basis. Can you maybe discuss that and maybe give us a little more color on where you stand with lead times, and have some of your throughput improvements helped? William Federici : Yes, sure. Thanks, Larry, for that question. Yes, you\u2019re right - there is a combination of things impacting our backlog : real growth, and we know that that\u2019s happening, but we do know that customers continue to place orders in advance of what they normally would given our current situation of, in their minds, high lead times for certain of our high value products in certain of our plants. So it\u2019s impossible for us to give you an exact number there, but we don\u2019t see any real change in the overall growth trajectory of the business. We know that we continue to see growth in our high value products, in that high singles to low doubles, being driven by the increase incidents of chronic diseases treated with biologics and also in the generic space. We see a lot of growth in the generic space as well. But to give you an exact number, I can\u2019t, but I can tell you we still feel very, very comfortable that our growth trajectory for the full year of 2016 is going to be in that 6 to 8% range still. Larry Solow : Got it. Do you have the gross margin by segment? I realize that will probably be in the Q, but can you just-- William Federici : Well, segment meaning the-- Larry Solow : Gross margin by proprietary and contract manufactured. William Federici : Proprietary and contract manufacturing is in there. It\u2019s 38.8% for the proprietary products and it was 14.7% for contract manufacturing. So what we continue to see obviously is strong growth in proprietary products being driven a little bit by pricing, but most of it being driven by the favorable mix shift that we\u2019ve been describing this morning. With high value products up 22% versus the prior year first quarter, that really is a supercharger to the margin and has the effect of more than offsetting the increases, normal inflationary increases in our costs. Larry Solow : Right, and that was obviously a great number, not sustainable, and obviously your guidance sort of incorporates that coming back down. William Federici : Yes, and Larry, we\u2019ve talked about this a number of times. Larry Solow : Absolutely. William Federici : Our business is impacted by not only what we do, but we\u2019re a made-to-order shop, so as our customers order--and their order patterns and customer inventory management scenarios have an outsized impact on a small company like West. So while we continue to see very, very strong growth, we don\u2019t believe that that 22% growth in the--or 24% growth in the backlog and the 22% growth in high value products is really all growth. We think there are some obvious inventory management issues going on in there. Larry Solow : Got it. Just lastly, unless I missed it, can you just tell us on the $15 million write-down for some of the--on the discontinued use of some equipment in trade markets, what that was? William Federici : Yes, when we announced the board-approved restructuring plan, we knew that there were going to be things that we were doing where we were taking a look at realigning our operations more towards the future customer-facing organization that we want to be. One of the things was we wrote down our use--we had an asset on the books for the Tec name, and we wrote that down. That was about $10 million of that $15 million, and then the rest of it was writing down some of the intangibles associated with some of our development projects. Larry Solow : Got it, that\u2019s great. William Federici : [Indecipherable] Larry Solow : Got you, great. Thank you very much. William Federici : You\u2019re welcome, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Your line is open. Jerry: Hi guys, thanks for taking the call. This is Jerry [Indecipherable] on for Dave this morning. How are you guys doing? Eric Green : Doing well, thank you. Jerry: So just real quick, is there any chance you guys could break out from the high value products, break out legacy proprietary product additions that were in delivery from the kind of traditional high value products? William Federici : Not easily. I don\u2019t think we want to be giving you that level of detail. Again, we feel very, very comfortable in the long-term growth trajectory for proprietary products. We continue to see the big driver there in the near term being our biologics and generics customers, which are driving growth at high value products in the high singles to low doubles. We do know that the delivery system part of the business is growing. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks that CZ and SmartDose were $6.7 million versus $5.5 million in the prior year quarter, a growth of 20%, so we see good growth going there. The things that are growing within the high value product portfolio are the things you\u2019d expect - Westar, both RS and RU, we\u2019re seeing a lot of FluroTec growth, and we\u2019re also seeing a lot of growth in demand for Daikyo products. So I don\u2019t want to get into that level of detail, but those were the main drivers, and again we feel very, very comfortable that none of this that we\u2019ve seen in this quarter changes our near term or longer term growth trajectories for the business. Jerry: Got it, thanks for that. What\u2019s the current count of CZ development projects and SmartDose? How many of those are in trials currently? Is there any update to the seven we had talked about before, seven or eight? Eric Green : So a couple comments around the CZ portfolio and platform. We\u2019ve seen a slight uptick with additional formal stability. Obviously we announced one coming up from formal stability into commercial at this point, so today we have commercial, a couple vials, and one potential cartridge once the [indecipherable] is approved, and SmartDose and CZ cartridges obviously on that product.  What we\u2019re seeing also with the CZ, we announced obviously with the Imlygic, which is a unique characteristic around extreme cold storage. That has opened up other conversations, so we believe not just delamination, resistance to breakage, but in the attributes of glass versus CZ, we\u2019re also seeing extreme cold storage as being an attribute customers are looking at, so those conversations continue to take place. So we\u2019re quite pleased with the progress we\u2019re making there. On the SmartDose, there\u2019s two ways of looking at it. One is the existing platform that we have been working with customers on, we currently have seven in trial at this point . When you look at beyond that, we have introduced the new version or next generation of prefilled solution to the marketplace, and that\u2019s opened up a lot of conversations. So we believe not only are we staying within an existing platform that has some traction, but we\u2019re also seeing the new generation create a lot of interest in the marketplace. Jerry: And then just kind of a follow-up on the Imlygic there, can you give us any update on the uptake of the two CZ approvals, one being Imlygic and the other one that was previously announced? Is the combined $5 million to $6 million run rate still the correct way to think about those two? William Federici : Yes, that\u2019s absolutely correct. No change there. Jerry: Okay, and then just last one real quick, can you give an update on the high value components as a percentage of total volume? How much penetration is left there? William Federici : Well, it\u2019s a complicated--I\u2019ll give you a short answer and then the complication. High value products is a series of products, so a series of things that we do to the core components after they\u2019ve been manufactured. So something like Westar and FluroTec are very well penetrated in western markets, but there is still a lot of runway in front of them. But newer high value product initiations like our Envision product which is using vision systems to help increase quality, as well as NovaPure, those are still small and their penetration rates are very, very small, but we see great promise to them in the future. So if you look at as a percentage of our total manufactured products within the proprietary product space, we\u2019re less than 20% of our volume is high value products. What that number could be is really a factor of a lot of things, including the age of that high value product and the newer products coming into the market, so we believe that a lot of the--almost all of the biologics will use high value products in some way, shape or form. A lot of the generics are going to use our high value products in some way, shape or form, so we believe there\u2019s a tremendous amount of runway in front of this, and that\u2019s what gives us confidence, one of the things that gives us confidence in our ability to say that that part of our portfolio will continue to grow in the high singles to low doubles for a very, very long time. Jerry: Got it, thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter again. William Federici : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sara Silverman of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Eric Green : Sara? Sara Silverman : Can you hear me? Eric Green : Sara? Sara Silverman : Yeah, can you guys hear me? Eric Green : Operator, maybe help? We can\u2019t hear you Sara. Sara Silverman : Hey, can you guys hear me? William Federici : There you go, okay. Now we can hear you. Sara Silverman : Okay. Hey, sorry about that. I\u2019m just going to ask, Bill, can you remind us how much of the annual restructuring savings of $8 million to $10 million is expected to be in direct costs versus opex, and then how much of those savings you plan to reinvest? William Federici : Well, I don\u2019t have the breakout for you, but what we did say, as you suggested, in this year it will be less than that. In 2016, we\u2019re expecting somewhere on the order of $4 million to $6 million, so that\u2019s where we are for the current year, and it will be more in the future years as you get a full year\u2019s worth of benefit out of these. As you know, some of the restructuring charge has been taken, some of those actions, but some of them have not yet been taken. It takes some time to get through all of those. We expect them to be done the later part of this year or early part of 2017, so our run rate on the savings will be, as you suggested, more fully affected in 2017 and beyond. In terms of reinvestment, we expect to reinvest the majority of that back into the business on the commercial side of the business and in innovation and technology. So you know, our belief, Sara, continues to be that this is a tremendous growth engine for West, continuing to work on the combination of our containment systems with the delivery systems to create solutions for our customers\u2019 very novel products, and that combination we believe is very strong and is the right way to invest our funds today to make sure that we\u2019re able to satisfy those demands. Sara Silverman : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. Eric Green : Thank you, Sara. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Derik DeBruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Juan Avendano : Thank you. This is actually Juan Avendano for Derik DeBruin. William Federici : How you doing, Juan? Juan Avendano : Good, and you? William Federici : Good, thanks. Juan Avendano : Good. I had a question on the CMO business. Understand that it\u2019s lumpy, that it\u2019s dependent on the timing of customer orders. Is there any particular seasonality pattern on a quarterly basis that you could share with us to help us model it? Eric Green : No, I think the way to look at the contract manufacturing business is more over a period of the year. The size of orders that we\u2019re producing for our clients--and again, these are long-term agreements that we have because we\u2019re making investments into our facilities that run these dedicated products for quite a period of time, so we are seeing the lumpiness from quarter to quarter, but if you look at it from an overall year period of time, it\u2019s probably the best way to look at that business. Juan Avendano : Okay, got it. Then on a segment basis, I was wondering if you could share with us what the SG&A was. William Federici : We have it in the release, I believe. The SG&A--just give me a moment here. Okay, so proprietary SG&A was $41.6 million, and the contract manufacturing was $3.8 million. Those are at our quoted rates there. Juan Avendano : Good, thank you. That was it. William Federici : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Quintin Lai for any further remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you. I\u2019m going to hand it over to Eric here for closing comments. Eric Green : Thank you to everyone for dialing in. We appreciate your interest in West and we look forward to the next call after the second quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Quintin Lai. Please go ahead, sir. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to West's second quarter 2016 conference call. We issued our financial results this morning and the release has been posted in the investor section on the company's website located at www.westpharma.com. This morning, CEO Eric Green and CFO Bill Federici will review our results, provide an update on our business, and provide an updated financial outlook for the full year 2016. There's a slide presentation that accompanies today's conference call and a copy of that presentation is also available on the investor section of our website. Going to slide 2, there\u2019s a Safe Harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the presentation will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of US federal securities laws and that are based on management's beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict.

In addition, during today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including sales at constant currency, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I\u2019d now turn the call over to West's President and CEO, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we stated in our press release, we had another solid quarter and are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Looking at our financial performance, the company generated reported second quarter sales of $388 million, on a constant currency sales growth of 8.2%. The growth was broad based across all market units and geographies. Adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, equaling the record high we set last quarter and 150 basis points better than the prior year quarter. All of this led to Q2 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59, which is a 26% increase over the prior year quarter. I am pleased with how our market-led strategy is taking shape. The key pillars of that strategy are customer experience, operational excellence and product and service expansion. And I'll be highlighting in my remarks several activities that our commercial, global operations and innovation and technology teams are executing. Turning the slide 4, looking at our sales performance, we had solid contribution from both of our segments. Sales of proprietary products grew 8.9% organically, driven by double digit growth in generics and high single digit growth in biologics and pharma. Our high-value product portfolio which represents over 50% of segment sales grew 17% organically. Similar to the trends last quarter, we experienced strong customer demand across the high-value products spectrum, particularly for Westar products, Daikyo components, FluroTec products and increasing adoption of NovaPure offerings that ensure the highest standards of quality and performance. Contract-manufactured products, which represents about 20% of overall sales, grew 5.1% organically, an uptick from the first quarter growth level. Sales of drug delivery and diagnostic products more than offset continued softness in consumer products. We have good momentum heading into the second half of 2016 as our teams are ramping up tooling activities to support additional projects that will commence in Q4 later this year and into 2017. We have stated that a key strategy for the company is to become even more market-facing and improve customer experience. A key initiative in commercial is to engage with customers to provide them with valuable technical and scientific information in support of the selection and use of drug containment and delivery systems. During this quarter, West focused on providing this technical engagement in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. We held several seminars in China and India, with more than 200 customers in attendance, providing insights about market trends, challenges in selecting containment solutions for injectable medicine and strategies for selecting prefilled delivery systems for best patient outcomes. I am pleased on how our commercial organization is engaging with our customers and creating value. Turning to global operations on slide 5, we generated a gross profit margin of 34.4%, a new record high and an increase of 160 basis points from the last year. In addition to product mix shift to high-value products with expanded margins, we made good progress with our manufacturing throughput and improved efficiencies through lean initiatives across our global network. Over the course of the second quarter, I visited 13 locations across Asia, Europe, South America and the United States and I'm pleased on how our market-led strategy and key initiatives are being embraced and implemented throughout our operations. In fact, I had the opportunity to see firsthand how we drive operational excellence in our plants to continuously improve safety, quality, delivery and cost. I want to share a few areas that our global operations team is focused on and the results we are seeing. The first is quality. As you know, we place a high emphasis on working with our customers to address their quality needs. As a result of our initiatives, we have reduced out-of-spec products by more than 33% year over year. To dimension this achievement, of the 32 billion components that our proprietary segment sells each year, we have achieved an out-of-specification metric of well under 100 parts per 1 billion sold. Needless to say, quality remains a key differentiator for West and we continue to raise the bar. As we stated in the last quarter's call, our global operations has been working to reduce order lead times to our customers. We're now seeing shorter lead times across our network and as a consequence our backlog is down from peak Q1 levels. We expect further lead time improvements in the back half of the year and a reduction of year over year backlog growth which will better match our core demand. During my travels, I also visited our state-of-the-art facility now under construction in Waterford, Ireland. The project remains on-time and within budget. As you can see from this recent photo, phase one includes this impressive building in the foreground, which will house new capacity to manufacture CD material for cartridges used within insulin pen injector systems, expected to be online for commercial sales in early 2018. Turning to slide 6, earlier this month, Amgen announced that it received FDA approval of its Repatha drug for use with our SmartDose technology platform. I'm proud of our innovation and technology team for achieving this milestone. Our team continues to work with Amgen as they prepare for an August commercial launch in the US. For West, this marks just the beginning for our integrated injectable drug delivery strategy. When you look at Amgen\u2019s monthly dosing system for Repatha, you see a product combining several of our proprietary containment and delivery technologies. We continue to see strong interest by our customers in our on-body drug delivery technology, including several customers that are currently evaluating SmartDose. Repatha also marks the third FDA approved use of Crystal Zenith containment technology over the last 12 months. We continue to work with several customers to test CZ technology with their drugs in formal stability studies and are working with numerous customers that are conducting early stage evaluations. Turning to slide 7, I want to highlight a new product line that\u2019s important to our customers\u2019 success. While SmartDose and Crystal Zenith get a lot of attention, the vast majority of our sales and products come from our components business. And this business has been growing as we continue to introduce new high-value products to meet our customers\u2019 needs for high quality [intervenic] containment and delivery of their important drugs. The newest member of our high-value product family is the 1-3mL NovaPure Plunger. We\u2019re seeing a trend towards larger volume injections beyond typical 1 mL applications, especially for new biologic therapies in auto injectors. We have introduced a new 1-3mL Plunger developed using quality by design principles. The NovaPure platform is the highest standard of quality in our portfolio. Turning to slide 8 and the outlook for the balance of 2016, our teams have responded well to the realignment of our organization at the start of the year and have embraced our market-led strategy. We have two good quarters under our belt and we're well positioned as we enter the second half of the year. Therefore, we are raising our organic sales growth outlook for the year to 7% to 9% compared to a prior outlook of 6% to 8%. We're also raising the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range, which is now $2.15 to $2.25, an increase over prior year of 17% to 23%. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill Federici, our CFO, who will provide more color on our financial performance. Bill? William Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. We issued our second quarter results this morning, reporting net income of $44.7 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Our reported results this quarter include $0.01 per diluted share reversal of a portion of our previously provided restructuring reserve. Excluding this restructuring activity, our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.59 this quarter, $0.12 above the $0.47 per adjusted diluted share earned in the second quarter of 2015. Turning to sales, slide 10 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Our consolidated second quarter sales of $388 million increased by 7.9% versus our second quarter 2015 sales. Excluding the $1.2 million adverse currency effect, our Q2 2016 sales increase increased by 8.2%. Proprietary net sales increased 8.9% versus the same quarter 2015, excluding exchange. Sales price increases accounted for 1.1 percentage points of this sales increase and the favorable mix of products sold and volume increases contributed the remainder of the increase. Sales of our high-value products rose 16.6% versus the prior year second quarter. Current quarter HVP sales as a percentage of total proprietary products sales increased by 3 percentage points versus a year ago. We continue to see strong customer demand for our product offerings that meet our customers\u2019 high quality expectations. The combined Q2 revenues from CZ and SmartDose of approximately $5 million was $3 million less than the combined 2015 Q2 sales, reflecting the lumpiness of customer sampling demand. Contract-manufactured net sales increased by 5.1% versus the prior year quarter, ex currency. As provided on slide 11, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q2 2016 was 34.4% versus the 32.8% margin we achieved in the second quarter of 2015. Proprietary second quarter gross margin of 38.5% was 1.5 margin points higher than the 37% achieved in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in gross margin was due to modest price increases, the favorable mix of sales and lower raw material costs, offset by normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead. Contract-manufactured second quarter gross margin increased by 1.2 margin points to 17.6% due to the favorable mix of products sold and volume increases, offset by higher labor and increased overhead cost associated with new capabilities supporting contract-manufacturing customer programs. As reflected on slide 12, Q2 2016 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $1.7 million versus the prior year quarter. [Merit related] increases in compensation costs and higher pension expenses were partially offset by lower stock and incentive comp cost. As a percentage of sales, second quarter 2016 SG&A expense was 16.1% versus 16.9% in the second quarter of 2015. Slide 13 shows our key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our year to date operating cash flow is $3.6 million above what we generated in the first six months of 2015, due primarily to our higher earnings and lower current year pension plan funding. Our capital spending was $74 million for the first six months of 2016, approximately $17 million more than at this time in 2015. We expect to spend $150 million to $175 million in capital in 2016. Approximately 50% of planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including approximately $60 million for the construction of our new Waterford facility. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we're confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at June 30 of $203 million was $70 million less than our December 2015 balance. The decrease reflects the February 2016 $68 million payment at maturity of our euro B notes. Additionally, we have made $17 million of purchases under our stock buyback program. Debt at June 30 of $231 million was $67 million less than at year end, reflecting the euro B notes repayment. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter end was 2.5%. Working capital of approximately $420 million at June 30 was $60 million higher than at year end. The majority of the increase is due to increases in our accounts receivable and inventory balances. Looking ahead, our backlog of committed proprietary product orders was $417 million at June 2016, 20% higher than at June 2015, excluding exchange. However, as expected, the June 2016 backlog is about $30 million less than its January 2016 peak. Based on our year to date 2016 results and our analysis of the orders on hand, we revised our full year 2016 guidance in this morning's release. Our guidance is summarized on slide 14. We believe that 2016 quarterly results for our business will follow historical seasonality wherein results for the third quarter are traditionally lower than the results achieved in our first and second quarters due to customers and our plant summer shutdown. We have raised our proprietary revenue guidance and our expectations for proprietary gross profit margin to reflect the increased demand for our high-value product components. We now expect organic sales growth for the full year 2016 to be in the range of 7% to 9%. Our revised guidance also reflects a reduction of contract- manufactured products\u2019 gross profit margin due to a higher percentage of low-margin development [indiscernible] anticipation of future commercial orders and less labor and overhead absorption in contract-manufactured plant due to the timing of customer programs. Other items affecting our revised EPS guidance are increased SG&A spending to support our growing business and a higher share count driven by increased option exercise activity. We now expect full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25. We've based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.12 per euro, which is the same rate used in our prior guidance. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great, thank you, Bill. In conclusion, we delivered another solid quarter with momentum for the balance of the year. Our teams are making progress executing on our growth strategy and more importantly the feedback from customers has been extremely positive. We believe we are building on a position of strength, continuing to deliver value for our customers and for our shareholders. Andrew, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I'm sure we have a question or comment coming from the line of Paul Knight from Janney. Bill Marsh : This is actually Bill on behalf of Paul. First question, you kind of highlighted the market-led strategy. How has that maybe helped your conversations with customers? And then specifically looking at the growth that you're seeing in generics, how are their demands different from some of the other customers and how do you migrate them up towards high-value products? Eric Green : Absolutely. So the market-led approach [indiscernible] traction in the conversations we are having with our customers. Just to reiterate, we have aligned our commercial organization really around the generics, the biologics, pharma and we also have contract- manufacturing. And what we\u2019re identifying is we\u2019re creating value proposition that allow our product portfolio to be better aligned to the customer needs. A great example was the recent launch of the 1-3mL NovaPure Plunger, which clearly supports the biologics customer base with the need of larger volume for injectable medicine in auto injectors. So we're seeing good traction. I would also articulate, I\u2019d say that the teams are more focused on getting more insight information from the customers on the needs, which really lends itself into your second question about generics. One thing that we're learning about generics is that the need of high-value products is actually more important than we originally thought because we have a team that is just dedicated for generics are having conversations with the customers on a daily basis. What we're seeing is the growth in generics is really driven by the high-value product portfolio which obviously is higher margin, higher sales and longer stickiness. And the reason for that, the fundamental reason is speed to market. They're looking to get their drug on the market fast and the high-value product portfolio allows them to get approval by the regulatory bodies faster than just the standard products. So that's a good example on this new market-led approach and the traction that we're gaining in the marketplace. Bill Marsh : And then just a follow-up, looking at the improvement in gross margins, if you look at the bridge, 80 basis points is from kind of lean initiatives it seems, what's driving that improvement? And as we think about margin expansion opportunities at West, how should we maybe think about efficiencies versus volume and mix? Eric Green : I\u2019ll start with the first section and have Bill Federici add some more color. So when you look at \u2013 we made a change, West has a very strong manufacturing footprint globally with 28 sites around the world. But the one change we made in the early part of the year is we actually pulled together the global operations under one team. And what we're experiencing at this point it is a concerted effort and focus around lean initiatives. And so to give you an example, our contract manufacturing business for several years has been really driving lean principles. We actually are taking those concepts and start spreading it globally to our sites. I mentioned earlier I had the opportunity to travel to all our \u2013 most of our locations around the world. In Europe, one of the most impressive changes I've noticed over the last year is that when you go to the different plants, there's really clear initiative to drive continuous improvement which is driving costs out of the system. So I think you\u2019re going to continue to see opportunities for us to expand margins, not just product mix and a little bit of price, but really it\u2019s going to come from lean principles and make sure it's part of our DNA going forward at West. Bill? William Federici : I agree with everything Eric said, Bill. And just to put a little more flavor around it, efficiencies are important and we will continue to see, as Eric said, margin expansion coming from that. But as a reminder, our growth equation is predominantly a mix equation right now. We have a little bit of price helping the margin, a big lift coming from not only introduction of new products that are requiring our high-value products especially from the biologics area, but as Eric said earlier, the migration from standard product to high-value products coming from our generics customers. We really see that as being the number one driver of the margin expansion going forward being augmented by good efficiency and lean in our plants. Operator : And our next question or comment comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Tim Evans : Bill, I think earlier in the year, you kind of said that you were targeting $40 million-ish for Crystal Zenith and SmartDose in the year. Does your early experience with the product that was approved give you comfort in that target? William Federici : Yes, absolutely, Tim. We\u2019re seeing that while the quarter itself was short of last year's second quarter for CZ and SmartDose, that's the nature of our business right now, most of it being of a sampling origin. But as we continue to look at the backlog of committed orders from our one customer on SmartDose as well as those other customers for CZ and some development activity that we have relative to the two, both SmartDose and CZ, we feel comfortable in that $40 million target. Tim Evans : And the second one was on, I guess there was a little bit of a reversal of your restructuring charge from Q1, what should we read into that? Are you just excited to do a little less or what\u2019s going on there? William Federici : It's accounting, I hate to be an accountant and have to explain something like this. But you know the way the accounting works, at the beginning of the plan, once the plan is approved and you have site to the plan, you disclose the entire plan, but you're only allowed to take the income statement charges as it relates to the actual activity happening. So severance for instance, you take that, we set up a provision at the first quarter reflecting what our guesstimate was at that based on the activity that we had. And in one of our geographic locations, the actual number of persons that are affected by this has gone down slightly due to : one, some people left on their own accord; and two, we have in certain locations, you have the knock-on effect where a senior person can displace someone below them and end up with less severance for us. So bottom line is it's an accounting enigma that we had a reversal of a provision that was set before. We will have [indiscernible] we said it before, we will have additional expenses that we will provide for in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to progress the restructuring plan. Tim Evans : And then the last one, your tax rate for the first half of the year has been fairly materially below your guidance for the full year which suggests that there's going to be a pretty meaningful step up in the back half, is that the correct interpretation? William Federici : No, I think what we should take into it is that we believe that the [management rate] that is the rate without all of the special charges for restructuring et cetera and benefits from those will be in that 28%, 28.5% range. And the increase from the prior year is really reflective of an increase in the geographic mix of earnings. So we're earning more money in places like the US and Germany and we will continue to do so, basically driven by high-value products. And that we believe our best guess at this point in time is 28.5% for the rest of the year. Tim Evans : For the rest of the year, not the full year? William Federici : For the full year. Operator : And our next question or comment comes from the line of Derik DeBruin with Bank of America. Juan Avendano : This is Juan Avendano on behalf of Derik. Congrats on the quarter and on the approval of the first drug with the SmartDose. And so I actually wanted to start with the SmartDose. I don\u2019t know if you could provide a comment, an update on the next generation SmartDose, the one that comes with the prefilled syringe, any customer feedback and any potential timeline of anybody or any customer starting potential studies with it? Eric Green : So we\u2019re in early stages of development at this point with the next generation with customers. I\u2019d tell you it is on schedule. What we're seeing is an increased interest to have a device that is pre-fill, two components, and we\u2019re having several discussions with our customers. So the interest level is good. But I would say that we\u2019re on schedule and it's going to take a few years before we start seeing uptick with this next generation. Juan Avendano : And if I may go back to the first question regarding the market-led strategy, so in this quarter, if I compare the growth rates that you experienced particularly in pharma and generics, they were higher than the long term growth rates that would have been expected based on your 2016 Analyst Day this year. So generics did double digits as opposed to like the long term expectation of mid to high single digits and pharma did high single digits versus low to mid single digits. And so my question is now that you've had this market-led strategy for a few months, has there been a change towards a more improved outlook on these markets in the long term? Eric Green : No, I wouldn\u2019t say there's been a change. I think what you're seeing is little bit of a variance between quarter to quarter. But if you look at the full year, in particular 2016, we feel good about looking at double digit growth both on generics and biologics units and mid single for our pharma. In addition, just to add on to that, our contract manufacturing, as we\u2019ve said, is picking up momentum, we believe mid single for contract manufacturing also. So it's a little bit of a variance between quarter to quarter. We have good line of sight with our customers. I think the market-led approach has given us better visibility on demand, future demand and therefore our confidence level is rising. Operator : And our next question or comment comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : Juan took one part of my SmartDose question; the other part was just customer response. Now that you've gotten the kind of the headline of an approval, what kind of reaction from the customer base have you seen on the heels of that, if any? Eric Green : I think the way to address that is that once the announcement came out there's been an increase of conversations with key customers. What we've learned in our business over the years is that once you have approval on new technology or even new components, the interest level goes up. So we're seeing an increase in interest for both SmartDose and CZ and we believe will continue to go forward as this product launches. David Windley : Have you quantified and if not can you quantify what you expect your, call it, stable revenue or run rate revenue for SmartDose supply for this most recent approval would be? I guess there are some contingent factors there. William Federici : Dave, we're under a confidentiality agreement with our customers. So we don't talk about volumes. David Windley : Are the two approvals of CZ products trending in line with expectations? Eric Green : Yes, they are in line with expectations and also where we are in stages of various stability tests that are going on right now. We think the pipeline is strong and in line consistent to what we've communicated. David Windley : Shifting to facilities, Eric, you talked about the 28 facilities in lean manufacturing and then there was also Tim\u2019s question on tax rates. So I'm curious about looking at the slide with Waterford on and you say construction is on track, I guess I'm curious about how completion of that facility happens, I think there's some activity already ongoing there perhaps and then how you migrate business into Ireland in a way that will re-route or redirect profitability of the company into your Irish operations that would then flow through to tax rates, so kind of multi-faceted question there. Eric Green : Dave, that\u2019s a good point. So we're really focusing on creating centers of excellence especially around our high-value products portfolio. And in Europe we have selected, while we do manufacture in Germany, in France and a few other locations of our high-value product portfolio, we\u2019re focusing to concentrate the next generation, next level of quality out of our Waterford facility. To start with, we are going to be manufacturing and we haven't started by the way, just construction commenced, premise completed, and we'll be doing testing for our customers in 2017 with first commercial dollars in early 2018. But it's really around the [indiscernible] the first phase. And then the second phase we will be starting to put in more high-value products finishing. And that allows us to move commercial revenues through that entity going forward. I'll let Bill comment on implications on the taxes. William Federici : So I think Dave the key point that Eric made is important is that this is really driven by the customer demand for higher-quality products. So we are putting the centers of excellence in, first one to be in Ireland and we think there will be one maybe in Singapore will allow us to meet the high level demands of our customers for higher-quality product. And yes, we will be \u2013 as new customers come on and once that facility is up and running which probably won't be until 2019, 2020 timeframe, so we're talking way out there, there will be revenues that will be naturally recorded in that country. There will be an ancillary benefit of having the corporate tax rate there is 12.5% as you know, which is less than our global rate and certainly less than the US. But the primary focus of those centers of excellence again is to drive a high-quality product and be able to meet those very, very high quality demands from our customers. And lastly, this tax impact that you're talking about won't take effect until we actually have commercial revenues, which wouldn't even start until 2018. David Windley : So gaining that out, you\u2019ve got testing in 2017, commercial revenue in 2018, building that up and then would it be right to think that you don't really visit a tax strategy behind that that would be kind of a lagging activity relative to the ramp of the revenue? William Federici : Absolutely, absolutely. So as the revenue ramps, I think it's actually corollary, right, as the revenue ramps, we believe it will be our highest value products being pushed through that plant because that's what the customers demand and therefore higher profits, lower tax, should generate a lower tax rate on that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question or comment comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Larry Solow : I joined a little late, juggling between a couple of calls, so I\u2019m not sure if this question was asked. But just on the \u2013 I noticed you guys on your prepared remarks talked about certainly the initiatives to improve throughput and reduce the lead times is certainly starting to gain some traction. Can you just sort of give us an update on where you stand, is there still a lot more low-hanging fruit or improvement you expect over the next couple of quarters? And just backlog number of 20%, could you sort of maybe guesstimate where it would be without the sort of earlier ordering or increased ordering earlier on? Eric Green : Let me start by saying that with these lean initiatives, I mean we're obviously pushing to be part of the, I call the DNA of the organization, so we're really focusing on especially in our high-value product manufacturing plants, identify and decouple some of the processes so we can be more efficient with the assets we currently have on the ground. So it is really driving that mindset around ROIC, looking at delivery times for our customers. And so we\u2019re seeing early signs of success, but this is a journey. It's going to take some time, but I think there's opportunities as we look at our facilities around the world. And I think as we talked a little bit earlier about our center of excellence concept, now we have a great opportunity to make sure that the processes we put into Waterford are the leading cutting edge that gives us the efficiencies, the highest quality and service, and also quality and service to our customers. So we have room for opportunities to continue to improve, Larry. I think Bill if you want to touch here? William Federici : Sure. On the current backlog situation, you're absolutely right, Larry. It has come down from the peak, January peak was about $450 million, it\u2019s about $30 million less than that now. So we are seeing good progress as Eric mentioned along that curve, but there is still room to run. We are seeing the desired effect of customers not having to place orders as far in advance as there has been which caused that backlog to increase. So we expect that this number will continue to go down. So as we see anniversarying comparing it to the prior year, we'll see the growth number come down the growth over the prior year and sequentially we think we will actually see the dollar amount of the backlog come down. What that exact number is, Larry, is very, very difficult to tell. As we\u2019ve said in the past, it really depends on a number of things, when the customer places the order, each year a customer may have different things going on in their own shop. They may have been looking at some kind of change in their own product portfolio and therefore maybe ordering in advance or waiting to order further later. So it really is a customer by customer analysis. We can say anecdotally that we know that it's higher than it should be, but an exact number to put on it to suggest what the right number is a guess. And I would say that\u2019s somewhere in the mid to high $300 million would be where I would place a normal amount of backlog for our proprietary products. Larry Solow : I appreciate that. And I realize it's a challenge and somewhat of a guess. Just lastly on \u2013 I know you tweaked your gross margin expectations I guess or consolidated remain the same and proprietary a little higher and I assume that's just getting better traction and better sales in the high-value product. The tweak down on the contract manufacturing side, is that just some temporary inefficiencies and I realize that\u2019s relatively a small number on the tweak down on the gross margin, but any color there would be great. William Federici : It\u2019s what you said. It's really reflective of \u2013 it\u2019s such a small number. When you have tooling and development revenues which is what we expect to come in the back half of them, you'll see a less of a margin on those. You don't get the same margin you would on a commercial product. But the good news is that that's a, what we believe and anticipation of actual commercial orders increasing for those customers since they're doing development activities with us. So while it does have the effect of less overhead absorption and therefore lower margin, we believe that it\u2019s still a positive. We still feel very comfortable with the mid single growth rate for the contract-manufactured product business and we believe that their margins will continue to grow due to a mix shift and lean. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions or comments. So with that said, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Quintin Lai for closing remarks.

Now, I will turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin,and good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As we\u2019ve said in our press release, we had another solid quarter and expect a good finish to the end of the year. Our end-markets are growing and we expect the momentum from 2016 to continue into 2017. Today, we are introducing our preliminary 2017 organic sales growth guidance. We are also reaffirming the long-term 2020 financial targets that we introduced last year. 2016 is the first full-year of our strategy plan, and I am pleased with our progress. We have realigned the organization through our market led strategy, expanded manufacturing capacity, launched new high-value product, and our customers have received regulatory approval for several products using Crystal Zenith and SmartDose technologies. Looking at our financial performance, in the third quarter, we generated reported sales of $377 million. That represents a constant currency sales growth of 10%. Importantly, these results were broad based across all market units and geographies. Adjusted operating margin was 14.2% and 100 basis-points better than the prior year quarter. We are getting margin expansion contribution from a number of sources, including gross margin expansion from a high value product mix and by leveraging our operating expenses. All of this led to Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53, which is a 20% increase over the prior year quarter. Turning the slide four, looking at our sales performance. We had solid contribution from both of our business segments. Sales of our proprietary products grew 11.6% organically, driven by double-digit growth in biologics, high single-digit growth in generics, and mid-single digit growth in pharma. Our high-value product portfolio, which represents over 50% of segment sales, grew 25% organically. Just like we saw last quarter, we experienced strong customer demand across the high-value products spectrum, particularly for FluroTec products, Westar are ready-to-use product, Daikyo components, administration systems, and the increasing adoption of our NovaPure offerings. Our customers continue to look to West, provide critical components and solution to contain and deliver their injectable drugs. We are meeting this challenge with innovative high-quality products that are available when needed. We have introduced new high-value products, NovaPure 1ml to 3ml plungers, being the most recent example. The recent milestone successes in the form of customer approvals of several drugs with our Crystal Zenith containment platform and SmartDose drug delivery platform, validates that we are in the right track. Especially satisfying is that these headline successes are attracting new customers that are conduction early evaluations of both CZ and SmartDose. Some of our customers prefer to develop their own delivery technologies and outsource the contract manufacturing of their devices. We are supporting these customers through our contract manufacturing groups. West's contract manufacturing has tremendous engineering knowhow, and is known for high-quality, high-volume production expertise, making West one of the premier CMOs. Contract manufacturing products, which represent 21% of overall sales, grew 4.6% organically in the quarter. Our pipeline of new delivery in diagnostic devices is robust. We have started the two in phase for these projects and this will continue in Q4 as our customers prepared for commercial launch in 2017. Turning to global operations on slide five. We\u2019ve generated a gross profit margin of 32.1%, an increase of 70 basis-points over the last year. This quarter, we experienced our typical seasonal plant shutdowns for preventive maintenance. We also experienced incremental low margin contract manufacturing tooling sales. Despite these headwinds, the favorable mix of faster growing high-value product helps fuel the year-over-year gross margin expansion. As we have said on these conference calls earlier this year, our global operations team has been working to reduce delivery lead-time to our customers. The team has made great stride in shortening lead-times across our network, which has resulted in a reduced backlog from peak Q1 levels. The underlying demand for high-value products from all three of our market units remained strong. As just shown over the last five-years, in fact, over the past 10 years and as we continue to see today, we are growing the high volume product portfolio in excess of 10% CAGR. I\u2019m also pleased to announce to David Montecalvo has joined West as Head of Global Operations and Supply Chain. David brings a wealth of expertise in global operations, business integration, and product development. As we continue to make significant progress in achieving the operational excellence objectives outlined in our long-term business strategy, including our margin expansion targets, David is a welcome addition to the West team, and we intend to leverage his experience to continue to build upon the progress our team has made. I also want to mention the recent hurricane that impacted the Caribbean in the Atlantic coastal region of U.S. One of the impacted areas was Kingston, North Carolina, where floodwater devastated homes and the surrounding communities. We have a key manufacturing facility in Kingston. While our plant was not damaged, we did have to shut down operations for a few days as many roads were closed. We are back to full operations and we took actions to ensure continuation of customer supplies. Most importantly, all of our employees are safe. Turning to slide six, and the outlook of the balance of 2016. We remained on track for a solid full-year of organic sales growth and expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow roughly double the rate of sales. We now expect to be at the upper end of the 7% to 9% full year organic sales growth range we previously announced. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.17 to a $2.22, a year-over-year increase of 19% to 21%, which includes the headwinds from changes in FX. Bill Federici, our CFO, will go into more detail on this during his presentation. Turning to slide seven. Last year, we introduced our long-term 2020 financial targets. We remain on-track in year-one of the plan with strong sales growth and operating margin expansion over 2015. We expect to carry this momentum into 2017, and are introducing initial guidance to be at the upper-end of our long-term target of 6% to 8% organic sales growth. We also reaffirm our 2020 financial targets. Now, I turn it over to Bill Federici who will provide more color on our financial performance. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. We issued our third quarter results this morning, reporting net income of $37.6 million or $0.50 per diluted share. And to summarize on slide eight, excluding the one-time items from both this year and the prior year\u2019s quarter\u2019s results, our adjusted earnings per diluted share are $0.53 this quarter, 20% higher than our adjusted third quarter 2015 earnings per diluted share. Turning to sales, slide nine shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Excluding translation exchange effects, our consolidated third quarter sales of $376.7 million increased by 10% versus our third quarter \u201915 sales. Proprietary product segment sales increased 11.6% versus the same quarter 2015, excluding translation exchange. Sales price increases accounted for 1 percentage-point of sales increase and the favorable mix of products sold and volume increases contributed to remainder of the increase. Sales of our high-value products rose 25% versus the prior-year third quarter. As a percentage of proprietary product segment revenues, high-value product sales grew more than 6 percentage points versus Q3 2015, representing more than half of our proprietary product segment sales. We continue to see strong customer demand for our product offerings that meet our customers\u2019 high quality expectations. Sales in CZ and SmartDose were $8 million in the quarter, $600,000 above the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Contract manufactured product net sales increased by 4.6 percentage points versus the prior year quarter, ex-translation. The majority of the increase in contract manufacturing sales was driven by increased demand for diagnostic and delivery devices. As providing on slide 10, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q3 2016 was 32.1% versus the 31.4% margin we achieved in the third quarter of \u201815. Proprietary product third quarter gross margin of 36.4% was nine tenth of margin point higher than the 35.5% achieved in the third quarter of \u201815. The increase in gross margin is due to modest price increases and a continuing favorable mix of sales offset by higher Japanese yen denominated raw material costs and increases in labor and overhead costs. The yen\u2019s strength is approximately 16% versus the prior year\u2019s third quarter. That adverse the yen transactional rate increase raw material price costs and thereby decrease consolidated Q3 gross profit margin by 110 basis-points. Contract manufactured third quarter gross margin declined by eight tenth of the margin point to 16%, primarily due to some low margin tooling revenues and increases in labor and overhead costs. As reflected on slide 11, Q3 2016 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $3.7 million versus the prior year quarter due to merit infringe increases, more headcount focused on our new market led organization, as well as increased pension expense. As a percentage of sales, third quarter 2016 SG&A expense was 15.5% versus 15.8% in the third quarter of \u201915. Slide 12 shows our key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our year-to-date operating cash flow of $147.6 million is $3 million above what we generated in the first nine months of 2015. Our capital spending was $123 million for the first nine months of \u201916, approximately $36 million more than at this time in 2015. We expect to spend approximately $150 million to $175 million in capital in 2016. Approximately 60% of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including approximately $60 million for the construction of our new Waterford facility. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we\u2019re confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at September 30th was $205.9 million, $69 million less than our December 2015 balance due primarily to the payment at maturity of our Euro B notes in February 2016. Debt at September 30th was $231.2 million, $67 million less than at year-end, reflecting the payment at maturity of our Euro C notes. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter-end was 2.2%. Working capital at September 30th totaled $421 million, roughly $62 million higher than at year-end, primarily due to increases in receivables in inventories reflecting our growing business. Looking ahead, our backlog of completed proprietary product orders stands at $388 million at September 2016, about 2% lower than at September 2015, excluding exchange effects and was about $60 million less than its January 2015 peak. As expected, our order backlog is decreasing as a result of actions we are taking to reduce order lead-times for certain high-value products. Based on our year-to-date 2016 results and our analysis of the orders on-hand, and despite the impact of unfavorable currency effects, we have raised our 2016 full-year sales guidance and tightened our full-year 2016 earnings guidance in this morning's release. That guidance is summarized on slide 13. Achieving the forecasted sales level revenue would result in full-year sales growth at the upper-end of our prior guidance range of 7% to 9% at constant rates. And adjusted diluted EPS should be in the range of $2.17 to $2.22 per share. We have based our guidance on the exchange rate of $1.10 per euro versus the $1.12 per euro assumption using our prior guidance. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar versus most currencies has adversely impacted earnings throughout 2016. We also recognized the continued adverse effects on raw material purchases of a strengthening yen versus the U.S. dollar and the euro. These currency headwinds had reduced reported Q3 earnings by $0.04, and are expected to adversely impact Q4 results by about $0.03, and are included in our full year 2016 guidance. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great, thank you Bill. In conclusion, strong high-value product sales, underlying market growth, and excellent execution of our market led strategy, had contributed to another solid quarter. And we\u2019re confident we will deliver the balance of the year. As we prepare for 2017 and our long-term plans for the Company, we are building on a position of strength, which will allow us to continue to deliver value for our customers and for our shareholders. Jonathan, we are ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instruction] And our first question is from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Tim Evans : Thank you. Bill thanks for the color on 2017 and 2020. Can you help us understand how much of your 2020 margin guidance you feel like is now dependent on uptick of CZ and SmartDose versus other high-value product mix shift? Bill Federici : The bulk of that increase in margin from where we are today to 2020 is relative to the components business, and especially driven by high-value products. So, the percentage of that growth relative to CZ and SmartDose is small. Tim Evans : And then as you think about the pacing from where we are in 2016 to where we need to be in 2020. Should we be pacing that fairly evenly or do you still feel like it's just more back-end loaded? Bill Federici : Yes, it is more back-end loaded. We will see good strong growth based on what we talked about, the favorable mix shifts, a little bit of price, and the operational efficiencies and leading programs that we have in place. But there is some. In the back-half of the plan, there is some accelerated growth due to all the proprietary deliveries, including our -- not only CZ and SmartDose, but also including many mark product as well. Tim Evans : And lastly, did you quantify the impact of the Kingston facility brief time out there? Bill Federici : No, we did not. Operator : And our next question is from Derek DeBruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Juan Avendano : This is Juan Avendano on behalf of Derek. How are you guys? Eric Green : Good morning, Juan. Juan Avendano : Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. And I wanted to follow-up on the adjusted operating margin expansion. And so, I had been a recent competitor conference you mentioned that on a normalized basis, based on your long-term organic growth guidance of 6% to 8%, you would expect 50 to 70 basis-points from the mix shift on to more HVPs. But obviously this is exclusive of the operational improvements. And so, how much of a margin contribution on a normalized basis would you expect from your operational initiatives only? Eric Green : That will change each year. The 50 to 70 basis-points on gross margin is an average. We like to think about it from an operating profit margin basis of about 100 basis-points in total. So, if you want to do the math, you can do the math. But operational efficiencies will be somewhere in that 30 to 50 basis points depending on the year. Juan Avendano : Another questions I had is, just curious I mean usually in pre-Q you issue a five-year outlook, five-years outward, in this case you reaffirmed 2020. Why not give 2021 guidance this quarter? Eric Green : Juan, that\u2019s a very good question. We historically have given the five-year guidance to our target, that\u2019s correct. This year as we say last year we\u2019re very focused on strategies that we just launched. We\u2019re very pleased about the first year of that performance. And we\u2019re keeping the organization focused on delivering on the 2020 targets that we have communicated. I think at this point that\u2019s where we will stay focused on, is as things developed and changed overtime, we will continue to update. But we\u2019re really focused on the 2020 target at this point. Operator : And our next question is from Paul Knight of Janney Mont. Your line is now open. Bill Marsh : This is actually Bill on behalf of Paul. How are you doing? Eric Green : Good. How are you doing Bill? Bill Marsh : Doing well. Maybe just talking about the five year plan Eric, year-one focused around realigning the sales organization, and organic growth has grown by about 300 basis-points versus last year. What should we think about as the next step of next evolution of the plan? Eric Green : Bill, that\u2019s a good question. We look at our business. We\u2019ve mentioned before about half our business is around the biologic and the generic customer segment. And as you know we\u2019ve mentioned that we\u2019re growing well in the double-digits with both on the year-to-date in 2016. The underlying trends in the biologics is very favorable for West, and our base has been larger around the biologics. And it\u2019s not just the core elastomer steel business, but it's also the adoption and the interest on our self-injecting systems, which encompasses SmartDose and CZ and SmartDose devices. So, fundamentally, when you look at as the business continues to grow with the biologics and the generics momentum that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s really being driven by the high-value products portfolio. And so we\u2019re very confident. So, our actions for the next few years continue to drive this market led strategy, drive new innovations from this segment. They are dedicated unique plans for those particular segments and continue to build-out our operations, so we can stay ahead of the demand curve as customers come in with larger volumes as we proceed forward. Bill Marsh : And on CZ and SmartDose, can you talk about maybe some type of quantification in terms of uptick in request based-on and that\u2019s used for cryogenic reason culturing reasons, or just in general uptick following a few regulatory approvals? Eric Green : Couple of areas I like to share with you. One is last couple of weeks we have --- or last week we\u2019re at a PDA Conference in California, and the interest level of conversations around our self-injection systems, we\u2019re talking about SmartDose, CZ, self-dose, is increasing because there are unique issues that our biologic customers are faced with. They talked about higher viscosity, they want to get away from silicon oil, they had issued such, especially in stem-cell therapies around cold storage. These are issues that we can help solve with this portfolio. So we have, as we mentioned in the past, we have double-digit number of development agreements with self-injection systems where we have a number of customer conversations that are a handful at this point to have surfaced since the releases of inlogic. And we are also seeing the increase in customer engagements around the technology assessment, which is very important. That\u2019s a precursor before you get into these agreements. So, we are very encouraged. And the level of engagements we have with most of the top companies developing biologics across multiple drug delivery modalities is very favorable at this point Bill. Bill Marsh : And then I just have one more for Bill. Bill if you could, in terms of the headwinds from the yen, it looks like that doesn\u2019t dissipate until about 2Q next year. So, is that something to think about a little bit on gross margins as we look at 2017? And then on the share repurchase. Should we expect that to be completed by year end? Thanks guys, have a good day. Bill Federici : So yes, the impact to the yen will continue as we continue to buy materials denominating in yen. Just to remind everyone that 2016 guidance does include that impact for Q4. But you are absolutely right it will impact us at least through the first part of 2017. And on your last point, yes, we fully expect to continue the Board authorized share repurchase program through the end of the year. Operator : [Operator Instruction] And our next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dave Windley : I guess my first question is, just curiosity about the long-term forecasting and the change in framework from rolling out a year versus reaffirming what you rolled out last year. And how are you thinking about that and how we should take your longer term confidence in that outlook? Eric Green : When you look at the outlook, I know historically, we have provided five years at West. Last year, we launched a pretty significant focus on a new strategic plan, and driving the organization to be more market led. And with initiatives we put in place, we are seeing very strong traction. I believe it's important for us as an organization to at least stay focused on what we\u2019ve communicated in regards to our 2020 targets. And so as we stand today, we believe, based on the market trends, based on the adoption of our new products, and the strength of our high-value product portfolio, the adoption towards more high quality has given us increased confidence that our 2020 targets are continue to go for, all includes in West. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on. When things do change overtime in next few years we will continue to update as we talked about, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on right now in 2020. Dave Windley : And so then within that, it seems like as we\u2019ve compared performance against some of the plans that go back further in history. The Company's performance has tended to run below the targets. I think largely because of the timing around some of the harder to predict elements, like CZ and SmartDose. Is it right to think that perhaps what I think as the steady core business, the components part of the business, maybe the contract manufacturing part of business, runs you toward the low-end of the overall range? And then CZ and SmartDose, those are more inflection driven and would drive you up into or through that range; one, is that the right way to -- is that the way you guys think about it; and then secondly, could you elaborate on how you see that inflection progressing over the next four years? Eric Green : I think when you take a look at our targets and their comfort levels of -- if you\u2019ve historically -- you are right, there has been some adjustments. But I would say majority of that has been around FX. And there is more -- the worst question about adoption of CZ and SmartDose, which is a really in the hands of our customers and moving to commercial state. But saying that, if you look at where we are today and we are seeing the increased focus around the generic and the biologics with this new dedicated market led focus of the four segments. We believe the penetration -- there is little more acceleration in there that we anticipated. So, we do believe that the way that was structured, they\u2019re focused, is driving the high value products portfolio faster than we\u2019ve seen in the past. And frankly that\u2019s a bigger base today. So, that\u2019s a very strong positive. I think Bill do you want to comment on for cadence. Bill Federici : So, Dave, it's absolutely the way that you\u2019re thinking about it is correct. We expect the near-term of that time period between now and the end of 2020 to be driven a lot more by the high-value products. And its continued growth driven as Eric said by biologics and generics. There is an inflection point in the curve. Eric also mentioned that we do not control over the timing over that. That\u2019s customers controlling the timing. But we are encouraged by the amount of activity that we have in both CZ and SmartDose across the entire portfolio. We have this idea about the primary drug container being integrated into a delivery system to create an entire unique delivery system for the customer is something that resonates with our customers. And we believe that will continue to drive strong growth going forward. But in terms of exact timing of when that inflection point is, we do not control that. And just to reminder, in the 2020 numbers, we don\u2019t have a huge amount of CZ and SmartDose in there. Dave Windley : Bill, do you quantify that, or is that something that\u2019s [multiple speakers]... Bill Federici : We did say, as we said. We\u2019ve got $100 million base approximately of proprietary devices today mostly with the administration systems, the reconstitution devices, are the biggest part of that today. And we expect that to grow very solid as we go through the time period. We have not put official number on the CZ and SmartDose in 2020, but the $200 million band -- $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion does anticipate that a lot of that band is due to CZ and SmartDose. So, the uptick of CZ and SmartDose roughly equates to that band. Operator : And our next question is from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Just a quick commentary on the 2020 versus your five year target, I actually think if I may that probably just as more important that you actually have some increased confidence in your 2020 versus putting out of 2021. Because I know that originally the five-year targets were put in play, 2012 or \u201913, just a sort of get people an idea about how much upfront spending it will take to get to these numbers, so just a little commentary from me and just on the high value products -- actually on the proprietary products and the backlog sort of now coming down significantly. Do you think that you\u2019ve gotten rid of most of the access lead-time, if you will? And obviously you\u2019ve done a great job on the manufacturing and throughput side, and we sort of see this backlog maybe stabilize for a while than continue to grow upwards? Eric Green : First of all, your first comment, I want to thank you for that. I appreciate for that comment. Secondly is as we move to backlog, you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve worked very hard over the last 12 months to really debottleneck some of our operations, and particularly up until [indiscernible] in Pennsylvania. And the team did a great job. And I think we\u2019ve normalized and stabilized our lead-times to customers. There is, when you look at the benefit of that is now we have the ability, customers that want to convert from standard packaging to high value products will see the lead-times are more acceptable. So we think the conversations with customer to be more favorable. They will continue to see the demand continue to grow nicely with the high value products. But I also believe that as we look at the demand that\u2019s coming in and the conversations we are having specifically on the biologics and the generics remains robust. I just want to remind you though that in the generics that when they come in, they convert from standard packaging to whether it\u2019s less RS or less RU. We want millions of components. And because they were very short window of opportunity to get into the market with the generics, we have to respond quickly. So, we\u2019re positioned really well now. So, handle those customers with requests, but it does become little lumpy from quarter-over-quarter. Larry Solow : And just more color, you mentioned some significant approvals on the CZ side. Is that most of the stuff we have already heard about, or were there any incrementals over the last quarter on the approval side on the launch? Eric Green : It\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve been communicating over the last -- more recently and yes that\u2019s correct. Operator : And our next question is from Arnie Ursaner, Private Investor. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : First, just on the contract manufacturing side do you -- highlighted that you\u2019ve got quite a bit of expanded tooling, which has impacted margins. But perhaps you want to also focus on the fact that tooling is usually a very good lead indicator of future opportunities for you? Eric Green : That\u2019s absolutely correct. In contract manufacturing as you know, we work side-by-side with customers, with specifically devices, and when we are investing with our customer in these new facilities, new equipments to manufacture high volumes through our plant. It does take a few quarters to get through. And those revenues are challenging in regards to the margins. During the tooling phase that it scale up and get into commercial phase, it goes actually well. We\u2019ve typically seen the commercial and for the contract manufacturing business unit. So that is correct, Arnie. Unidentified Analyst : So you should see a pretty nice improvement in the margin next year as is just from tooling to outright manufacturing? Eric Green : We\u2019ll see an incremental improvement in contract manufacturing into next year. And then I just want remind you that about third of that business is consumer goods, which is somewhat soft in that segment. And while the pharma and med device diagnostic space is pretty robust. So, we see that continued trend and that\u2019s where our team is focused at this point. Unidentified Analyst : At this time of the year, typically you have a number of your more sizable multiyear contracts that come up for renewal. Could you comment on that? And given all the volatility in oil and raw materials, how you expect that to impact your pricing going forward? Eric Green : Right now, just quickly Arnie, on agreements. As you\u2019re right, we\u2019re growing throughout the year. We continuously have conversations with customers. There has been really no change in cadence and how we have those conversations. And so we don\u2019t expect any variation up or down based on what we\u2019re seeing with our agreements. Bill, do you want to comment real quick on the raw materials? Bill Federici : Raw material prices continued to behave -- you know that our main component of our rubber formulations is a derivative of oil. And oil prices have ticked up a little bit during the year, but not tremendously. So, we don\u2019t see any measure surprise. And we don\u2019t believe that there will be any major change in the price of oil into the foreseeable future. The Japanese yen purchases raw materials are an issue and we\u2019ll continue to do so into 2017. Unidentified Analyst : Two more real quick ones, if I can. You have been asked several times about the five year shifting to four year reiteration. My recollection was your compensation on the long-term incentive plan used to be driven by the five-year plan. Did that changed in the last year or so? Eric Green : No, Arnie, that\u2019s still consistent. And we are looking at three year CAGR on revenue and ROAC targets while three year out for our long-term incentive plan, that\u2019s correct. Unidentified Analyst : And my final question, I know, you\u2019re constricted by a lot of agreements with what you can say about actual individual drugs that are in development or where your products are embedded in the system. But maybe in total you could speak about the number of drugs that have been approved using either SmartDose or CZ, or alternatively the numbers that are in Phase 3 testing, because that will drive your growth for '17, '18 and well beyond. Maybe you could help us find the total on those? Eric Green : Yes, Arnie, you are right. In terms of what has been approved and what we\u2019ve communicated, there are three modalities of CZ that\u2019s been approved now in the commercial markets. And I would say in the last quarter we have the announcement apparently with Amgen on the SmartDose. In regards to the pipeline, we can't give granularity. We do not give granularity on what's in the pipeline. But at this point we do have, as I mentioned earlier, we have double-digits number of development agreements in regards to our self-injection systems. And in that we\u2019ll continue to see interest in the CZ platform. Unidentified Analyst : And your facility in Arizona will be able to handle the volume if you get the demand, are you... Eric Green : That\u2019s correct. The facility has been approved, and it's been honoured it, and we are actually manufacturing SmartDose devices out of Arizona today. We are able to handle demand requirements over the next couple of years. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Just real quickly on obviously the whole high-value product portfolios continue to expand. Just any particular color just on some of your two newer more comprehensive offerings, particularly NovaPure, which helps the client throughout the process and maybe with the acceleration approvals from some of these smaller companies that may need this more any thoughts on that, and how trends are going there? Thanks. Eric Green : Larry, the trend on NovaPure, the whole portfolio is very positive. In fact the thesis around that was around quality by design and we\u2019re seeing that, the adoption. You\u2019re right Virgin Biotech has been very interested because of the documentation trail and capabilities to provide the highest grade product in this space. Well often to know -- I do mentioned that, we\u2019re also seeing the interest in uptick with our large biotech customers. So that\u2019s not just only emerging biotech play, but it's also been adopted by our larger customers. It's early stages, and as you are seeing with the high value product portfolio. But that\u2019s the strength of the portfolio and the focus around innovation and technology. They are looking at continuously expanding new innovative products into these portfolios of high value products and continuously reacting to our customers\u2019 needs. Operator : And our next question is from Dana Walker with Kalmar Investments. Your line is now open. Dana Walker : Could you gentlemen talk about, aside from CZ, what you buy that is yen denominated? Eric Green : So, we have a partnership with Daikyo. And we represent we have -- and this is a 40 plus year old relationship, very strong relationship. We represent some of their components outside of Japan, in the Japanese market. So, when we work with customers, we obviously have the West portfolio. But the Daikyo complements quite nicely and we are working with our customers and delivering the Daikyo components to our customers. So, you\u2019re right, outside of the CZ arena. Bill Federici : And we also have -- we buy rubber components from Daikyo the floor tech stock, et cetera. So, there is both of raw material component and a representing Daikyo from a sales perspective. Dana Walker : Do you have any ability with either -- I presume what we need to be customer arrangement to where you can true-up the economics for you. Or do you just have to take it as is? Bill Federici : We don\u2019t talk about the individual customer agreements, Dana. But what we try to do in that regard is we will try to hedge some of our exposure through the normal hedging activities that we have for transactional exposures, like we do on the euro and some of the other things we have. Dana Walker : But hedging would more smooth reality rather than try to comport reality to an economic margin based on a change in procurement price? Bill Federici : And as you know, currency fluctuate Dana, a few years ago we were benefiting from the yen. Now we happen in the third quarter, we took it really on the chin and looks like the fourth quarter will be the same as I said $0.03 impact is expected in the fourth quarter. But, no, we understand your comments and we take it into our guidance, and that\u2019s about what we can do. Dana Walker : And an update on some of the megatrends that have been helping injectable products and how they\u2019re touching you like with vaccines and diabetes care as for instance? Eric Green : Dana, one of the big drivers is around the biologics space. And if you look at, first of all, hearing from our customers but also available data, such as offered by the IMS, we really focused on the volume component, not the end sales of the drug in the marketplace. And what we\u2019re seeing is the volume increase in biologic drug is around high single-digits. And the outlook is still remains very positive. So, again this is all about the uptick on higher quality materials that are used to contain biologics and for Ministry of Injectable Medicines. I think in the generic space, we\u2019re seeing a positive trend to more branded drugs that would be going into generic space. And because of the speed of the markets and that trend and also there is higher degree of quality requirements from the FDA and other regulatory bodies, that we play very nicely with our high-value product portfolio. So, the market trends really haven\u2019t changed from last year when we talked, it's playing out as we anticipated. Dana Walker : So like diabetes and the increased use of vaccines. So, we\u2019re subtext drivers to West demand profile. Would you say that that continues to be so or are they moderating in the rated growth? Eric Green : Dana, I think you\u2019re right. The diabetes market is always looking at new innovations. First of all, we are currently working with the diabetes market major players from two angles. One is, in our core business with the high value products, some of the elastomers and steel, but also with the delivery devices that are yet owned by the diabetes companies. We remain actually with contract manufacturing business. So we are positioned well in that area. And as new innovations present themselves, we\u2019re also very well positioned from both front, one contract manufacturing but also with the primary container of the drugs. Dana Walker : Final question relates to Ireland. One presumes that when you open in Ireland, that your currency matching in having euro based costs to service euro based revenue will rise. So that your sensitivity to changes in the euro will become more translational rather than transactional, and it will be less translational than they were. Bill Federici : Not sure that I agree 100%. Dana, I understand what you\u2019re saying. We will increase now the activity in Ireland. We have sales out, none of the activity today. That activity will be naturally hedged as you said a lot of the costs and the revenues will be in euros. There will be a translation impact as we bring those local currencies back into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Dana Walker : I wanted to be corrected. It feels good. Eric Green : Thanks Dana. Quintin Lai : Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator : Our final question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dave Windley : I wanted to follow-up on some of the growth trends in your release, and I\u2019m sure you talked about in prepared remarks. But organic proprietary product growth in the 11.5% range and then you detail out by in-customer segment. Two of those three are below 11.5%. So I\u2019m inferring that your biologics market growth that double-digit is a humble way to describe growth. And it must be at least high-teens. Is that fair, first of all? Eric Green : I think, Dave, when you take a look at year-to-date, let\u2019s start with the year-to-date number. Both biologics and generics are in the mid-to-high teens. And so that has been driving the year-to-date performance. Quarter-to-quarter is does fluctuate a little more in the generic space. But we do see some fluctuations. I think when you look at Q3, in specific, biologics was very strong and generics was in the high singles. So, you can see the math how that works. Dave Windley : So appreciate that\u2019s moving, so kind of think of those as mid to high teens year-to-date, and I guess you\u2019ve little bit better sense of trend. And then on two part here two part thought process. High value product offerings growing 25% in the quarter, which is really strong certainly congratulations on that, and even a little acceleration from 2Q, I believe. And I guess, I was wondering how we should think about the incremental margin benefit from that. It didn\u2019t look to be quite as much as maybe you\u2019ve seen in the past, or as much as I might have calculated. Is that a function of maybe some of the currency headwinds that are mitigating that, or what might be other factors that I should take into account? Eric Green : Dave, sort of the couple components, one is just to reiterate. We did have our typical seasonal shutdown but we did it last year, so it's not in much variation, that\u2019s very good point there. And you talked about absorption and utilization. But when you look at excluding the impact of the FX transaction exposure, particularly when you look at the yen, our consolidated gross margin expansion would have been 180 basis-points versus the 70 basis-points that we reported. So this is a prime example when you look at the leverage that we can achieve when we have strong HPP adoption and sales growth. Operator : And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference over Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you everyone for participating on the call. An online broadcast, archive of the broadcast, will be available on our Web site here later today. It's also available to dial in through Thursday, November 3rd, and the call information is in the press release. Thank you and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Quinton. And good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. A little more than one year ago, we announced a realigned organizational structure to better support our market led strategy. We did this to heighten our focus on becoming the leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines. We shared with you that this looks to be a long-term journey to feel growth and profits for West. And I'm pleased to say we are well on our way. We delivered a strong set of results in 2016 and we are poised to continue this growth in 2017. To recap for you we've reorganized our company into three major groups. Commercial, global operations, and innovation and technology. Within the commercial team, we created two segments proprietary products and contract manufactured products. To ensure alignment with our customers in addressing the specific needs of each, we created the pharma, generic and biologics market units. We transitioned away from a regionally focused operation to a globally managed network, expanding capacity and significantly reducing delivery lead times of critical high value products. At the same time, we raise the bar on our already industry leading quality metrics and increased our focus on operational efficiencies which has allowed us to better address the demand of our worldwide customer base. Under our newly formed innovation and technology team, we continue to build momentum by adding new high-value products to our components business, while achieving milestones successes with customer FDA approvals of drug using Crystal Zenith and SmartDose technologies. And through all of this transition, we continue to meet our long-term financial objectives. We ended the year with over 9% organic sales growth, which is above our long-term target of 6% to 8%. We expanded both growth and adjusted operating profit margins and generated strong 19% adjusted diluted EPS despite having a $0.04 FX headwind. Turning to Slide 4, when we look at the growth rates over the past year 2016 stands out as being an impressive year for both organic sales and adjusted EPS growth. We are pleased with our track record of creating incremental shareholder value year-over-year. Today we are laser focused on executing our long-term strategy, which should enable future growth at the same pace. Turning to Slide 5, looking at the year the proprietary products segment represented 79% of total sales with organic sales growth just under 10%. This segment was led by double-digit organic sales growth in biologic and generics market units, with mid-single digit growth in our pharma market unit. Organic sales growth of high valued products was 20% for the year. Our market leading position remains strong, as we achieve 90% participation on all of the new injectable drugs approved by the FDA in 2016. Our end markets remain stable and growing. Demand from our biologics customers was strong and steady throughout the year, as we continue to see demand from both large biologics and emerging biologics customers. Generics growth for the year was solid with exceptionally strong sales in the first half of the year, offset by a weaker Q4 as some of our large customers manage their inventory in response to our successful reduction in lead-time. Some of our generics customers placed very large volume orders, which can cause quarter-to-quarter variability. We believe on a 12-months rolling average these variability's typically even-out. When we look at our smaller generics customers which is over half of the market unit sales we have seen a much steadier growth pattern of high single to low double-digits. Pharma, which represents some of the largest and most mature customers delivered steady mid-single digit growth throughout the year. We see continued opportunities to migrate our Pharma customers from standard component to high value products and we are seeing good traction and synergies between our components business and contract manufacturing. Our contract manufacturing business which represented 21% of our total sales grew organically mid-single digit with double-digit growth in Q4, much of the Q4 outperformance is related to tooling sales as we are adding equipment on behalf of our customers and ahead of meaningful high volume campaign that will begin later this year. The typical tie between installing tooling equipment and commercial volumes is about 12 months to 18 months which makes us optimistic about accelerating growth for contract manufacturing as 2017 progresses. Turning to global operations on Slide 6. The team has had a number of successes in 2016, recall that our backlog had risen to approximately $450 million in Q1, because we\u2019re capacity constrained for certain high value product lines. Due to our global operations focus our lead times to continued its improvement, the team increased operational efficiency and effectively added capacity to our network. As we ended the year, the backlog has come down to $373 million, an 8% decline at constant currency from 2015 year-end levels. Another area of success has come from the creation of a global supply chain and procurement organization, which is driving cost savings across the business and stronger management of our global supply base. At the same time, we continue to reinvest in our business for future growth. We recently completed and commissioned a 60,000 square foot expansion of our Dublin, Ireland contract manufacturing facility on time and within budget. I attended the opening in Dublin and was pleased to hear directly from customers how important the facility will be in helping them prepare for their product launches. Commercial production at Dublin has already begun and will ramp up throughout 2017. And we remain on schedule with the first phase of our Waterford Ireland site, which will manufacture insulin rubber sheeting. Additionally, we continue to build out high value product capacities in our other two centers of excellence in Kingston, North Carolina and in Singapore. Turning to Slide 7. 2016 was a year of new product launches by our innovation and technology team. Many of these were highlighted during the year, this is a good time to remind you that like many R&D projects, these are the results of years of work behind the scenes. Because our products are used in various medical application, we conduct extensive and time consuming testing and validation before any product is launched. Turning to Slide 8. This is a snapshot of our innovation and technology pipeline. While we often talk about CZ and SmartDose, the innovation and technology team is working on numerous project that will enhance our entire portfolio with new innovation and product line extensions to address customer need. On Slide 9. We have outlined our full year 2017 outlook. In October of last year, we set initial 2017 organic sales growth guidance to be at the high-end of our long-term range of 6% to 8%. With solid markets fundamentals, we are raising our 2017 organic sales growth outlook to a new range of 7% to 9%. As we have noted, we expect strong double-digit high-value product growth. In generics, we expect safely stock reduction to dissipate in the first half, with an acceleration in the second half resulting in the high-single to low double-digit growth for the full-year. Finally, we also expect a shift of sales from tooling to commercial product and contract manufacturing as the year progresses. We anticipate another year of strong gross margin expansion with R&D and SG&A providing an additional leverage. Resulting in adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $2.45 to $2.57. This represents a 12% to 18% year-over-year growth and includes a $0.05 to $0.07 EPS headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding this impact EPS is anticipated to grow 15% to 21% which is twice our anticipated organic sales growth.  Now, I'll turn it over to Bill Federici, who will provide more color on our financial performance. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. We issued our fourth quarter results this morning, excluding the effects of special items from both periods, fourth quarter 2016 earnings was $0.54 per diluted share which is the $0.47 we earned in Q4 of '15. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided on Slide 16 through 19. Turning to sales, Slide 11 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. All references to sales amounts are to constant currency. Consolidated fourth quarter sales were $382.3 million, an increase of 7.7% over fourth quarters 2015 sales. Proprietary product sales were $290 million, a 6.5% increase over the same quarter of '15. A favorable sales mix and volume growth accounted for 6% percentage points of the increase modestly higher selling prices contributed to the remainder of the increase. High value product sales increased 14% versus the prior year quarter. For the full-year 2016 high value product sales increased approximately 20% versus 2015. Combined CZ and SmartDose sales and development activity were $27 million for full-year 2016, a 10% increases versus the prior year. Contract manufacturing product sales were 92.4 million, an 11.6% increase over the sales in the prior year quarter due to higher drug delivery and diagnostic product sales including increase in lower margin tooling revenues. As provided on Slide 12, our Q4 2016 consolidated gross profit margin was 32.3% versus the 33.3% margin we achieved in the first quarter of '15. Proprietary products fourth quarter gross margin of 36.9% is 0.4 margin points lower than the 37.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of '15. A favorable mix of products sold, modest sales price increases and continuing savings and plant efficiencies were more than offset by the impact of higher general inflationary cost, yen denominated material purchases which had an unfavorable impact at 2.2 million or $0.02 EPS headwind in the quarter, and facility startup cost, contract manufacture product fourth quarter gross margin of 17.6% was 2.2 margin points lower than the prior year quarter due to an unfavorable sales mix mainly from incremental low margin tooling sales and unabsorbed overhead, especially in our recently concluded Dublin manufacturing facility. As reflected on Slide 13, Q4 2016 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 1.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease is due primarily to low achievement levels on incentive comp programs offset by staffing increases and high stock compensation cost. As a percentage of sales, Q4 2016 SG&A expense was 1.5 percentage points less than the prior year period. Slide 14 shows our key cash flow metrics, operating cash flow was 290 million for the full year of '16, 7 million more than 2015 due primarily to our strong operating results, offset by higher working capital requirements. Capital additions of roughly 170 million were mainly in 2015, roughly 60% of the capital spend is on new products and expansion efforts, including approximately 55 million in Waterford and 20 million for our recently completed Dublin contract manufacturing facility. We expect capital additions of between 150 million and 175 million in 2017, including approximately 60 million of cost associated with the new Waterford facility. Slide 14 also provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we\u2019re confident that our business will provide the necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at year-end was $203 million, 72 million lower than our December '15 balance, roughly 50% of that cash is invested overseas and is generally not available for repatriation without tax consequences. The lower cash balance reflects the payment at maturity of our Euro B notes in February of '16. Debt at year-end was $229 million, 70 million less than at prior year-end, due to the payment at maturity of our Euro B notes. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at year-end was 2.2%, approximately the same as in the prior yearend ratio. Working capital total 401 million at yearend, 41 million higher than the prior yearend due to increases in receivables and inventory balances reflecting our growing business. Our backlog of committed orders was 373 million as of December '16, which is approximately 8% lower than our December '15 balances, excluding exchange due to the actions taken to increase capacity and throughput reducing plant lead times and relieving the backlog. We have issued our full year 2017 guidance in this morning's release. That guidance to summarized on Slide 15. Our guidance is based on an exchange rate of $1.05 per Euro. Our actual 2016 results translated at $1.11 per Euro rate. The exchange rates will likely continue to be a headwind throughout 2017 due to the strengthening in U.S. dollar versus other currencies. Currency volatility in Asian and emerging market is expected to add headwinds for the business in 2017. We expect our 2017 effective tax rate to remain at approximately 29%. Our tax rate is highly dependent on the geographic mix of earnings, which driven by the sales of high value products has been migrating towards higher tax rate jurisdictions like the U.S. which has an adverse effect on our tax rate. Our 2017 guidance includes a $0.02 EPS benefit resulting from our previously announced 800,000 share repurchase plans. We expand our Q1 2017 margins will continue to be adversely impacted by the effect of currencies including the Venezuelan bolivar, Brazilian riyal, the Euro and the Japanese Yen, customer employ management and plant startup costs. We expect a resulting Q1 consolidated operating profit margin of approximately 14.8% to 15%. All of these factors are included in our full year 2017 guidance. The growth accelerating throughout 2017 in our generics and contract manufacturing market units, we expect a stronger second half of 2017 compared to the first half. We expect to deliver on our full-year 2017 earnings guidance of $2.45 to $2.57 per diluted share which on a constant currency basis represents an increase of between 15% and 21% in diluted EPS over 2016. I now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great, thank you Bill. In conclusion, we delivered a strong set of results and made significant progress in executing the first year of our long-term market led strategy. Our commercial team continues to make deeper in-roads with the discreet customer groups we have targeted. Our global operations team has a roadmap to improve quality, safety, service and cost. And our innovation and technology team is building a strong pipeline of integrated containment and delivering products to meet customer needs. For this reasons we believe the future looks bright, and we will continue to deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders.  Candice, we are ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Can you go over the exact organic growth, excuse me, starting with FX could you give me the impact for FY '16 total and kind of where your thoughts again are on the potential impact on '17? Bill Federici : So for '16 Paul, for the full-year the FX was a $0.04 negative hit to us. For 2017 we expect we'll seeing continued headwinds from currencies. The euro has declined as dollar strengthens against that and against Asian and South American currency. So we expect to see a $0.05 to $0.07 reduction adverse headwinds from currency in 2017. Paul Knight : And then your Op margin the guidance for Q1 was what Bill? Bill Federici : 14.8% to 15% and that's consolidated operating profit margin. Paul Knight : And then lastly regarding Ireland, when -- will we see any revenue contribution from net of capacity expansion here in 2017? Eric Green : Yes, in regards to Waterford, in the Phase I of the insulin sheeting we are in process towards the end of 2017 to validate with our customers and the commercial revenues will be observed in the first part of 2018. On the Dublin contract manufacturing facilities, we have started up and we\u2019ll start seeing commercial revenues ramp up throughout the year for our industry customers. Paul Knight : And then Eric, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing with projects in Phase III or projects Crystal Zenith, tone of market for your proprietary product line? Eric Green : Yeah. Paul, there is really two ways of looking at it, one is start with the high value products portfolio, on our last commercial sales. We continue to see very healthy conversion going from standard packaging up to high value products and addition too we\u2019re seeing new molecules which is exhibited in 2016 injectable drugs that were approved were around 90% of those. And so we\u2019re seeing a very nice uptake continuing in our high value products. That said, the innovation team is continued to expand the portfolio and raising the capabilities to new formulas, new processing technology to raise the quality standards, which obviously bodes well with our customers today. When we look at on the CZ and SmartDose, or in self-injection devices, we\u2019ve seen in bulk situations of both of those product lines, an increase of number of developments. So in SmartDose there is a slight increase on the number of developments with customers and there is more conversations going on today than we\u2019ve had over a year ago. And then on the CZ there is an increase on formal stability. So, we\u2019re still very pleased with the progress, although its timing with our customers, we still see those two platforms very strong viable growth long-term. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Sarah Silverman : Hi, this is Sarah Silverman on for Tim. Just a couple of for you guys. I want the follow-up on the FX guidance. We have tried to model the FX impact on EPS pretty carefully for 2017, but it still looks like we kind of under called the headwind. Can you help us understand the FX mix in your cost base, particularly a little more details on the yen, euro, and then any of those other currencies that are pretty impactful? Bill Federici : Sure. So, Sarah the euro versus dollar, everybody knows that one. When we talked to you last year at the end of October, it was hovering right around above $1.10 per Euro. Now, we\u2019ve guided here for the full year our view of it is that at leading at $1.05. Now obviously, that will change, but we had to put a stake in the ground somewhat, so we put it at $1.05 per Euro. On the other pieces of the puzzle, certainly in Asia, where we sell at our Singapore facility in both dollars and euros we\u2019re seeing the impact of the strengthening dollar there as well. And in South America we're seeing the volatility of those currencies continue and that will continue to provide a headwind for us. In addition to the fact that we still have an investment in Venezuela and we noted the situation there, should there be another official devaluation, we have an exposure of somewhere between $5 million and $7 million depending on what they devalue the business too. So, those are the primary drivers there, I mean there is a lot involved in this obviously, as we are very global business with operations all over the place, but that is for the primary drivers. Sarah Silverman : Okay. In terms of like percent of your cost base, do you have an idea of like how much is Euros how much is Yen? Bill Federici : I could give you on the sales and then you can convert that, but it's not perfect. So on the sales for 2016 we were 40% basically Euro based and Asian and Latin and South American businesses we're [technical difficulty] magnitude 10%. Sarah Silverman : Okay. And then just another one on guidance. You guys took up your constant currency revenue growth guidance. Can you elaborate on the factors that give you confidence around that to raise the guidance this early in the year, kind of considering it's a bit second half loaded? Eric Green : Sarah, we take a look at what we have accomplished in 2016, looking at the pending order list that we have with our customers and also the investments we made in certain parts of our business we feel really strong with the 7% to 9%, to dimension that's a little bit, our pharma business we believe that we'll continue with mid-single growth as in -- obviously, we delivered that in '16. In the generics business, while there is some lumpiness with their top customers and I mentioned earlier that smaller customers on generics are lower than 50%, but really about third of our business are five large generics and we have clear visibility on their stocking and they are actually moving up to high value product curve and the strength of our operations reducing lead times by 2x has given the top and continues to stay high single low double in that business. Biologics, we have seen continued strength around double-digit consistently. And then contract manufacturing is one that in 2016, we are about mid-single, but with the investments we made we are ramping up to the high-single throughout 2017. And if you add all that up, it's between that, we're very comfortable with the 7% to 9% organic. Sarah Silverman : Okay, and just to clarify, if you had to pin point what kind of pushed the needle from October to say now, like would you pin point one thing or is it generally broader growth than you had previously anticipated? Bill Federici : Yes, I would say one is the uptake on the conversations we're having with the generic, and as we talk about our innovation platform, we're already looking at potentially new formulas for them that will allow us to compete more on the high value products and do the switching. So it's a little bit a type of comp, that's the difference between I'd say in October then what we are today. Sarah Silverman : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Just a couple quick follow-ups. Which is on the backend loaded outlook, obviously backlog was down 8% I guess year-over-year and that's obviously, with regards to your motivation what you want to do. So clearly that was a little bit higher. You mentioned some customer change in order patterns, inventory patterns. Is that sort of part of the reason for the back ended loaded outlook? Maybe you expect some adjustment, I know you has of adjusted in your generics customers this quarter. It looks like you expect some of that to happen on the biologics side as well? Eric Green : Yes, when we look back in Q4 we knew -- talking with our generic customers, we knew that because of the success we have with reduced lead times, that there was going to be a reduction on their safety stock in their own manufacturing facility. And therefore, we have that anticipated and really first half of 2017. But was brought forward a little bit earlier than we anticipated in the later part of Q4. So that is one of the drivers that we see as a reason why you're seeing stronger growth in the second half of 2017 than the first half. The other is, as we mentioned early about the contract manufacturing, some of the investments we made in the tooling and getting our sites up and running are in the ramp up phase at this point. And that\u2019s what bring in in the mid-single to the high-single and again a lot of that's borne in the back half of the year. Larry Solow : Got it. And then just -- and you mentioned tooling and the investments in that side of the business. Just in terms of gross margin, obviously, your outlook is for pretty nice improvement 120 to 160. So, it looks like '16 was little more impact than we though, particularly in Q4 from some of the startup costs. The improvement going forward, it sounds like -- and you continue to get the expansion from the better mix and then I guess your conversion to more of a commercial from the tooling and lower I guess startup costs. So those are sort of the factors that will draw the expansion this year? Eric Green : Yeah. Larry, absolutely two things. One is, since they're on contract manufacturing, is that, we anticipate lower levels of tooling revenues in '17 than we did in '16, that was a little bit unusually higher for us, though mostly in the Q4 timeframe. I think also with the ramp up we have with our generics and moving more towards the high value products, as you know our high value products or almost 2x on the gross margin than our standard projects. And we still see very strong double-digit growth in high value products and that\u2019s a major drive of this shift. Bill, you want to add some color to that? Bill Federici : Yeah. On the contract manufacturing side Larry, the tooling revenues are very, very low margin as you suggested. So that mix shift from -- but the good news is, it\u2019s a poor shadowing of commercial business coming through on contract manufacturing. Those customers are ready, we\u2019re starting to provide them product. So Q1, starting in Q1 and going through 2017, we'll be replacing tooling revenues with good margin revenues in contract manufacturing. So, yes it did absolutely hurt us, that tooling piece was about 6.5 million of extra tooling revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, which hurt us to a tune of 1.2 margin point in contract manufacturing. So, we expect it to be the mix shift and as it starts to come with those new customers to really bring us up on the margin scale for contract manufacturing throughout the 2017. Larry Solow : Got you. And it looks like price helped you benefit, you guys benefited a little bit on the quarter about 0.5% or so. What was the benefit for the full year and going forward, do you expect maybe the benefits to increase on pricing front? Eric Green : Larry, we historically in the last several years have been roughly around 1% price contribution in our business. I would say '16 it was slightly less than that, and at this point and as we looked into '17, we believe we\u2019ll still continue to be around that 1% plus or minus slightly. But, not a significant deviation from what we\u2019ve seen over the last two years or three years. Larry Solow : Got you. The CZ, SmartDose total numbers did you say that was 27 million? Bill Federici : 27 million Larry, yes. About 10% increase on a constant currency basis over 2016. Larry Solow : Got it. It was sort of closer to flat I guess on a reported basis or? Bill Federici : On a reported basis it's flat, but when you take out currency it's about 10% up. Larry Solow : Okay, and then the so I guess sort of -- I know we have expected some significant decent amount more growth, obviously it's a small number, so the percentages get a little skewed, but was that slower on the SmartDose side, CZ side, both any color there would be great. Eric Green : So it's two elements, one is the development agreements that we were working on and later prior to 2016 are looking to implement more in the early 2017 timeframe. The second is around commercial ramp up working with our customers and we have pretty clear line of sight. But that is some push more into early '17 than late '16. So those are the two elements that really drove that 10% growth versus a little bit higher than we anticipated. Larry Solow : So it sounds like more timing than anything else? Eric Green : Yes, Larry it's a timing factor. Larry Solow : Great. And then just lastly on the tax rate. Obviously, hovering slowly creeping up towards 29%. Sort of a high-class problem. But as you look out going forward, excluding any potential corporate tax overhaul in the U.S. nothings [ph] happen there, but as you shift more into Ireland and whatnot do you expect this rate to maybe at least stop going up and then over time hopefully coming down a little bit? Bill Federici : Absolutely, Larry. But you got to be patient with these things. As you know our business, we are not expecting any real growth coming out Waterford in 2017, really doesn\u2019t start commercial until early part [technical difficulty]. We'll get some benefit out of contract manufacturing in Dublin, more activity there, more sales there. But it's at 20% margins as oppose to the high 55% high value product margins we expect out of Waterford. So, yes the answer is -- the long-term answer is, absolutely we believe if we can drive our effective tax rate south, but to be honest, in the interim as we continue to sell more and more high value products in the U.S. and other high tax jurisdiction countries there is going to be upward pressure on that rate. I don\u2019t expect it to move a lot during 2017, but I wouldn\u2019t be expecting a significant decline in 2017. Larry Solow : Got it, great. Okay, thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Derek Brown of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Juan Avendano : This is Juan Avendano on behalf of Derek. I wanted to start out, you used to provide gross margin guidance by segments, just curious as to why you stopped doing that this quarter? Eric Green : Honestly, what we're trying to do is just to provide -- be transparent and we believe this is a business, the way to business is evolving these entities, market units, it's more effective to talk about it the way we are. Juan Avendano : And the adjusted operating margins what should we expect for 2017? Just curious what the contribution maybe from any SG&A or R&D leverage? Eric Green : So I'm not clear on the question Juan, do you mean for the whole year or are you just talking regarding the we talked about Q1 and we also gave some guidance that it relates to the full-year on consolidated gross margin. Juan Avendano : I'm talking about the operating margin full-year. Eric Green : So from the leverage perspective, yes, absolutely we expect leverage to come from both SG&A and R&D. So our operating profit margin will be, expansion will be greater than our gross profit margin expansion. Juan Avendano : Okay. And my next question is on the contract sales segment. And so you\u2019re guiding for high single-digit organic growth this year. But this above your long-term outlook for the segment which is mid-single digit. Is this a 2017 only phenomenon or are you changing -- or do you still expect mid-single digit in the long-term for contract manufacturing? Eric Green : Yes, Juan. At this point, when we take a look at the business, this 2017 is really a ramp up of the investments made in '16 and just to be a little more granularity, this is really the focus on the diabetes market on delivery devices, whether it\u2019s insulin pens or even continues glucose monitoring devices. And as the ramp up phases, we\u2019ll see a higher impact on the percent growth rate in '17. We anticipate that to kind of level back to mid-single long-term as we see the markets today are slightly better than the market. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at, it's more of a '17 ramp up. Juan Avendano : Okay. Good. And one of your -- just recently at the end of last year, one of your competitors and also customers had their Analyst Day and it seems like they\u2019re focusing a lot more in the self-injection market, they plan to launch a product every year with one particular product being launched this year in the diabetes market. What opportunities or challenges does this present to West? Eric Green : Yeah. I think when we look at the diabetes market, you\u2019re right, when we look at the primary container of where we sit with our [indiscernible] business, we're basically on all the formats for the delivered devices. When it comes to the device itself, for contract manufacturing there are a number of players. Especially when you start talking about wearables, it's a very early stage at this point. But we feel good about where we are, we are a critical supplier partner with the large insulin manufactures. We also have connectivity to other firms that are looking at this space from a device perspective. So, you\u2019re right, there is a number of competitors are looking at it because of the attractive growth, but we\u2019re already in the market, we\u2019re expanding the market, we\u2019re adding new products to build support, the growth of our customers. Juan Avendano : Okay. And lastly, similar to the pricing question before based on my calculations, you got about 70 basis points of pricing of 2016 is slightly below the usual 1% typically year-over-year. Are you seeing any pressure at all given the cascading down from the biopharma direct pricing scrutiny? Eric Green : No, I would say that at this point it's pretty consistent to what we have been seeing. Obviously with products that have been in the drug market for a number of years maybe over a decade, may have more pressure on the standard packaging components. But, when we look at the high value products and the devices we obviously have continued runway to capture 1% per annum. So, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that. Juan Avendano : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. And now I\u2019d like to turn conference over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Candice and thank you for joining us on today's conference call.

I will now call -- I will now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased you could join us today for our Q1 call. We are off to a good start to 2017. In the first quarter, we generated solid organic sales growth of 8.7%, with good contributions from both segments. We expanded growth and operating profit margins in the quarter. We launched new products and increased capacity with our Dublin contract manufacturing expansion, which is now online. And we continue to invest in the future with the first phase at our Waterford Ireland facility on track to be operational and delivering validated customer samples in 2017. We generated a record high diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the quarter. Excluding the benefit from the new accounting rules for tax deductions related to stock based comp expense, we would have grown adjusted diluted EPS by 13%. On slide four, we present organic sales growth over the last five quarters. As you can see, our overall organic sales growth has been in the 8% to 10% range over this period. But when you look at the individual market units, as we previously discussed, there is more quarter-to-quarter variability. Our ability to serve these market groups despite these changes in demand demonstrates the strength of our scale and the depth of our capabilities. In aggregate, the long-term dynamics across our end markets remain robust and we are uniquely positioned to serve these diverse customer groups. Let me review our Q1 performance in the context of our end markets. Our strategy for growth remains focused on increasing the adoption rate of high-value products. We are also working to secure more opportunities for our customers to use multiple West products for each dose delivered and we see customers responding positively to the strategy. In our Pharma market unit, we had strong double-digit sales performance. The growth was a result of very strong high-value product sales, coupled with favorable year-over-year comparison due to inventory adjustments by our customers. There is also some favorable pricing adjustments made in certain regions impacted by inflation. We expect Pharma to return to more typical mid single-digit sales growth resulting in high single-digit growth for the full year. As we saw last quarter, our Generics market unit declined mid-single digits as customers continued to work out safety stock accumulated in the first half of 2016. We have improved lead times for many of our high-value products and in turn our customers have been able to reduce their inventory levels. For Generics, we expect to see increased momentum as the year goes on. We have already seen some large customers placed meaningful high value product orders for second half delivery. We expect Generics to return to high single-digit growth in the latter part of 2017, which will result in mid single-digit growth for the full year. In the Biologics market unit, we saw mid single-digit growth as we recycled against the strongest growth quarter of last year due to inventory builds in support of commercial drug launches. In this quarter, we experienced some destocking by customers, but not at the same level of Generics and we expect to return to double-digit growth in Q2 and for the remainder of the year. Importantly, commercial activity for both SmartDose and CZ remains high. We have multiple SmartDose programs at an early stage and its commercial program in place for both SmartDose and CZ. Developments for larger volume and preloaded versions of our SmartDose device platform, as well as connectivity features are raising interest from our customers, especially within our Biologics and emerging biotech customer base. In contact manufacturing, we achieved the second straight quarter of double-digit growth, along with a favorable comparison from last year's first quarter. We are seeing the results as expected from the many tooling projects which support new programs secured in the back half of 2016. Because of the longer lead times of some of these projects we have good visibility into the back half of the year, which should produce high single-digit growth in this segment. On slide five, this shows our product portfolio and represents the value we bring to our customers with the valuable of those products and services bring to West. We recognize that our long-term success depends on our ability to keep our product pipeline full of advanced containment and delivery solutions. The product shown above the arrow represents some of the new products that have recently been launched or will soon be launched. I am pleased with the progress of our global innovation and technology team, and their work to expand our portfolio. We do know it takes time for many of these products to achieve substantial commercial volumes, as our customers make their way through the drug development cycle for we are pleased with our cadence of new product launches. By working with our customers particularly during Phase 1 or 2, we are able to support them from concept to development to launch. As a result, we have seen high percentage of FDA approved injectables using either West or Daikyo components. In fact, we are pleased to report that our products are used in all five of the new biologic medicines approved by the FDA in the first quarter of this year. Most recently, I got a chance to speak with some of our top customers at the March DCAT Conference in New York. It was a great pleasure to get their feedback and how West is successfully partnering with them to get their products to the market. But I heard most frequently was how much they value and appreciate the deep technical insight their teams offer. We also noted the importance of our collaboration to continue to improve so that together we can ensure we deliver the highest quality level of each and every day. Is not just about the products we make. To hear from our customers on how much they value our scientific affairs and technical services, as well as our regulatory affairs and assistance with filings, it underscores that West is the scientific destination for integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines. We are striving to provide value at every possible touch point we have with our customers as part of our market led strategy. Turning to slide six, with a good start to the year, we remain focused on delivering critical high value products to our customers, offering differentiating contract manufacturing services and further developing our growing self-injection platforms. We are maintaining a 7% to 9% organic sales growth guidance for the year and raising our adjusted EPS guidance. I'll now turn over to our CFO, Bill Federici, who will take you through the detailed financial results for the quarter. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We issued our results this morning reporting first quarter 2017 earnings of $60.9 million or $0.81 per diluted share versus the $0.30 per diluted share we reported in the first quarter of 2016. Those results are summarized on slide seven. Our Q1 2017 reported results include a $15.9 million or $0.21 EPS tax benefit associated with our adoption of the new accounting standards regarding share-based payments. Our Q1 2016 reported results include a restructuring charge and the Venezuelan devaluation charge. Excluding those non-recurring items, our Q1 2016 adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53. Those 2016 non-GAAP measures are described in slides 13 through 16. Turning to sales, slide eight shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Consolidated first quarter sales were $387.7 million, an increase of 8.7% for the first quarter \u201816 sales, excluding translation exchange effects. Proprietary product sales increased 8% versus the same quarter 2016 excluding unfavorable translation exchange effects. Volume increases contributed 5.7% of the proprietary sales increase. Our high-value product components and system sales increased 8% versus the prior year first quarter. As expected, the quarters -- the current quarter\u2019s HVP sales were adversely impacted by customer inventory management especially in our Generics and Biologics market units. The current quarter HVP sales as a percentage of total proprietary sales were constant versus the prior year quarter and represent more than 50% of our total proprietary product Q1 2017 sales. For the full year 2017, we expect double-digit sales growth in high-value products. CZ and SmartDose sales grew double digits in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter. Contract manufactured products net sales increased by 11.4% versus the prior quarter excluding exchange, a favorable mix of products sold, volume increases and pricing drove the increase in Q1 2017 sales. This quarter\u2019s growth was favorably impacted by the ramping up of some customer\u2019s projects in our Dublin facility. We expect high single-digit sales growth in contract manufacturing for the full year 2017. As provided on slide nine, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q1 2017 was 34.6% versus the 34% margin we achieved in the first quarter of \u201916. Proprietary products first quarter gross margin of 31.2% was 40 basis points higher than the 38.8% achieved in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin is due to price increases and operational efficiencies offset by a slightly unfavorable mix of products sold and normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead costs. Our Venezuelan operations favorable currency impact in the current quarter was partially offset by growing currency losses on material purchases and an unfavorable currency translation effect in Europe. Contract manufactured products first quarter gross margin increased by 160 basis points to 16.3% compared to the prior year quarter. The current quarter's higher gross margin is primarily due to the favorable mix of products sold and operational efficiency, offset by normal material, labor and overhead costs increases. As reflected on slide 10, Q1 2017 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $3.5 million versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, first quarter 2017 SG&A expense was 15.9% versus 16% in the first quarter of \u201916. Pension costs decreased by $1 million in the quarter and were offset by higher compensation expense, including lower increases and increased IT costs. Foreign exchange had a favorable effect, reducing SG&A expenses by $400,000. Slide 11 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $20.7 million for the current quarter, $17 million more than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the higher net income and the new accounting standards classification of the excess tax benefit on share based payments as part of operating cash flows. Our capital spending was $37.5 million in the current quarter. We expect to spend approximately $150 million to $175 million in capital in 2017, more than half of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including $25 million in Waterford. Slide 11 also provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we are confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at March 31st of $169 million was $34 million less than our December 15 balance. Approximately $27 million of our cash was used to buyback 325,000 shares of our common stock under the Board authorized share buyback plan and related $20 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan. Our large portion of our cash remain invested overseas and is generally not available to repatriated to the U.S. while incurring tax consequences, we continue to pursue repatriation of certain offshore cash where possible. Debt at March 31st of $228 million is essentially the same level as at year end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter end was 4.8%. Working capital of $396 million at March 31st was $5 million lower than at year end. The majority of the decrease was due to the reduction in cash and the reclassification of long-term debt to current offset by increases in inventory and receivables relating to our growth in our business. Our committed proprietary product orders of $408 million at March 2017 were 8% higher than at year end, but 5% lower than the March 2016 orders excluding exchange. The March 2016 committed orders were impacted by our extended lead times for certain high value products. Turning to slide 12, we are increasing our full year 2017 EPS guidance range by $0.21 to reflect the Q1 excess tax benefit on stock transactions. We are reaffirming our other annual guidance provided previously. We have based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.05 per euro, the same rate used in our prior guidance. Our 2017 guidance excludes any additional impact from further currency devaluations, including the Venezuela Bol\u00edvar as the company continues to operate primarily under the official exchange rate. It also excludes the expected additional expense associated with our restructuring program. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric? Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Bill. In conclusion, we delivered a solid set of results for the first quarter of 2017. We are driving high-value product growth in our proprietary products segment and expanding our contract manufacturing services. Our global operations is driving more efficient production, higher quality and better service, delivering significant value for our customers and patients that serve. And our innovation and technology team continues to fill up product pipeline with exciting new developments in primary containment and delivery. We are off to a good start and I look forward making additional progress and executing our market led strategy in 2017. Takia, we are ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Derik DeBruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik DeBruin : Hi. Good morning. Eric Green : Good morning, Derik. Bill Federici : Good morning, Derik. Derik DeBruin : Great. So, I got just a few housekeeping questions and I got a bigger one. Bill, tax guide for 2017 is bulk of the benefit in the first quarter. How does the rest of the quarter pace out? What\u2019s the guide for the full year tax rate? Bill Federici : Full tax rate is right around 29%. Derik DeBruin : Okay. Bill Federici : It excludes -- as you know, it excludes that tax benefit that we picked up from the share based payments without the net new accounting announcement. Derik DeBruin : Got you. Bill Federici : So that\u2019s why first quarter is so low. Derik DeBruin : Got you. Okay. Great. And the topline impact from FX, you are looking for this now? Bill Federici : Well, FX is, right now we are guidance to $1.05 per euro. Derik DeBruin : Yeah. Bill Federici : Right now obviously it\u2019s a little higher than that, but we put a stake in the ground then we will continue to monitor that and report on a quarterly basis. Right now it\u2019s a headwind for us from the euro. Derik DeBruin : Got it. Okay. Share count? Bill Federici : Share count, we are hoping that remain relative flat, because we have that share buyback plan that we have -- that the board authorized and we put in place, so hoping to keep it relative flat. Derik DeBruin : Great. Second question now, could you just walk a little bit about the Biologics, I mean, you had a tough comp and you\u2019ve also seen some drawdown, you saw some drawdown in inventory, it sounds like, just talk about what you are seeing that in market and then how, where, is any out there in terms of where your customers are adopting Crystal Zenith and I will shut out? Eric Green : Yeah. Derik, good question, we look at the Biologics similar to last year where we had a period of time was little bit slightly less than the other three quarters, that\u2019s we are experiencing this year in 2017 and the markets themselves are still as far as the unit volume perspective mid to high single-digit and we expect to grow faster than that obviously, but working with our customers with the inventory management and again this leaves to the high value product focus reducing cycle times just to put dimension slightly and couple of our plants that produce mostly the high value products. We saw a nice reduction about 20 -- roughly around 20% reduction. That obviously is migrating back to our customers and there is again higher degree of confidence and therefore they are pulling back on their inventories. As we have said, we were pretty clear that we will see increase in growth rates over prior year to back to the double digits starting this quarter in Q2 and going forward. So we were feeling pretty good about that. In regards to CZ, at least we have seen a little slight increase of the interest level, when you start to looking at pre-stability -- stability and it getting ready for launch in those three buckets, we are seeing an increase which is favorable. As you know it does take time, does depend on approvals and customers getting ready for launch, but we are still feeling pretty good about that portfolio at this time. Derik DeBruin : Great. Thank you. Eric Green : Thank you, Derik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Sarah Akers : Hi. This is Sarah Akers on for Tim. I have a margin. Hi, guys. I have a margin question for you. You guys had pretty solid margin gains in the quarter and I like it came from the components. You guys call out about 100 basis points on efficiency gains but then volume and mix was bout a 30 basis points headwind. Can you guys talk about kind of what exactly you doing to gain the efficiencies and then also talk about why volume and mix was a negative contributed, so this is kind of reversal also historical turn? Eric Green : Yes, Sarah. Good morning. And let me start with the efficiencies. Last year we embarked on, as you know little over a year ago we embarked on a really a different focus around our operations, we globalized historical right up from the site and region perspective and it was -- is effected at that time but going forward we probably to bring more of a global approach. We bought leadership into the organization and frankly we are starting to see good traction and looking at how we can move certain products being produced in certain regions and are locations more effectively truly balance dollars of load. When I look at the operations there\u2019s really four key levers we are focused on. One, we are already a pretty high level on quality, but we wanted to actually move that bar even further north. The second is around service. The lead time focused on reducing it to a more than acceptable point by our customers is that we are doffing on their journey. The third one is global lean initiatives, it starting to kick in, we are going more global operations, global mean, principles, returning see early traction. And the fourth one could take little more time, but it's really the global manufacturing strategy, looking at capacity opportunities and leveraging scale. We spend, obviously, quite bit on CapEx. We are looking at how we can leverage our assets more effectively going forward this global approach. I think, Bill, you want to talk little bit about the mix effect? Bill Federici : Sure. So mix was very slightly negative and slightly unfavorable and it\u2019s directly tied to the lower growth rate in both Biologics and Generics. Sarah Akers : Okay. So we encourage you think that next year can be a positive contributor to margin? Bill Federici : Exactly. Right. So let me, return -- Biologics returning double-digit in the second quarter and then also seeing Generics ramp up by the end of the year, all of those will help with that the mix going forward. Sarah Akers : Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow up on the CZ question. You guys talked about $27 million in CZ and SmartDose last year. Do you guys expect that line to grow materially this year? Eric Green : Yeah. We expect that to grow in the double digits. Sarah Akers : Okay. Great. Thanks for my question. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Sarah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Good morning. Thanks, guys. Eric Green : Good morning, Larry. Larry Solow : Good morning. Bunch of moving parts, obviously, with timing and what not and just curious, I know we expect a little bit more of backend loaded year. Is most the difference there just a little bit of the pull forward on the contract manufacturing side or what's sort of is there or is the quarter may be little bit better than your internal outside the timing? Eric Green : Yeah. I think what we are going to see in the back half this year is more the ramp up on the Generics space. As recall that that we have a few large customers in that space that really move the needle quickly. Larry Solow : Right. Eric Green : And so, again, I am very pleased with their operations really driving down cycle times, therefore value to be a confidence, but the demand in the Generics is still rather robust, so we are pretty confidence there. In the Biologics, again, that\u2019s more of a ramp up back double digits in Q2 and beyond, so we have that effect of those two, which is about 50% of our business and most of that is our high value product portfolio. The contract manufacturing, just a quick comment, low double digits in last two quarters, we anticipate a similar type of growth going forward. However, when you look at the Q4 as far as the growth percentage is going to get a very high comp, so you should look at the contract manufacturing as a very stable predictable revenue run rate for that business, especially after investing in the facilities in Dublin. Larry Solow : Okay. And just on the contract manufacturing side, just a quick over there, I know the -- on the gross margin that segment it did increase pretty nicely year-over-year and I assumed it just time related still sort of Q1, I guess, normal is a little bit lower, it still remain sort of lower probably then your full year outlook. You had a decent rebound in growth. Is there anything else in there that sort of impact to that that should sort of weighing as the year progresses? Eric Green : Yeah. So, Larry, as you remember, we had a bunch of tooling stuff going on in the fourth quarter that has actually now produced usable capacity and that capacity is filled by our customers, so that\u2019s obviously helped to achieve with the increase in the margin. And there is also some good operational efficiency going on in there as well. So those things we continue to, as I have said, we continue to think that that\u2019s going to continue to build for the year. Larry Solow : Got it. And then, just lastly on, it sounds like you guys are receiving through your throughput and your capacity over the last three quarters, which is, I think, like a confidence in your customers and that\u2019s led to some slowdown in orders, which were probably a little bit ahead of the gain last year? Do you think what sort of gain closer to, I guess, on that equilibrium, but less volatility in the order line going forward? Eric Green : Yeah. I would say, at this point we are going to see less volatility. I think we are in a more stable state, but I will keep on challenging the applications to finally to even improve the cycle times that so that it\u2019s uniquely in a new space. So as we go forward you will see that reflected in our committed orders. We do want to keep continue to push the cycle times down to be more aligned with our customer expectations. Larry Solow : Got it. Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Eric Green : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is [ph] Jerry Megason (28:53) on for Dave this morning. Eric Green : Hi, Jerry. Unidentified Analyst : I just had a couple quick once. Can you guys elaborate little a bit more on Waterford and kind of the impact you guys expect there in 2018. I know I don't want to jump forward too much, but just curious what kind of impact this could have kind of long-term basis? Eric Green : Yeah. Well, we are in the process of at the end of this year we will be working with our customers especially in insulin space on validating samples, unless the validation process has been completed, we can start moving into commercial revenues. But as you know in this space in this business it does take lot of the ramp up, so I would argue that 2018 while we will see ramp up in commercials that can be really significant. It\u2019s going to be in light with our expectations, but in fact it will be significant hit to our topline in \u201918. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. And then just real quickly on the customer inventory management. I'm just curious kind of diving your guy\u2019s visibility on that and kind of ability to forecast? Eric Green : Well, one of the, you ask me correct, and one of the reasons why we realigned our organization to the market led. So our Generics team is just focus on the Generics customers. They are having discussions day in day out and they are working with their operations to translate that into capacity and utilization of our facilities. We are getting better at it. To improve, I think, we can. But I would say we would be in better visibility. Some of it is little bit of variability of our customers as they moving out in and out of ability to produce. Unfortunately some of our customers are going through difficult times with FDA but that translates into another location. So there is some moving parts for that business, but we are getting better visibility. I do believe we have some room for improvement. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks guys. Eric Green : Thank you. Bill Federici : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William March with Janney. Your line is open. William March : Hey, guys. This is Bill on for Paul Knight. How you guys doing? Eric Green : Good. How are you doing? Bill Federici : Thanks, Bill. William March : So first question just on the Generics business, obviously, customers have been working off of backlog over the past couple quarters, with the backlog also kind of flat year-over-year, are you starting to see more customers interested in high value products and so some of them are maybe burning off standard products to upgrade, just what are you seeing from that customer segment? Eric Green : Yeah. Bill, I wouldn\u2019t correlate that exactly to the transition from standard to high value products. There is a transition occurring and I think we have discrete cases to point to. However, what we are seeing is as the -- we have seen the momentum of new committed orders coming in, which is building on upon the backlog at this time. So as you recall, it\u2019s around 8% increase as of end of last year. Last year was the pullback in inventory is probably more the latter part. It was after we had a discussion in October -- June, October and December. We knew it\u2019s going to be probably good six months -- roughly approximately about six months to work out. So we are -- Q1 was right in the middle of that and beginning of that at this point. So, I would say, it\u2019s a combination for transition from standard to high-value products but also destocking with some of our large customers. William March : Got it. And on CZ and SmartDose, could you just give us an update on the number of trials that are currently utilizing those two products? Eric Green : Yeah. So I mentioned earlier, we are trying to get with the exact number every time, but I would say that, when we are talking about CZ, there is an increase -- a slight increase. SmartDose is relatively a same as last quarter we talk about, but there is more conversations. In fact, quite a bit more conversations happening right now around DAs and around sampling of discussions about variations of the product to support various drug therapies. So it\u2019s certainly better than what we talked about last quarter. William March : Got it. And just one quick one for Bill, Bill over the past six quarters or so return on invested capital has really been moving up about 400 basis points, 500 basis points. Could you just maybe highlight what's driving that? Bill Federici : Certainly, the high value product growth that we have seen over the last several quarters, in fact, over the last couple years has been very, very strong and that drives the favorable mix shift. We are doing a great job of operational efficiencies. We are doing a great job of getting good leverage out of the other parts of the business. So those things are all helping produce. At the same time, we are -- we continue to invest in the business and that will continue to be a drag on our return on invested capital. But we are doing and improving like making sure we are investing in those things like high value product capacity to be able to continue to grow at the rates that we have been able to grow. So, yeah, I think, the big -- the two biggest drivers our HVP growth and the operational efficiency. William March : Great. Thanks guys. Have a good one. Eric Green : Thank you, Bill. Bill Federici : Thank you, Bill. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations for any closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Takia.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quentin, and good morning, everyone. Following a strong start to the year, our second quarter performance fell short of expectations. While we delivered 4% organic sales growth, with strong performance in Contract Manufacturing and Pharma, unexpected softness in Generics and Biologics caused an unfavorable sales mix, which resulted in a drop in the gross margin for the quarter. While we have taken several actions, including increased customer interactions, to better forecast their demand patterns and have put in place increased cost controls over our processes, we remain confident that the fundamentals of our markets, our products, and our strategy are solid. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged and we believe that our growth profile will improve in Q4 of this year. I will focus my comments on the details of our sales performance in the quarter. First, at a high level, two areas of our business, Contract Manufacturing and the Pharma market unit, which account for approximately 55% of our total sales, performed well and were at or above our expectations. On the other hand, the Generics and Biologics market units, approximately 45% of our total sales and accounting for 70% of total high-value product sales, were softer than expected due to a variety of customer issues, included continued customer inventory management, drug-launch delays, and customer-related regulatory issues. I will go into more detail in a moment. Turning to slide four. We have laid out our organic sales performance over the last 5 quarters and show our updated full year guidance for each market unit and the Contract Manufacturing segment. I want to take some time to go through each of the businesses in detail regarding the second quarter and talk about the outlook for the balance of 2017. As we expected, Pharma grew mid-single digits after strong double-digit growth in Q1. For the first half of the year, we are very pleased Pharma's growth coming in at high-single digits. Thanks to the realignment of our customer -- commercial organization, which is helping our team better focus on value creation, we are finding more of our large pharma customers seeking higher quality containment and delivery systems and are converting to high-value products. In fact, I had the opportunity to meet with the senior leaders of a major customer at our Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania facility a few weeks ago, and they reaffirmed their commitment to move from standard products to high-value products, commencing later this year. They believe that doing so will aid in their initiative to drive towards zero particulates and defects, which ultimately has a positive impact on patient care. This is a trend we are seeing throughout our customer base and we're well positioned to address the market needs. We expect continued growth in both standard and high-value product sales in this market unit, resulting in healthy high-single digit organic sales growth for the full year. Turning our attention to the Generics market unit. We experienced a continued trend of customer inventory management that began in late Q4 of last year. We've talked about this issue on past calls. In 2016, when our capacities were constrained, our lead times became extended, and as a result, our customers built up inventories to make sure they had sufficient safety stock to cover manufacturing requirements. Our global operations team is successfully reducing lead times for key high-value products, and our customers are responding as we would have expected them to do by reducing their safety stock. More importantly, the increased confidence by our customers in our ability to supply on time is opening up discussions for converting even more of the drug portfolio to West high-value product offerings. This includes our new AccelTRA program developed specifically for our Generics customers. We are experiencing a positive response from this program. And with a number of customers currently testing their drugs for stability with the AccelTRA components, we expect to commence commercial production by early 2018. Additionally, as the quarter progressed, we gained visibility to order pattern changes from some customers, who have been impacted by FDA regulatory actions unrelated to our products. These customers, who purchase both standard and high-value products, have experienced impact to their operations. As a result, these actions depressed their growth over the quarter. Our revised guidance assumes a similar trend in Q3 and to a lesser extent in Q4. Our visibility around the corrective actions these customers are taking is limited. While it is difficult at this time to predict when order volume will return to normal levels, we do have new orders with our largest generic customers, who for the last three quarters, have been running down their safety stock. Therefore, we believe that by Q4, we should see more normal order volumes return. In Biologics, we also experienced some customer inventory management issues in the quarter, but to a lesser extent than in Generics. This did, however, push growth in the market unit down to the mid-single digits. The inventory management activities are related to product launch builds in prior quarters, some customer product launch delays and adjustments associated with conversions to high-value products. I want to reiterate, we are the clear market leader in the growing Biologics market. In fact, our products are on 100% of the newly approved biologic drugs in the U.S. so far in 2017. This, combined with our improving visibility to demand with committed orders gives us the confidence to believe our Biologics units will finish out the year strong. As far as our Crystal Zenith and SmartDose platform sales, we had strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Our customers are adopting CZ for applications where traditional glass falls short of meeting their needs. CZ is well characterized and the recent FDA approvals using CZ containers have brought more customers to West to begin stability studies for future products. Also, the commercial success of our SmartDose technology has resulted in new customer interest and opportunities to West. To that point, in Q2, we signed development agreements with 2 large global customers for the use of SmartDose with their drug candidates. Our contract manufacturing business had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit organic sales growth. All the hard work in 2016 is paying off in 2017, and we're proud to be critical partners to our customers that are bringing new drug delivery and diagnostic devices to the market. Our Dublin facility is currently ramping up and we are on track to hit our expectations for the full year. I want to spend a minute on the progress of our newly created global operation and supply chain organization. The team is focused on driving safety, quality, service, and cost. And on all accounts, the team is making good progress. As an example of this progress, I am pleased to share that our customer, Bristol-Myer Squibb recently named West as the 2017 supplier of the year in quality. I also have an update for you on a major investment we're making to ensure our ability to meet customer demand in the years to come. The Waterford, Ireland, investment is tracking under budget and on time. We are currently partnering with customers to validate the critical insulin sheeting production line, and we expect to start commercial production in the first half of 2018. In Phase II of Waterford, we plan to have high-value product finishing capabilities up and running in late 2018. On slide five, we have revised our sales outlook to reflect the Q2 results in our second half outlook. We are reducing our sales guidance. We now expect full year 2017 to be at the lower end of our long term 6% to 8% organic sales growth target. Our 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance takes into account the margin impact from lowered high-value product sales growth related to Generics and Biologics, and is offset by cost controls and favorable tax benefits from stock-based compensation expense. I'll now turn it over to our CFO, Bill Federici, who will take you through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We issued our second quarter results this morning, reporting net income of $38.8 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Our reported results this quarter include a $0.15 per share charge for the deconsolidation of our operations in Venezuela. Excluding this charge, our Q2 2017 adjusted diluted EPS was $0.66 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings of $0.59 in Q2 of 2016. As a reminder, 2017 reported earnings include tax benefits on option exercises due to an accounting change that took effect in 2017. Our Q2 2017 reported earnings includes a $0.13 per diluted share tax benefit related to stock option exercises. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included at slides 12 through 15 in the presentation that accompanies this call. Turning to sales. slide seven shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Our consolidated second quarter sales of $397.6 million increased by 2.5% versus our second quarter 2016 sales. Excluding the $5.6 million adverse currency effect, our Q2 2017 sales increased 3.9%. Proprietary net sales increased 2.2% versus the same quarter in 2016 excluding exchange. Sales price increases were marginal. Higher sales of CZ and SmartDose, as well as gains in tooling and development revenues, contributed the majority of these sales increases. Sales of our high-value products rose just 2.2% versus the prior year second quarter. Current quarter HVP sales as a percentage of total proprietary products sales were unchanged versus a year ago. Both Q2 2016 and the first half of 2016 saw significant growth in HVPs, up 16.6% and 19.6% respectively. The combined Q2 revenues from CZ and SmartDose of approximately $10 million were $6 million more than the combined 2016 Q2 sales, reflecting strong customer demand. Contract manufactured net sales increased by 10.5% versus the prior year quarter, driven by the ramp up of diabetes customer activity in our newly completed Dublin facility as well as our Arizona facilities. As provided on slide eight, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q2 2017 was 31.4% versus the 34.4% margin we achieved in the second quarter of '16. Proprietary second quarter gross margin of 35.4% was 3.1 margin points lower than the 38.5% achieved in the second quarter of '16. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the unfavorable mix of sales, volume decreases, higher raw material costs and normal inflationary increases in labor and overhead costs. We sold a higher percentage of Contract-Manufactured Products, standard components, CZ and SmartDose devices, and tooling and development revenues, all of which carry lower margins than our high-value product components. HVP sales lag as customers, specifically in the Generics market segment, delayed orders as a result of regulatory actions, which impacted their operations, as well as certain Biologics and Generic customers working off high levels of inventory acquired as part of product launches and/or other inventory management initiatives. To dimension the high-value product sales impact on margins, in Q2 2016, high-value product sales increased by 16.6%. This favorable sales mix added 1.4 margin points to our proprietary gross margin. As contrasted to the current quarter's 2.2% growth in HVPs, which yielded an unfavorable mix impact of 1 margin point to proprietary gross profit margin. Contract-Manufactured second quarter gross margin decreased by 0.8 of a margin point to 16.8%. A favorable mix of products sold was more than offset by higher labor and increased overhead costs associated with new capabilities supporting Contract Manufacturing, customer programs, especially in our new Dublin facility. As reflected on slide nine, Q2 2017 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $1.9 million versus the prior year quarter. Merit and headcount increases in compensation costs were offset by lower incentive comp costs. As a percentage of sales, second quarter 2017 SG&A expense was 15.2% versus 16.1% in the second quarter of '16. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our year-to-date operating cash flow is 26.8 million above what we generated in the first six months of '16, due primarily to our higher operating earnings and the impact of the accounting change with tax benefits associated with stock option exercises, net of higher current year pension plan funding. Our capital spending was $67 million for the first 6 months of '17, approximately 7 million less than at this time in 2016. We expect to spend up to 150 million in capital in 2017. Approximately 60% of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiatives, including approximately 20 million for the construction of our new Waterford facility. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we're confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance currently of $226 million was 23 million more than our December 2016 balance, due primarily to the higher operating cash flows. Approximately $69 million of our cash balances are held by U.S. subsidiaries. Debt at June 30 of 229.5 million was $1 million more than at year-end. Our net debt to total invested capital ratio at quarter-end was 0.2%. Working capital of approximately $429 million at June 30 was 28 million higher than at year end. The majority of the increase is due to increases in our July cash balances, accounts receivable and inventory balances, partially offset by higher accounts payable and the reclassification to current liabilities of our headquarter building note that matures in January of 2018. Looking ahead, our committed proprietary product orders were 382 million at June 2017, 7% lower than at June 2016 excluding exchange. As expected, due to operational gains resulting in lower lead times in our plants, customers do not need to place orders as far in advance, which has the effect of lowering committed orders on hand. We revised our full year 2017 guidance as reflected on slide 11, based on our year-to-date 2017 results and our analysis of the orders on hand. We believe our remaining 2017 quarterly results will follow historical seasonality, wherein Q3 results are traditionally lower than the results achieved in the first and second quarters due to customer and our planned summer shutdowns for preventive maintenance. We expect Q3 2017 EPS to be flat to the prior year. However, we expect a strong Q4, with a return to more normal customer order patterns. We now expect full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.66 to $2.73, which includes the $0.34 of tax benefits from stock option exercises. We have based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.14 per euro versus $1.05 per euro rate used in our prior guidance. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Bill. In closing, we remain confident that the fundamentals of our markets, our products and our strategy are solid. We are maintaining our leadership position with customers. We are expanding our customer portfolio with emerging Biotech and small pharmas as the number of new therapies based on injectable drugs continues to grow. The regulatory hurdles for quality and reliability continue to rise, and our global customer base is increasingly looking to West for worldwide availability, scientific expertise, innovative new components and injection devices, and deep technical service, which we continue to deliver. I want to be clear, we see no change in the fundamental growth drivers and no change in long-term sales growth expectations of 6% to 8% per annum with approximately 100 basis points of operating profit margin expansion per year. Leanne, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Sara Silverman : This is Sara on for Tim. I have a question on cost. I was wondering what levers can you guys pull to manage costs during the delays. I think you mentioned earlier on the call you're implementing some cost controls. And then, kind of, as a related question, how should we be thinking about operating margin expansion this year given the headwinds? Eric Green : So when we were looking at our opportunities, what levers we have available to our business on a short term. It's more around typical cost measures around how we are deploying our resources in our plants. It's also looking at ways to reduce our SG&A or maintain our SG&A as a percentage of sales around that 15% to 15.5%, which we're currently at. This is more around the discretionary spend that we have here at West. Fundamentally, we look at our infrastructure and you look at where we have our operations and our plants and the capacity we have available. There is a demand. We expected demand to continue to pick up latter part of this year. We are ready to take that on. So that's -- the lever we're looking at is more around the discretionary. William Federici : And just to answer your question directly on the operating profit margin expansion. We do expect about a 100 basis points increase based on our current forecast versus prior year. Sara Silverman : And then in terms of visibility, what are you guys doing to gain better visibility with your clients? I don't know how much you can share with us but are you able to provide, kind of, any narrative of what changed between now and last quarter and what you're, kind of, doing to address that? Eric Green : Yes, so what we're doing with our global operations team in our commercial organization is that we have a very robust supply chain group that is actually being tied to our customers and started looking at demand patterns. Not just historic but also forward looking. And so these are the initiatives that we have put in place. But it is really around the overall demand planning, not insular but actually working side-by-side with our customers. Just to reiterate, I mentioned earlier that I had a meeting -- several of us had a meeting with the key leaders of a major Pharma company up in Jersey Shore, and that was one of the key deliverables from that discussion is integrating our group with their group to actually build forecast and demand short-term and more long-term. Operator : Your next question is from William March with Janney. Please go ahead. William March : So first question, Bill, just if you could provide a little more color around the second half financials. Just in terms of 3Q is typically a lighter quarter as factories are retooling, so maybe just a little bit on the revenue cadence. And then you also highlighted a 100 basis points of margin expansion. Is that mainly going to be coming in 4Q, at what -- considering the flat EPS? So just a little more color on the model. Bill Federici : So, yes, I think what we've said in the release and what we're confirming here is that Q3 will be flat on the EPS line to prior-year. We will continue to see the effects of the Generics and the Bio being soft. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we will be expecting to see more -- a return to a more normal order pattern from our customers in both of those regards. So less robust in Q3 as we expect normally in sales but higher growth rates in the fourth quarter. William March : And then, Eric, maybe just you highlighted the double-digit growth in CZ and SmartDose and called out a couple of new customer wins. Could you just give us a sense of the growth you're seeing? Is that coming from the products that have recently been approved commercially, or are you seeing stronger growth from clinical trial and stability trial work? Eric Green : Yes, so around CZ and SmartDose what you're seeing, the increase, as we anticipated this year, is really due to commercial launches. And what we're -- in our comment about additional DAs in the areas around SmartDose it's obviously filling the pipeline for future opportunities. But the growth you're seeing today is really around the commercial launches. Operator : Your next question is from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : I was wondering if you can give a little more color, your proprietary orders, down 7%. I realize obviously, this is a function of several positive variables, including reduced lead times and your improved throughput and capacity expansion. But is there any way to sort of -- is this year-over-year decline of 7%, is that also being impacted, I assume, by some slowdown in the -- outside of the inventory management, but some of the slowdowns you guys have cited? Eric Green : Yes, let me -- so no, Larry, that's a very good question and thank you for bringing that up. I think when you take a look at our high-value products in our backlog today, I'm really pleased with the progress of our operations teams have delivered on over the last 12 to 18 months. Just to remind you, if we look at our high-value product portfolio, it's roughly around 17% -- last year it was about 17% of the number of units we produced at West. And when you break it down, one of the early entrants of highlighted products for us historically has been around Westar. And that process is roughly 1/3 of the high-value product portfolio. Just to remind you that about two years ago with customers, we were averaging a little over 30 weeks for lead times. And that's not acceptable. The work that has been in place today, we're less than a third of that to our customers from a lead time perspective. And that work over the last year, year and a half, is a direct correlation or a direct impact on the increased confidence from our customers and reducing the large bolus orders that were coming in, historically, due to the lead times. I also just -- just to build off of that, to give you a line of sight and confidence. While the Westar is down, was down double digits in the last quarter, the other parts of the high-value product portfolio that we're pushing into new commercial drugs and opportunities, is growing very strongly. Such as, you talked about the self-injection CZ already with your initial question. But the NovaPure and the Envision line, all very much strong double-digit. Yes, from a smaller base, but this supports the strategy of continuously expanding the pipeline of new products, higher quality, to meet the needs of our customers. So it really is that the backlog right now is a direct correlation to the reduction in lead times, specifically around the Westar processing in the Generics space. Lawrence Solow : And then just -- if we can just shift back a little bit on the -- you discussed obviously the slowdown in the quarter on both Biologics and Generics. And just to focus on the Biologics side, is the inventory management -- it sounds like that sort of also ties into some of the delayed ramps that these customers are -- is that change in their plans on their own side? Or is that more of a regulatory -- delayed approvals and whatnot that's causing some of this? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, mostly in the Biologics space is -- a lot of that's driven from our customers in new commercial launches. There is a -- There was some due to a similar situation with Generics but that's at a much lesser extent. It's really around delayed drug products into the marketplace that we have visibility of, and I won't go into details of any one particular customer. But we believe, based on the conversations that latter part of this year, we'll see those becoming real in far as commercial revenue for West to our customers. Lawrence Solow : So that sounds like it's more customer decisions timing related. It's not as if there's been -- that they were too aggressive on their approval forecast or as a whole forecasts were too aggressive or anything. Eric Green : No, Larry, as you know -- a lot of -- many of our customers when they're about to launch new molecules, they buy in -- buy ahead and to prepare for the launch. And if there's a delay in the launch, it does create a little bit of an issue on the flow of new orders. I just want to reiterate, when you look at Biologics, we have no visibility of any lost sales. And the questions that I look at every day is, when you look at new molecules coming through the pipeline, are we participating on those molecules? And we can confidently say yes, specifically in the Biologics space, it's very positive. Now I'll just give you an example, there's a major customer with a major biosimilar that's just been recommended for approval in the bio presentation, and what I'm excited about is that our NovaPure line is on that. So again, it's another win for West but frankly speaking, it's a win for our customers and for the ultimate patient. Lawrence Solow : And then just on the Generics side, that sounds like that's a little bit more, at least recently, a little bit more regulatory issues that sort of crimped production. And you guys, fairly enough, sounds like you don't have great visibilty on that at least for the next couple of quarters. So you go down in Q3 and, I guess you have some visibility on the timing of other orders so that that'll improve, that'll offset some of the weakness. Any way to sort of gauge maybe very high level, what some of these regulatory issues are or would that potentially crimp -- has there been a change in standards or anything or is it or anything like that? Or is it more just coincidental timing that where a bunch of the regulatory issues sort of bunched together, to cause a more significant slowdown that was noticeable for you guys? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, it's a good question. Let me try to dimension this for you. When we're looking at the business of Generics today, in the asked question, there's been a decline. So we said mid-single-digit decline in Q3. Last quarter, we were sitting here saying that we felt more comfortable of the large Generic players, which is was about 4 of them, frankly, make up 40% of the Generics business. We have visibility line of sight, orders on hand and how that's going to play out for the rest of the year. What we didn't anticipate, frankly, is about half of the decline of that mid-single-digit decline in Generics came from mostly in India. What we've seen there is that it's not just one or two, there's several of our customers that have gone through audits and they have 40 trees that were supplied. And that has delays right now on material going into those customers to produce. Now, we're very sensitive to the fact that if they're not able to correct their -- they have corrective actions that actually get approved, we know that these drugs will have to be picked up from somewhere else. And we're staying tuned to that. Our best estimate based on talking to the customers and also looking at some available data in the marketplace such as IMS, suggests between three to six plus months before a transition would occur. Now that's what we're focused on right now. So about half of the decline in Generics came from specifically, not a 100% but mostly out of our customers in India. Lawrence Solow : And that's where the regulatory issues have obviously appeared then? Eric Green : Correct. Lawrence Solow : And then just last question, just on the euro. The, I guess, the -- using an average of $1.14 versus a prior $1.05. I guess that's $0.09. Is that about just the historical $0.01 to $0.01 rate still apply? Bill Federici : Yes, Larry, it's a little bit less than that because you got some other currencies running against you in Asia and Europe -- Asia and South America. The way we're looking at is that is about $0.03 in the back half of the year will be the benefit. If it stays at $1.14 for the for the rest of the year. Lawrence Solow : Instead of the 4.5 you get a little offset on the Asian currencies so it's about $0.03. So that's great. I appreciate that.. Operator : Your next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Jared Meggison : This is Jared Meggison on for Dave, this morning. I have one quick question. Regarding high-value products, so we've had a little bit slower growth in 1Q and 2Q, now. And I'm just wondering, how are you guys doing the switch up the value chain for high-value products? Is there still demand from customers to move from Westar and FluroTec all the way up to NovaPure? Or given kind of the slower environment here, is there may be a slowdown in that shift up the chain? Eric Green : Yes, that's a very good question, thank you. When you look at the high-value product portfolio and you look at the whole spectrum that we've laid out on the bottom left hand side of that portfolio, it's really the Westar, an entry point of high-value products. And that's where we've seen the decline, specifically around the customers that I mentioned around the Generic space. When you look around the NovaPure and Envision, they're all -- again, it's a small base. If you look at Westar, it is larger than the accumulation of self-injection CZ administration systems for NovaPure and Envision. But those product portfolios are growing well in the double digits, significantly. So we're seeing a continued migration towards the highest Quality by Design of NovaPure. We're also seeing an increase in Envision's inspection requirements, specifically in the Biologics and now coming into the Generics space. So we're comfortable that we're continuously moving up the value chain when you look at the quality of these new products. I just want to reiterate though the high-value products right now -- or last year, was about 17% of the number of units we produced. And we believe that will continuously increase 100 basis points to 150 basis points every year. Operator : Your next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : I'm pleasantly surprised to hear that you're still talking about a 100 basis points of margin expansion this year, that's certainly better than we had on our first pass at the model. Could you just sort of talk about how much of that is sort of like currency rate versus operational, just like that, could you just sort of walk it, what's on the underlying op margin for guide? Bill Federici : Yes, so currency is not going to affect the margin percentage very much. It does affect -- its $0.03 on the EPS but the margin is generally not terribly affected by it. We do have, as Eric mentioned, we have operational work that we are working on with our group in the operations. That should bring down the operating cost a little bit. And we're looking at continued cost controls around SG&A that will help. And then we believe that there's the ramp up in HVPs in the back half of the year that as we -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the HVP growth has a very large impact on that mix shift, has a very large impact on our margins. So we believe that that's the big story there. So returning to, hopefully, normal order patterns in Q4. Good cost controls as well as operational efficiencies,, and we believe we would get to approximately 100% -- 100 basis points. Derik De Bruin : So this sort of then begs the question -- I'm getting this from a couple of people this morning, it's like, I mean, you've seen -- this isn't the first time we've sort of seen these sort of -- this isn't the first time we've seen some of the slippage in terms of the HVPs and things like that. I think you go back 2011-14, there was another historical event like this. Can you sort of talk about, comparing to what you've seen in the past and how long it took you to reset and the -- how this sort of compares to some of the other delays and some of the other things you've seen in the past? Bill Federici : And yes, absolutely, we have seen this before in the first quarter of '14 and also in 2011 and quite frankly, before that in 2008 and '09 as well. It is -- yes, the underlying fundamentals of the business are that if the products don't go away, if they're not pulled from the marketplace, or if there is no leakage to other -- of market share, that we will continue to see those units when it's comes back. And a lot of what we're seeing today is driven by both the -- our operational excellence, where we've reduced lead times and also customer inventory management issues. So some of this is expected to happen. It does happen periodically, and we do believe that we will continue to grow. The marketplace's -- the marketplace demand for our higher value products driven by the need for a higher quality product, more purity and more -- cleaner product, what our customers call zero-defect mentality, is going to continue to drive the need for high-value products. And as we continue to believe, we've got very high market share in the Biologic space. We're not losing any business in -- been no fundamental change. So we believe that these order patterns will return more to normal. And then lastly, I think there's also, you've got to remember, we grew very, very high percentages of high-value products I mentioned both in the first half, in the first quarter -- the first two quarters of 2016 in high-value products. The growth rates were high-teens. So those are above the norm of where we would say high-value products should go, which is high singles to low doubles. So there is a return to, a reversion to more of the mean. And that's what we're seeing today. No lost business. No change in the fundamentals. We believe that the products are still there. The demand is there. It's just got to -- it'll come back in future quarters. Derik De Bruin : And that was, sort of, the question on basically nothing to shake your long term outlook? Bill Federici : Absolutely nothing. Eric Green : No, Dave no change. Derik De Bruin : So I guess on the Generic issue and sort of like the 43 and the quality issues there. It's like you solved some -- you had some issues with the Generics customers in Q4 and in Q1. Were these sort of like -- the ones that sort of manifested this quarter, were these the same ones or were these new ones? Just like I'm sort of thinking about your visibility in terms of what is it. Is it like stuff that lingered or it's sort of like whack-a-mole where new ones are popping up? Eric Green : Yes, from our perspective, working with our customers, there's newer issues that are being faced with our customers, specifically in India. While there are some issues that are outside India. They've been going on for some time now. This is specifically, more than a handful, I would say, in India. Derik De Bruin : And just the -- you talked about FX being a tailwind for that. What's the overall topline tailwind? What's the overall topline for the full year for the FX contribution? Bill Federici : Well, I'll just tell you, in the back half of the year, it'll be approximately $20 million. Derik De Bruin : Can we talk a little bit about the tax rate as well? Bill Federici : Sure. Derik De Bruin : Just a sense as you get the stock option changes, I realize that makes things a little bit lumpy. But how do we -- any guidance in terms of how to think about it, given it's been in single digits the last two quarters? Bill Federici : Yes, and that's driven by this -- by the tax benefit from those option exercises. If you pull that out, the business is still strong in -- from a geographic mix perspective in the U.S. and in places like Germany, which have high tax rates. So if you strip that out, our tax rate, if you're thinking about tax rate without it, should be about 30.5%. Derik De Bruin : But, yes, yes, but yes okay. It sort of makes the next couple of quarters -- it just makes quarters much more complicated to model. Bill Federici : It does, and we apologize for the accounting change but there's not much we can do about it. Derik De Bruin : No, you are not the only ones who are doing this. It's just it's always a surprise now whenever we read it, the earnings releases. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for any further remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Leanne. Thank you for joining us on today's conference call.

I now turn the call over to West\u2019s CEO and President Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quinitn, and good morning to everyone. Our team had a solid performance during the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations and consistent to prior quarter performance. Importantly, we saw an improved to positive growth in our Generics market unit and continued strength in our Contract Manufacturing business. We believe we are on track to finish 2017 with strong organic growth led by high-value products sales in the Biologics and Generics market units. I want to start this quarterly review by addressing the impact from the hurricanes during Q3. Our highest priority is always the safety of our employees, and I\u2019m pleased to report that all our employees and their families made it through the storms unharmed. Our team did an excellent job of pre-storm preparations and post-storm cleanups and restarts.  Puerto Rico continues to be a challenge. Damage to the regional infrastructure is extensive, and is affecting our employees and customers on the island. Our facility saw minimal damage and we are now partially operational due to the use of backup on-site generators. I\u2019m proud of our employees on how they rose to meet the challenges of these storms, and we at West are committed to helping them with ongoing relief efforts. In the third quarter, we estimate that the weather shutdowns caused a negative sales impact of $2 million, over half to Biologic customers located on the island and the balance to Contract Manufacturing customers. In the fourth quarter, we could see another $5 million of sales impact, mostly due to delays in shipments to biologic customers in Puerto Rico. This risk is reflected in our revised 2017 guidance. Bill Federici will go over the Q3 financial details in a few minutes. So let\u2019s move to Slide 4 for a discussion on the trends we saw in our specific market units and businesses. We generated 4% organic sales growth in the quarter and remain on track to generate approximately 6% for the full year 2017. Contract Manufacturing had another double-digit organic sales growth quarter. Our enhanced focus on serving customers in the drug delivery and diagnostics market is yielding strong performance, and we are encouraged with the expanding pipeline of new projects that is offsetting slower growth from our consumer products customers. We expect some moderation as we anniversary a strong Q4 from last year, and we expect to generate high single-digit growth for the full year. In our Pharma market unit, we had a slowdown from a few large customers after a strong first half of the year. We remain on track for a full-year organic sales performance, mid-single-digits. In Biologics, we had a low single-digit sales growth. If we add back delayed sales from the hurricane, growth would have been mid-single-digits and in line with our expectations. We remain on track for double-digit growth in Q4 and high single-digits for the full year. And finally, I\u2019m pleased to report that Generics returned to organic sales growth in the third quarter. We are seeing more typical demand trends from our larger customers as our inventory management has stabilized. The Generics unit is on track to deliver double-digit sales growth in Q4, and we expect the full year to be flat compared to the prior-year. Turning to Slide 5. We often talk about our high-value component strategy that encourages our customers to move up the quality chain from standard packaging components to higher value offerings. Such as Westar RS, RU, Envision and NovaPure. This mix shift has been fueling our organic sales growth and we expect it to continue to drive growth in margin expansion for the foreseeable future. On this slide, we highlight new products that have been featured in recent press releases and will be featured at upcoming trade shows. Our industry is known for long customer adoption curves, and that is why we constantly strive to build a diverse portfolio of innovative products that will fuel our future growth. In Q3, we had another strong quarter for recently launched Envision and NovaPure components. These offerings address the highest quality requirements in the industry, and we are expanding our high-value product portfolio with the new elastomer portfolio offering called AccelTRA. AccelTRA packaging component helps Generics manufacturers meet increasing quality standards, ensure fast response to market volatility and move their product to market quickly. We are pleased with the initial reception to AccelTRA, more than 30 customers have requested samples and a number of these have started formal stability trials. This slide also mentions the Westar ID Adapter. We have a growing portfolio of administration devices used in hospital, healthcare and home settings. The ID Adapter is used by healthcare providers to enable successful intradermal injections. We recently highlighted a WHO study that used the ID Adapter in a trial for dose sparing polio vaccinations. Our Wearables portfolio is also expanding. At the November PDA conference in Vienna, we will feature extensions of our SmartDose drug delivery platform with enhanced usability and performance capabilities, such as Bluetooth connectivity to drive patient adherence. The expanded portfolio will now include dosing options as large as 10 ml. As you can see from the small example of the new products, we focus our R&D investments to broaden our product portfolio that includes high-value product components, wearable injectors and administration systems our customers seek. On Slide 6, we have updated full year 2017 guidance. We continue to expect approximately 6% organic sales growth for the full year. And we are raising the sales guidance range based on our Q3 performance, and a slight tailwind in FX offset by hurricane-related impacts in Puerto Rico. We are also raising our adjusted EPS range from $2.74 to $2.79. Turning to Slide 7. 2017 has been a transition year as we continue to work through our customers\u2019 inventory management activities that started in 2016. We expect the return of a more typical growth pattern in Q4 of this year. Looking forward to 2018, we expect organic sales growth in the range of 6% to 8%, as a result of market volume growth and continued high-value product conversions. Our long-term outlook remains consistent with 6% to 8% annual constant currency organic sales growth. As we have stated in the past, we expect on average, about 1 point to come from price, 2 to 3 points from market volume and 3 to 4 points from market shift. A significant portion of our component volume sales is still in standard format, and with the increasing quality focus of our customers, we feel that we have significant opportunity for converting standard products to high-value products. Anticipating increased volumes over the next few years, we are also expanding our manufacturing capacity, including the completion of our Waterford site, which should commence commercial production in mid-2018. And as you saw in the prior slide, we have a portfolio of proprietary devices that will accelerate our growth as they gain traction in the marketplace. We expect gross margins to expand as product mix continues its trend towards high-value products. This, combined with the numerous initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiencies that our global operation team has put in place, will further improve our costs structure. We expect to benefit from operating profit margin expansion, on average, 100 basis points per year for the next several years as a result of these activities. CapEx is expected to be in the range of between $150 million to $175 million. A preferred capital allocation is to invest in our high-value growth products. We believe these investments will fuel the development and launch of the next generation of integrated containment and delivery solutions we know our customers are counting on us to deliver. I\u2019ll now turn it over to our CFO, Bill Federici, who will take you through our detailed financial results for the quarter. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We issued our third quarter results this morning reporting net income of $51 million or $0.67 per diluted share. As a reminder, 2017 earnings per share include tax benefits on stock compensation due to an accounting change effective at the beginning of 2017. Our third quarter 2017 results include a $0.06 per share tax benefit due to this change. Our Q3 results also include a $0.09 per share reimbursement of prior costs incurred in the development of a safety technology we licensed to a third-party. That amount is included as other operating income, in our Q3 results. Our adjusted diluted earnings in the third quarter of 2016, were $0.53 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included on Slides 14 through 17 in the presentation that accompanies this call. Turning to sales. Slide 9 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Our consolidated third quarter sales of 398.2 million increased by 5.7% versus our third quarter 2016 sales. Excluding the 7.7 million favorable foreign exchange effect, our Q3 2017 sales increased 3.7%. Proprietary net sales increased 1.5% versus the same quarter 2016, excluding exchange. Envision and its respective components and SmartDose devices saw the highest sales increases. Sales of our high value product offerings rose 1.1% versus the prior-year third quarter. Current quarter high value products sales as a percentage of total proprietary products sales were flat versus a year ago. Both Q3 2016 and the first nine months of 2016, saw significant growth in high-value products, up 24% and 21% respectively versus their prior year comparators due to strong customer demand, especially in our Generics and Biologics market segments, as customers ramped up the product launches and were reacting to our lengthened order lead times in our facility. Our combined Q3 revenues from CZ and SmartDose of approximately $9.5 million were $1.7 million or 22% more than the combined Q2 -- 2016 Q3 sales. Contract-Manufactured net sales increased by 11.5% versus the prior-year quarter, ex-currency, driven by the ramp up of customer activity in our newly completed Dublin contract facility. As provided on Slide 10, our consolidated Q3 2017 gross profit margin of 31.4% was seven tenth of a margin point lower than the margin we achieved in the third quarter of 2016. Proprietary third quarter margin of 35.8% was six tenth of a margin lower than the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin is due to higher production overhead and depreciation, partially due to preproduction activities at our new Waterford site, with a negative product mix and modest price increases. HVP sales growth slowed as certain Biologics and Generic customers continue to work off high levels of inventory acquired as part of product launches and in response to our previous long order lead times. Contract-Manufactured third quarter gross margin increased by three tenth of a margin point to 16.3%, due to the favorable mix of products sold and volume increases, which were partially offset by higher labor and increased overhead cost, associated with new capabilities supporting Contract Manufacturing customer programs, especially in our expanded Dublin facility. As reflected on Slide 11, Q3 2017 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $3.2 million versus the prior-year quarter. Higher compensation costs and outside services expenses were partially offset by lower pension expense. As a percentage of sales, third quarter 2017 SG&A expense was 15.4% versus 15.5% in the third quarter of \u201816. Third quarter 2017 other income was $9.5 million, the majority of this is due to the $9.1 million reimbursement of prior costs incurred in the development of a safety technology we licensed to a third-party. Slide 12 shows our key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our year-to-date operating cash flow of $181.8 million is $34.2 million above what we generated in the first nine months of 2016, due to higher net income, lower income tax payments and the inclusion of the tax benefit on share-based payments offset by higher pension contributions. Our capital spending was $101.3 million for the first nine months of 2017, approximately $21 million less than at this time in 2016. We expect to spend up to $150 million in capital in 2017. Approximately 60% of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion activities, including approximately $25 million for the construction of the new Waterford facility. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we\u2019re confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at September 30, of $269 million was $66 million more than our December 2016 balance. The increase reflects the operating cash flow generated so far this year, net of our capital expenditures and $26.9 million in share repurchases. Our cash balance also increased due to the positive currency effect. Debt at September 30, 2017, of $229.8 million was $1.2 million more than at yearend. Our cash balance exceeds our debt balances, as such we are delevered on a net debt to total invested capital basis. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we paid off the $33.1 million remaining mortgage balance on our headquarters building that was scheduled to mature in January of 2018, which will generate a small Q4 benefit from a lower interest expense. Working capital of approximately $477 million at September 30th was $76 million higher than at year-end. The majority of the increase is due to increases in our cash balances, accounts receivables and inventory balances, partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as the reclassification to current of our headquarter building mortgage. The accounts receivable increase was due to higher sales and currency effects on our international receivables as well as extended payment terms by certain customers. Looking ahead, our committed proprietary product orders were $375 million at September 2017, 6% lower than at September 2016, excluding exchange. As expected, due to the operational gains resulting in lower lead times in our plants, customers do not need to place orders as far in advance, which has had the effect of lowering committed orders on hand. Based on our year-to-date 2017 results and our analysis of the orders on hand, we have revised our full year 2017 guidance in this morning\u2019s release. That guidance is summarized on Slide 13. We anticipate Q4 sales in our proprietary business to return to more normal growth rates. Additionally, we expect a return to mid-single-digit growth in our Contract Manufacturing business. Our Q4 results may be adversely affected by up to $5 million of sales and $0.03 of EPS by the recent hurricanes that have affected our facility and our customers\u2019 facilities in Puerto Rico. Our Contract Manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico has restarted partial production. We now expect full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.79. We have based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.18 per euro for the remainder of 2017 versus the $1.14 per euro rate used in our prior guidance. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Bill. In conclusion, we\u2019re seeing good progress with our market-led strategy. With quality, scientific and technical expertise, that is unmatched in our industry, we are developing deep insights into what our customers\u2019 need and are developing unique solutions for them. We have a strong pipeline of innovative, high-value products and delivery devices that will address future market needs, and our operations team is working to apply manufacturing excellence and best practice across a global network to deliver better service to our customers and reduce costs. With strong market fundamentals driving our business, our team is focused on delivering the year-end for our customers and laying the groundwork for future success in 2018 and beyond. Jonathan, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies . Jared Meggison : This is Jared Meggison on for Dave Windley. I just want to dive a little deeper into the backlog being down 6%. I know you talked about longer lead times, but I just wanted to touch on the efficiencies you guys are getting in your proprietary products. I know you previously discussed some increased efficiencies in your manufacturing processes. So I guess what I\u2019m curious about is, are you guys continuing to get efficiencies or was that more of a one-time gain and now you\u2019re just operating more efficiently and seeing lower orders? Or -- can you just expand on that? Eric Green : Jared, a very good question. And what we have seen over the last 1.5 to 2 years a reduction -- significant reduction from lead times that were somewhat inflated, end of \u201815 going into 2016, due to a surge of demand really in the Biologic -- I\u2019m sorry, in the Generics space, for our high-value products. Because of the improvements we made in Jersey Shore facility, in Pennsylvania, also the investments we made with Kinston, North Carolina, we\u2019re able to add capacity, which as I mentioned, reduced these cycle times significantly. I would argue at this point, we\u2019re not satisfied where we are. If we\u2019ve mentioned -- we talked a little bit about AccelTRA, that\u2019s a program that\u2019s designed to take lead times that could be anywhere between 10 to 15 weeks down to less than half that. So we\u2019re continuously -- with the continuous improvement mindset -- driving more efficiencies. And you\u2019re right, the net result is our customers are less dependent on putting orders out three -- two or three quarters in advance to more in just-in-time mentality. So we\u2019re making good progress but we have more work to do, and we\u2019re seeing the benefit with more of the response from our customers. Jared Meggison : Great. And then regarding the hurricane impact in 4Q, I know you quantified the revenue as potentially $5 million. Can you maybe quantify what that does to margin? Is that kind of a flow-through there or what are the expectations around that? Bill Federici : Yes, the margin impact, Jared, will be an adverse impact about $0.03 on the EPS line. So about $3 million of operating profit. Jared Meggison : And then last... Eric Green : [indiscernible] Jared Meggison : And then last one from me. I think you guys have mentioned Generics was expected to grow double digits in 4Q. If you could just expand on that expectation? Is that a normalization of the regulatory issues we had seen in 2Q, 3Q? Or have you guys had some larger orders come in? Eric Green : Yes, it\u2019s really the work our customers, the generic customers have done on their inventory management. Again, over a year ago, they built up inventories due to the long lead times. They got really comfortable toward the tail end of 2016 -- where we were -- and with the continuous improvement. And that has really anniversaried out during the Q3 of this year. As you know, we are a make-to-order environment, so we have visibility of orders on hand that we\u2019re currently working on delivering with expectations in Q4 with Generics. So it really is around the inventory management activities that were done by our customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your question please. Larry Solow : Just a couple of follow-ups. Just on the lead time question. Does -- as you guys, obviously, this is your own successes demonstrated here. Did the lead times eventually -- does there come to an inflection point when this begins to go the other way? Or is it that tight now for the customer or that much better for the customer that -- this will always be some very little lead time? And do you guys see benefit from that? Obviously, the customer could hold less inventory, you hold less raw materials on hand. Does that -- is that actually driving better profit for you? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, it\u2019s a benefit for both our customers and for ourselves. And, frankly, I think we\u2019ve more normalized in the last couple of quarters or three quarters, I would argue, with our operations on lead times. And as we look -- as the global operations team is looking at putting in place continuous improvements with more automation, more process flow designs. It gives us the ability to continuously drive that lead time down further to continue to be the best-in-class in the industry, frankly. But you\u2019re right, while we\u2019re able to create more efficiencies, we drive costs of our customers working capital, higher-quality and delivery, faster to our customers, which will translate into better margins for West. Larry Solow : And just so -- as this the improved throughput and increased capacity, I suppose it\u2019s a freed up, given additional capacity that allows you to grow or even look for other opportunities that maybe you couldn\u2019t do not too long ago? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, so that\u2019s a very good point. And we had some constraints on moving customers from standard packaging components to high-value products about one and a half years ago, just due to constraints of our operations. With the lower lead times, the conversations with customers to move more of their portfolio towards high-value products is a lot easier. And that\u2019s that -- and as you know, what comes with that, right? It\u2019s higher revenues and higher margins per transaction. So that is -- that\u2019s going to be a benefit as we go forward, and we know the global operations team is really focused on maintaining and in improving on those metrics, so that our commercial organization has that confidence with the conversations at our customers. Larry Solow : Great. And just a couple of questions on the specific end markets. On the Biologics side, obviously, it\u2019s been held back by the aforementioned inventory issues. It sounds like you guys are pretty confident with the high single-digit growth for the year, you\u2019ll obviously get into the double digits in Q4. As you look out, more importantly, into 2018, does that double-digit growth rate sort of incorporate into that sort of 6% to 8% overall growth next year? Bill Federici : Yes, on the Biologics... Eric Green : Yes. You\u2019re right on the Biologics, we\u2019re starting to see that more normalized in Q4 actually outsized, I would say, with double-digits. It\u2019s very strong double-digits. And as you look into 2018, what we\u2019re seeing with our customers and conversations with our customers, we\u2019ll be back to more normal levels. That could oscillate between quarter-to-quarter between high-single to low double, but it\u2019s in that corridor. Larry Solow : Got it. And then just lastly on the Generic area, I know you guys had lot of timing and whatnot impacted you guys, but also there has been some slowdown in the production industry-wide a lot more, seems like a little tighter regulations or at least more warning letters, FDA audits and whatnot. Has that -- any change in that front, any reaction from customers? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, well there\u2019s been not a lot of change on that regard specifically around India. We are continuously working with our customers as they work through these issues. I would say though, we had a pretty strong performance not just in India but throughout Asia in Q3. So we think it\u2019s coming back to the more normal type of performance. I just want to remind you that our business in India where it\u2019s mostly impacted by these regulatory hurdles, is a very small piece of our Generics business, in fact, it\u2019s less than 5% of our entire Generics business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of William March from Janney Montgomery. Your question please. William March : First question, maybe just talk about the adoption curve you\u2019re seeing for NovaPure and Westar Envision? And maybe how does that compare to some of the legacy HVP products like Westar and RS and RU and kind of just a long-term dynamic of that shift and then the shift of standard to high value products? Eric Green : Yes. No. So, Bill, when you look at the NovaPure and Envision, and if you can just kind of think about the product portfolio moving up the high-value quality curve, these are the services and product solutions that we offer our customers that are more recently launched, and what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of interest, because Envision obviously gets into the subvisible detection of defects. And we get into NovaPure, that\u2019s really quality by design. Both of them though are very small as an overall percentage of our high-value product portfolio, but the migration from either standard to that part of the portfolio or even from, typically, Westar RU, RS, FluroTec all the way up to NovaPure has continued to be very attractive for our customers. Give you an example : NovaPure manufacturing capability we came online about almost a year ago in Kinston, North Carolina, it\u2019s been validated. We have worked with our customers on stability so we can move their highest level of Biologics on NovaPure. And the economics are quite attractive, obviously, for our customers who saves -- reduces their defects and improves their quality. And for us, it\u2019s actually moving -- helps us with our gross margins, obviously. So we\u2019re excited about it, but it is a small number, and I got to be careful when we talk about very strong growth, but it\u2019s a long migration. But it\u2019s exciting to see the traction we\u2019re getting from our customers. William March : Got it. And then on the Pharma segment, I know in the last call you called out a major customer that\u2019s going to be migrating from standard to high-value products beginning in 2018. Are you seeing -- are you having conversations with additional Pharma customers about that? And then maybe is that going to be a little bit of a headwind here in 3Q and 4Q as that customer works down standard inventory as they begin the migration? Eric Green : No, I think what you\u2019re going to see is -- so the answer to your question, the first part is, yes, we\u2019re continuing to have conversations. That one particular customer -- that migration is commencing in 2018. We\u2019re quite excited about it because it supports one of their major initiatives of driving for zero defect at their -- within their organization, but also enables us to put our highest quality product on their products.  Secondly though, we\u2019ll see a little bit of a transition you could argue, it might be a little bit of a headwind but we\u2019re managing through that with our customer, as they migrate and we don\u2019t see too much volatility. What you\u2019ll see this quarter, in Q3, the volatility that we saw, it really is a follow-on of a very, very strong first half and the sales of the first half were led by packaging components for insulin delivery. Just to remind you that we have a pretty strong position in the diabetes market. And so -- and then also we\u2019re seeing growth in the Envision administration system products also. So we don\u2019t think Q3 is a typical concern because this is the typical normal quarterly fluctuation, and we continue to believe in mid-single-digit in Pharma\u2019s to be expected. William March : Got it. And then just one quick one for Bill. Could you maybe just talk about capital deployment. And now with the net cash balance where you guys stand on your thoughts around share repurchases and maybe accelerating that? Bill Federici : Sure, thanks, Bill. So absolutely, as Eric mentioned in his prepared remarks, our first order of business is to invest back into the core of our business; the high-value product programs. That will continue to be our initial first pass on capital allocation. We do have a board-authorized share buyback program that runs through the end of the year. And we are -- as we mentioned, we\u2019ve -- taken down a part of that and there is still a piece to go that\u2019s available to us under that program. And we have affected about $26.9 million through the first nine months of the year.  In terms of how we\u2019re looking at the balance sheet, we\u2019re very comfortable with our balance sheet the way it is. We believe that it continues to provide us with the necessary liquidity to be able to continue to grow our high-value product programs and our proprietary delivery systems as well. So no fundamental change in that in the near term. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Robert Amparo : This is actually Robert on for Tim. So we\u2019ve seen this one situation where biosimilars are taking more than expected share from innovators. Do you guys see this dynamic as disruptive to West in the short-term possibly some of these customers might adjust their inventory? Eric Green : That is -- biosimilars are very new in the states at this point, and it\u2019s obviously long-term, it\u2019s a very attractive space, when you start looking at large molecules. And we don\u2019t see -- we believe our position in that part of the market is actually very attractive. To give you an example, in Q3, there were, we believe there\u2019s 14 NMEs that were approved and of which seven were Biologics, about 4 were biosimilars and 3 were small molecules. We were in all those presentations. So it shows that we\u2019re not just in the Biologics or small molecules. We have a very good position in the biosimilar space. Robert Amparo : Okay. Great. And really quick Contract Manufacturing was pretty strong in the quarter. And I know you mentioned you saw minimal damage and you\u2019re back up and partially operational, but is there anything else you can comment on regarding strength? Eric Green : Yes, so the team has done a really good job of Contract Manufacturing. This is a business that has -- and I\u2019m pleased with the leadership team in that part of the organization where they have really focused intently in the diagnostics and med device space. And as you know, if you were to sit here talking about it 3 years ago, I think there was pretty robust part of the portfolio was in consumer products. While that\u2019s a very important area, our focus has really been towards the healthcare space, and today less than 20% of our sales of that business is in the consumer products. The growth really is coming from product launches of our customers with new molecules and new delivery devices going into the market, and we are -- we, for example, in Dublin, we built a facility dedicated for a line for delivery device and that delivery device is -- we\u2019re having troubles keeping up with the volume, frankly. And so that\u2019s a great example on how we\u2019re -- the focus has given us more opportunities and the pipeline looks very rich. So it is going to be tough comp in Q4, but that team is well positioned to continue to grow that business very well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Couple of questions. Bill, I\u2019m just curious, the reimbursement -- the $9.1 million or the $9.5 million reimbursement for cost, you originally guided to $0.53 flattish EPS number for the quarter and the conversation whether this was going to come in 4Q, and it was going to be the smaller amount, I think is around $8 million. I guess what changed in terms of timing given that the -- given the call was on July 27? Bill Federici : Nothing changed in terms of timing. I mean, these are deals that happen when they happen. So we are -- we were -- I think we\u2019re very clear on what we expected. The number was a little different than what we had originally said, but the $9.1 million is running through other operating income, and we did say that it was going to be in Q3, not Q4, Derik, just to correct you there. And the $8 million versus $9.1 million, the 8 million was Euros. And so that $9.1 million. Derik De Bruin : Got you, okay. And I guess I\u2019m just curious the stock-based accounting changes are, it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s like a $0.40 tailwind you had this year. Was it -- I mean, how do you look at that in terms of next year in terms of comps? And what sort of headwind does that create from a timeline standpoint? Bill Federici : It\u2019s a great question. This is -- it is an area where this new accounting, used to run through the equity section. Now they\u2019re -- the accountants have decided that you go through the income statement. We had very, very high levels of activity. As you know, the excess tax benefit is based on a lot of different variables, first one being the existing stock [indiscernible] strike price of those options, time they were given. So there\u2019s a number of variables that are involved, it\u2019s very, very hard to predict when individuals either be it retired individuals or individuals that are still at the company are going to exercise their options. So we\u2019ve been transparent in terms of what the actual results have been. I can tell you, if you look back in history, the amount is -- in prior years, even though it\u2019s run through the equity section, has not nearly been as high as what we\u2019ve seen this year. It\u2019s run -- it was about $19 million in 2016 and about -- and smaller amounts before that. So while there are still options out there that are available to the exercised. Describing for you and how we could possibly predict that going into the future, is very difficult because of those various variables, including what happens with tax reform going forward. Those are things that make it extraordinarily difficult. We think the best thing to do is to be transparent, but if you\u2019re -- in terms of helping you understand what should be the particular period -- but if you\u2019re trying to think about, I wouldn\u2019t use the $0.30 that we\u2019ve seen, the $30 million that we\u2019ve seen thus far the $0.40, I would think more in lines of what we\u2019ve seen in the past, which has been kind of in that $10 million to $18 million range. So we will continue to update you as we go along, but predicting something like that is very, very difficult. Derik Bruin : And then just one final question, I guess when you sort of look at the I think 6% to 8% long-term number and the 100 basis points with margin expansion sort of built-in, I mean that\u2019s sort of what we were running through our models. But I guess, if you look at the -- it sort of puts the op margin number by 2020 versus your prior guidance sort of at the lower end of that range of that. I guess what\u2019s the delta -- I guess what\u2019s still the biggest delta in terms of potentially getting from what now looks like the $19 million -- sort of like the $19 million to $23 million which you said previously. There still must be FX and proprietary and then the new product sets that are coming is the big delta is in that margin number? Bill Federici : Yes, look, I think Derik what we\u2019re saying is that construct the six. -- the 6% to 8% growth organically driven by the mix shift to high-value products and the increased optionality in terms of growth coming from our proprietary devices is going to drive along with operational efficiencies, is going to drive approximately 100 basis points on average each year to our operating margin. We still feel very, very comfortable with making those claims. And we\u2019ve actually seen this result when high-value product growth is high, in that high-singles to low-doubles that we expected to grow over the long periods of time. That generates very, very good margin. There\u2019s a great correlation between that and generating good margin expansion. So that construct along with our operational efficiencies gives us a lot of comfort that we\u2019re going to continue to grow in approximately 100 basis points on average per year. Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Quintin Lai for any further remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Jonathan. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s conference call. An online archive of the broadcast will be available on our website at www.westpharma.com in the investors section. Additionally, you can access a telephone replay through Thursday, November 2, by dialing the numbers and conference ID provided at the end of today\u2019s earnings release. So that concludes today\u2019s call. Thanks, and have a nice day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Quintin. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. As you've seen the press release issued this morning our Q4 performance returned to more typical growth patterns for our Biologics and Generics market units. While we saw a decline in our Pharma business this was balanced by very strong quarter from our contract manufacturing team. If we exclude impacts from the de-consolidation of operations in Venezuela and hurricane related shutdowns, we estimate that organic sales growth would have been 6% for the quarter. Fourth quarter 2017 was also impacted by a discrete tax charge related to the US tax reform legislation that reduced EPS by $0.64; excluding this impact, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS grew by 19%. As we turn to 2018, we expect to see another year of above market sales growth and operating profit margin expansion. The underlying markets we serve have been growing at 2% to 3% in unit growth. Our annual revenue growth rate has consistently outperformed the market. We continue to leverage the demand for our high-value products and contract manufacturing services. Along with the technical and scientific leadership that differentiates West and the industry. This remains our focus for growing our business organically. Let's now turn to the detail of our market unit performances for Q4 and the full year on Slide 4. As noted earlier, we saw a return to double-digit growth in our Biologics market unit in Q4. Biologic customers continue to demand West high-quality product offerings and our growth was led by the adoption of NovaPure products as well as Westar components. We are encouraged that West maintain participation on 100% of the Biologic new molecular entity FDA approvals in 2017. Both large and small biologics customers rely on West and our partner Daikyo for high-quality product and wrap around service offerings such as our regulatory and technical expertise to contain and deliver these exciting new molecules. While West participation in the Biologics market space is strong. Our experience shows that growth is not always linear and quarterly fluctuations occur. Customers often build up stock for launches and follow this with destocking periods, which we saw in 2017. Our commercial teams have been working with our customers to get a better understanding of their needs and timing, which in turn helps our demand planning. For example, we know that Biologics will have a tough comp in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile the full year trends continue to look positive and we'll see a meaningful ramp up in growth as the year progress. We expect to see full year 2018 growth in our biologics market unit of high single to double-digit growth. Our generics market unit had a good finish to the year. Posting high single digits growth in Q4. Full year 2017 sales were flat versus prior year due to previously discussed inventory destocking by several customers. You might also recall the software sales we've experienced in some markets last year due to customer regulatory issues. I'm pleased to say that we feel that most of these issues are behind us and we anticipate a return to a more sustained and consistent growth pattern in 2018. Generics customers continue to communicate their need for speed and simplicity and our AccelTRA program meets both of these needs. In addition to the high-quality that West is known for. This program was launched in 2017 and more than 80 customers were sampled over the course of the year. We now have customers testing for drug compatibility. With several of the largest generic companies moving forward with this unique product offering. We expect to see full year growth in our generics market unit return to mid-to-high single-digit growth rates in 2018. Following the very strong first half of 2017 for our pharma market unit. Sales in the back half of the year moderated. With Q4 sales below the prior year period. For the full year 2017 pharma organically grew mid-single digits which is in line with our expectations on a long-term basis. Looking to 2018, we expect our pharma unit to continue to grow faster than the underlying drug market it serves. With Q1 growth somewhat muted due to a tough comp from the deconsolidation of our former Venezuela operations. Bill will go into more detail in his discussion. And finally, our contract manufacturing business has impressive results throughout 2017 including Q4 where we saw double-digit growth. I'll come back to talk in detail about this market unit in a moment. But first I want to revisit our strategy around high-value product adoption which as I stated earlier is key to our long-term growth. On Slide 5, we show total sales for our proprietary products business over the past five years. In this timeframe we've seen our high-value products grow by 11% annually. In addition, we experienced 100 basis points of volume growth in 2017. The most important thing to take away from this slide is that there is still a great deal of room for us to continue to grow our best-in-class high-value products. With the demanded regulatory backdrop for the packaging and delivery of injectable medicines customers are seeking high-value products now more than ever across all market units. In 2017, we expanded SmartDose portfolio with the introduction of next generation devices. And had good success with the SelfDose Injector. In fact, SelfDose was awarded the Exhibitor Innovation Award at the Annual PharmaPack Meeting in Paris just last week. As we worked and improved adoption of high-value products, growth in this area will also come from volume and price and in the future new product launches. On Slide 6, we highlight three areas of R&D focus for 2018. Advancing our core, delivery devices and administration system products. Our innovation and technology team advanced our core offerings in 2017. While introduced into the market new products like the LyoSeal cap. West Rigid Needle Shields and the NovaGuard SA Pro safety system. All designed to broaden our product offerings in response to unmet customer needs. Together with our partners at Daikyo, we expect to introduce additional high-value products in 2018 that will directly meet our customers demand for high quality. In addition to expand our drug delivery business with the next generation of SmartDose platform and SelfDose we're also working to expand offerings within our drug administration and reconstitution business. With our helping double-digit growth in this product portfolio in 2017 especially in the United States. We expect to expand this offering into new geographic markets, invest in additional capacity for increased production and launch improved products in 2018 and beyond. Together the new products launched over the past five years in these focused areas contributed more than 100 basis points of organic sales growth in 2017 and expect this trend to continue in 2018. Let's turn back to the contract manufacturing side of our business now on Slide 7. Just as we're working to transition our business from standard to high-value product offerings in the proprietary segment in the contract manufacturing business. Our team has been on a journey to transition the focus of our business away from consumer products towards an increase in healthcare products. As you see on the slide, we've grown the healthcare business by 9% annually over the past five years. This growth has come primarily from our drug delivery and diagnostic customers. Resulting in five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. While we have been growing the healthcare business, we have also been deemphasizing our consumer business. As you see in the chart consumer sales have decreased by 2% annually over the last five years. In late 2017, one of our longstanding consumer customers moved production in-house. As a result, we reduced a number of our consumer production lines and will use the resulting capacity to supply the increase in demand from our healthcare customers. Even with this impact, we expect our contract manufacturing business to grow mid-single digits in 2018. On Slide 8, we have highlighted some of the areas of expertise for which customers engage West. Our deep technical insight enables us to support a wide variety of complex products. We are unique and that we also have market leading expertise on the impact of elastomers within the drug delivery devices. Our plant in Dublin, Ireland is a great example of this focus on strategic alignment. We nearly doubled the manufacturing space of our facility in December 2016 to meet increase in demand. The expansion has been operational for one year and is already profitable. The core offering in Dublin includes manufacturing expertise and continuous glucose monitoring devices and is a nice complement to the new insulin sheeting production at our Waterford, Ireland plant which will be initiate commercial operations later this year. Before I turn things over to Bill. I want to spend some time discussing the strong progress we have made in global operations. On Slide 9, we're highlighting some of the teams accomplishments in the first year operating under our unified global operations and supply chain strategy. With 28 sites the team's drive better service to customers. Improve levels of quality and a safer working environment for our team members. In 2017, the team worked through reduced lead times by more than 40% leading to better service for our customers. We continue to improve upon this important metric and plan to reduce times even further in 2018. In addition, we're seeing better quality results, delivering less than 80 out-of-spec parts per billion. In line with our commitment to delivering the highest quality in the industry. We have also accelerated process excellent improvements across the global plant network. So we can deliver value back to our customers and run operations more efficiently. In conjunction with the ongoing global operations strategy, our Board of Directors has approved a restricting program that will streamline the plant network and enable us to make investments to drive growth in high-value proprietary products and healthcare related contract manufacturing business and expand margin. These changes together with executing the commercial and R&D strategies will ensure our business continues to grow within 6% to 8% long-term organic sales growth range. Now I'll turn over to our CFO, Bill Federici who will provide more color on our financial performance and to provide details on our long-term outlook. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you Eric and good morning, everyone. We issued our fourth quarter results this morning. Our Q4 results include the effects of US tax reform which resulted in a discrete charge to reflect the Repatriation Tax on unremitted offshore earnings and the reduction of our US deferred tax assets. Excluding the effects of special items from both this quarter and the prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings were $0.64 per diluted share versus $0.54 we earned in Q4, 2016. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided on Slide 16 through 20. Turning to sales, Slide 11 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. All references to sales announcement to constant currency. Consolidated fourth quarter sales were $415.6 million, an increase of 4.5% over fourth quarter 2016 sales. Proprietary product sales were $306.4 million, a 1.4% increase over same quarter 2016. Sales price increases and the volume mix increase contributed equally to the Q4 sales growth. High-value product sales increased 5.1% versus the prior year quarter. For the full year 2017 high-value product sales increased approximately 4% versus 2016. Our Biologics segment sales increased by double-digit and our generics market unit saw high single-digit growth. But our pharma market unit sales decline low single-digit in the quarter. Combined CZ and SmartDose sales and development activity were $40 million for the full year 2017, a 47% increases versus the prior year 2016. Contract manufactured product sales were $109.2 million, a 14% increase over sales in the prior year quarter as customers ramped up activity in our recently expanded government contract facility. As provided on Slide 12, our Q4, 2017 consolidated gross profit margin was 30.9% versus 32.3% margin we achieved in the fourth quarter, 2016. Proprietary products fourth quarter gross margin of 34.8% is 2.1 margin points lower than the 36.9% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016. The mid-single-digit growth of high-value products sold, modest sales price increases and continued lead savings and planned efficiencies were more than offset by the impact of higher labor, material and overhead costs including under observed overheads in our newer facilities like Waterford, Kinston and Scottsdale which created headwinds for our margin. Contract Manufacturing Product fourth quarter gross margin of 20.1% was 2.5 margin points higher than the prior year quarter due to a favorable sales mix, lean and planned efficiencies and the ramp up of activity in our newly expanded Dublin facility. As reflected on Slide 13, Q4, 2017 consolidated SG&A expense decreased by $2 million compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease is due primarily to lower pension expense, lower achievement levels on incentive comp programs offset by staffing and salary increases. As a percentage of sales Q4, 2017 SG&A expense was 1.7 percentage points less than the prior year period. Slide 14 shows our key cash flow metrics. Our operating cash flow was $263 million for the full year 2017, $44 million more than 2016 due primarily to our improved operating results. Capital additions of roughly $130 million were made in 2017 roughly 60% of the capital spend was our new products and expansion efforts including approximately $26 million in our Waterford manufacturing facility. We expect capital additions of approximately $150 million in 2018. Slide 14 also provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we're confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at year end was $236 million, $33 million higher than our December 2016 balance. Roughly 60% of that cash is invested overseas. The US tax reform bill signed into law late last year mandated a deemed repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction of our deferred tax assets based on reduced federal income tax rate. A discrete tax charge of approximately $49 million is included in our Q4, 2017 GAAP results. Debt at year end was $197 million, $32 million less than at the prior year end due to the repayment of our headquarters term loan. As of yearend, our cash balance exceeds our debt balance and as such we're delevered on a net debt to total invested capital basis. Working capital totaled $464 million at year end, $63 million higher than at the prior year end. Customers continue to push extended payment terms which puts pressure on our working capital. We continue to work with our customers and suppliers as well as our internal inventory levels to manage our working capital investments. We've issued our full year 2018 guidance in this morning's release. As guidance is summarized on Slide 15, our guidance is based on an exchange rate of $1.20 per Euro. Our actual 2017 results were translated at $1.13 per Euro rate. More than half our revenues at generating outside US. US Dollar has weakened versus a number of international currencies most notably the Euro. If this trend holds, currency translation will be a tailwind to earnings in 2018. As a reminder every $0.01 change in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate has approximately $0.01 annual EPS effect. We expect our effective tax rate will decrease by roughly 3 to 4 percentage points as a result in the new US tax legislation. We expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 26% excluding the effects of excess tax benefits from option exercises. Our tax rate is highly dependent on the geographic mix of earnings which in large effect is driven by the sales of high-value products. Our 2018 guidance includes, a $0.02 EPS benefit resulting from our board approved 800,000 share repurchase program. In Q1, 2017 we recorded $0.21 of excess tax benefit from option exercises. Whereas we expect Q1, 2018 benefit from option exercises to be about $0.04 to $0.06. We expect our 2018 results will continue to be adversely impacted by customer inventory management and under absorption of overheads in certain of our newest facilities. In Q2, 2017 we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiary which will create sales and earnings headwinds for Q1. In addition, 2018 will be adversely impacted by one large consumer contract manufactured product that the customer opted to bring in-house. Additionally, the under absorption of overheads from newer facilities is expected to increase by approximately $3 million in Q1 versus the prior year quarter. The combined impact of these items represent an $0.11 tailwind for Q1, 2018. We expect our Q1, 2018 growth mix and operational efficiencies will offset all of these items other than the reduction in the year-over-year stock comp tax benefit. We do not expect any 2018 income from the technology license that occurred in Q3, 2017. During the first half of 2017, our pharma market unit had above average growth and throughout 2017 our contract manufactured market unit grew well in excess of our norms. Setting up tight comps for both of these market units. With growth accelerating throughout 2018 in our generics and biologics market units, we expect a stronger second half of 2018 compared to the first half. All of these items have been considered in our 2018 guidance. We expect to deliver on our full year 2018 earnings guidance of $2.80 to $2.90 per diluted share. Excluding the tax benefit from stock-based comp, this represents an increase of between 14% and 18% in diluted EPS over 2017. Our guidance excludes the restructuring charge of $8 million to $13 million or the expected fully completed annualized savings of $17 million to $22 million outlined in this morning's release. I now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you Bill. In conclusion we're making progress in executing our long-term market lead strategy. Our commercial team has developed an even greater understanding of the underlying market dynamics of our industry and is delivering tailored product and service offerings that meet the unique needs of our discrete customer groups. Our global operations team is driving improved quality, safety and service to our customers and is working to streamline our manufacturing network to make room for investments that will fuel future growth. In our innovation and technology team is building a strong pipeline of integrated containment and delivery products to meet customer needs. We look forward to another year of above market growth and remain committed to our long-term outlook for West. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dave Windley : I think they called on me. At least on my end of the line just FYI. And Eric your concluding remarks there the audio went pretty choppy. I'll start. Eric Green : Sorry. Dave Windley : It sounds like the old Blackberry interference type stuff. So anyway, I wanted to start with questions around the sales performance by market unit by customer unit and just a clarifying question first, that I guess as I think about the relative size of the units. I'm having a little bit of hard time understanding how double-digit biologics, high single-digit generics and then offset by low single-digit pharma nets to only 1.4% growth, is there something that I'm not taking into account and thinking about those net together. Bill Federici : Hi Dave, it's Bill. I think you're thinking about it correctly. You have to remember that the size of those business units are slightly different and the growth is relatively as you said double-digit for the biologics and high single for generics. The pharma business which is the largest of those business was actually low single-digit decline. So when you add all of those things together you get to your 1.4% in proprietary. Now if you remember then the issue that are effecting those as Eric said on the call. There were some inventory destocking that was going by customers. There was a product that was pulled from the market by the customer, so there are some special items that are impacting that and when you take those in the Venezuela impact on our proprietary organization the Q4 growth rate for proprietary products will be somewhere in the 5% and 5.5% range. Quintin Lai : Dave, I think we may be losing you here. Operator, let's go to the next caller. Dave, if you can just come back in the queue and maybe the line will clear up for you. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Tim Evans : Bill, can you just for everyone walk through what exactly happened in Venezuela? Why did you have to deconsolidate this facility? Is it something where the volume moves somewhere else or is it something where you just don't get the volume anymore? And then lastly, exactly how much revenue did it do in Q4, 2016 and how much did it do in Q1, 2017 so we can understand the comp? Bill Federici : Okay, great. So Venezuela as you know has been suffering from very, very high inflation and a lack of ability in that country of getting cash out of the country. So many, many of the companies that serve in Venezuela have deconsolidated their subsidiaries. We hung on as long as we could, we hung on through all of 2016 when a lot of companies have bailed and through the first quarter, but at that point in time we had - been almost a year since we had received any cash payments out of the country and we deemed that point in time that our asset, our ability to control our subsidiary was no longer there. So under GAAP rules we are required to deconsolidate, what that means, is that we took a charge it was a deconsolidation charge of about $11 million relative to our Venezuelan subsidiary and we no longer from that point forward have any income or expense associated with that. We're serving those customers, many of them anyway from other parts of our South American operations. So we've not lost customers other than customers who have gone out of business or have diverted elsewhere. Some of these customers that asked us to sell through Brazil and others of our South American operations. So we have not lost the business per se. In terms of the actual financial results in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the fourth quarter of 2016 the sales differential was $3.5 million less in 2017, Q4 than 2016, Q4. In Q1, 2017 we had $9.1 million of sales in Venezuela that we will have none in 2018's first quarter. Tim Evans : So I guess this is where the confusion comes in, right. So if you had $9 million of sales in Q1, 2017 and some of that business is effectively been moved to other sites in South America, why is it zero in Q1, 2018? Bill Federici : It's a demand issue. So when you have - we've been selling them. We had stocked up a lot of inventory through that time period and we have been - customers are ordering a whole lot in that area and we are serving them with the existing inventory on the ground. We don't have - there's been some of that $9 million has been will be made up in Q1, but not a tremendous amount. Tim Evans : And this is standard products that go mostly to large pharma customers? Bill Federici : Standard products that go to large pharma customers. Yes. Tim Evans : Okay, you usually call out committed orders for the proprietary I didn't hear that. Did I miss it or? Bill Federici : No, it's $377 million which is roughly 1% on a currency mutual basis higher than the same period in 2016. Tim Evans : Okay, lastly. Can you walk through the dynamics of Q1 EPS? I think you said there was going to be $0.11 year-over-year headwind. But then you said you'd offset all of it except for the stock comp accounting. What does that net do? Bill Federici : Okay, so when you think about let's take them into two pieces. So the stock comp will go first. The stock compensation expense in Q1, 2017 was $0.21. We are projecting for two reasons a lot smaller number in 2018. The first reason is that, now that the tax rate is 21%, not 35%. The actual benefit you'll derive from stock - we as a company will derive from those stock option exercises will be about a third less. Secondly, we had a number in 2017 of our - of large option exercises deep in the money options that have either because they're getting ready to expire, so a lot of those have already gone through the system. So we expect a smaller pool of, we have a smaller pool of option benefits to be earned over the next several years. So our estimate is only $0.04 to $0.06 for option - the tax benefit from our production [ph] sizes in Q1, 2018. So take that and put that aside. Okay. Tim Evans : Yes. Bill Federici : Because that is the first decline. The second one is, when you look at the Venezuela impact, the impact of that consumer product customer and some of these under absorbed overheads that we talked about and their impact Q1, 2018 versus Q1, 2017 will be about $0.11. We fully expect that our growth in operations, our favorable mix from generics and the biologics space coming back. And our operational efficiencies will help us offset the $0.11, but that net delta between the $0.21 of excess tax benefits versus the $0.04 to $0.06 we believe will happen in the first quarter of 2018 we do not believe that we will be able to overcome that. Tim Evans : So just to be very clear about $0.15 to $0.17 lower than Q1, 2018. Bill Federici : Correct. Tim Evans : Okay, that's good. All right turn it over to others. Thanks. Quintin Lai : Operator, can we go back to Dave? If he's back on the line. Operator : Yes. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dave Windley : I call back you on my cell phone, so look - I'll get your answer to the first question off the transcript, but I wanted to continue to clarify a couple of things. So you guys said 100 basis points. I think Eric talked about 100 basis points of volume growth in high-value products in 2017. Should I think about that in the frame work of the like 83% standard, 17% high-value that shift in mix is continuing at 100 basis points? Is that what that means? Eric Green : That's correct. It's 100 basis point shift from standard to high-value products on a per unit basis. That's correct. Dave Windley : Yes and so, am I because I'm thinking about with the inventory destocking some of the tougher year-over-year comps etc., that the high-value product and a kind of an isolation high vale product growth was relatively low, by comparison to prior years. I guess I would have thought that I certainly want to see that mix shift continue, but I would have thought 2017 would have been a little bit of weak year on that front. Eric Green : Yes, absolutely so when you look at the volume component, we had - when you take a look at the volume component of the standard of about 83% back in 2016 that was about 100% impact going into for high-value products for this particular year, 2017. There is a shift between the different market units which would drive some of that behavior. So to give you [technical difficulty] biologics customers they tend to be the higher quality materials all NovaPure offering, but much smaller units and that particular part of the [indiscernible]. Dave Windley : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe continuing with that as you mentioned NovaPure, I think Westar was another one. You highlighted a couple quarters ago I believe that one of your large - a large biopharma customer with a fairly substantial injectable product portfolio had made the decision to transition the high-value products over a period of time understanding that's multi-year effort. But I guess I'm curious on maybe high level update as to how that - what the cadence of that transition will be roughly and is it right to think that, having the customer make a big decision like that would accelerate that 100 basis points shift a year, that you could actually see that being a little bit higher for a period of time while that's happening. Eric Green : That's a good point. So we're on track with that particular customer, which we won't name. But it is approximately a little over two-year process doing the transition completely. A little bit less volume in year one and you've seen year two, so this should be more in acceleration. It requires our customer be onsite to do [indiscernible] validation and also their documentation. So we're well on track. We're seeing the conversion occurring and we're quite pleased by this particular conversion. We do think this will help us with our discussions with other customers to transition from standard to high-value products with their existing portfolio of other large pharmas. So we're on track. There could be a potential uptick as we talk about number of units moving from standard to high-value products as we look into 2018 and little beyond that due to the step of transition. Dave Windley : Okay and last one and I'll drop. Bill you emphasized that you're now basically in a net cash position small. What are the major thoughts about levels of debt that you're comfortable kind of based on recent pattern that you seem zero, net debt. But I guess I'm wondering particularly is there an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive and opportunistic on the share repurchase side of things. Now that you're in a position where CapEx is trended on the low end of your range or your P&L is growing, you're going to generate more cash flow and you don't have a lot of debt. Eric Green : I'll start talking little bit about the use of cash because that's a very good comment in regards to - our number focus is around investing in the organic growth and you're absolutely correct, when you sort of - when you look at CapEx spend in 2017 is roughly around $130 million in prior year, so it's - was north of that. And kind of seeing there results to we do have a couple of facilities that are state-of-the-art customers are excited transfer projects into those sites, but they're underutilized at this point and so we believe, we'll continue to invest in organic growth, but because of our global operations approach that they're taking with more of network approach we feel comfortable that. We're looking at below the 150 that we've mentioned. The second area that is we're starting to put more emphasis around is, now that the team's aligned around our innovation, technology group. You'll see while the number is still as a percent of sales below 3% we're trying to continue to invest in that area in double-digit growth. We're very encouraged with the pipeline and the type of payout that's happening in the next three to five years. One last comment, we will continue to look at both on technologies and tuck-in type of acquisitions that we really broaden our portfolio to really drive the vision of integrated containment and delivery devices for injectable medicines. We don't have 100% complete portfolio as you know and we're working on ways to leverage innovation or through bolt-on opportunities to bring that in the fold. I'll let Bill talk real quickly about the debt and how we use cash also around share buyback and dividends. Bill Federici : Eric is absolutely right. The other two items in the mix there are, we do pay dividends, Dave as you know it's you know in the 40 million-ish range now on an annual basis and we're just 800,000 share buyback for the year 2018 that we hope for effect. In terms of debt and our thoughts about debt. Yes, you're right we're de-levered but we're not adverse to debt if there were strategic opportunities that were out there from a bolt-on perspective as Eric mentioned or if we see opportunities to invest elsewhere in our network. We certainly will do that and as I said, we're not debt adverse. We just happen to be in a delevered state right now. Dave Windley : Okay, thank you. I'll drop out. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : So I guess can we say that now Puerto Rico is behind us, de-stocking is behind us. Is that done and taken care of so to speak? Eric Green : Yes, Paul it's a good question. Puerto Rico is behind us. And I would just real quick comment about Puerto Rico, our site is operating and our customers on the island of Puerto Rico we're importing at this point. So we believe that is truly behind us. In fact, we will continue to invest in our Puerto Rico site because it's actually one of our top producing sites per performance. In regards to de-stocking, I'm really pleased on how we've been able to come out of the situation with the generics side and as you know, there was customer inventory builds, they were de-stocking. We do see normalized levels. We have visibility. We're pretty comfortable there. Biologics we will see a little bit up and down fluctuations based on product launches. When they're about to launch new molecule they'll come to us and we'll help them, build inventory. But the positive part there is, you know Paul very well is that the pipeline of molecules tend to be more biologics, so we should see that to be very healthy for us. So I would say there's less de-stocking type activities. We do hear one last thing Paul I add. This 40% reduction on lead times, is significant. And our customers have noted it, they've been very pleased. And now are head of operations, where the commercial heads have announced to customers and they continue to talk about how do they reduce their own safety stock to drive working capital improvements at their own facilities. So we'll have some oscillations as we go for next few quarters, but it's a very good reason why that's happening and I think for long-term we're in a very good position. Paul Knight : Okay and then can you give us an update on Crystal Zenith. What's the customer involvement there etc.? Eric Green : Yes as far as the number of - the interest level remains strong. We have various projects that are in either in Phase 1, 2 or 3. We have several that are really in the development early on discovery phase at this point. So the interest level remains strong. I'll tell you though, it really is a focused niche area that we have been going after because it won't display, it's all glass. So we're pleased especially in the biologics space we're actually seeing some of our pharma customers exploring because the size, the variability that we can provide in larger scale and so that is our option that we have at this point in time. Paul Knight : And then last Bill, could you give us a little color on where Q1 growth and up margins are going year-over-year? Bill Federici : We expect for the full year that we will be able to increase margins. We will have those headwinds as we suggested Paul and I lined out all of those things. So we should be able to offset as I mentioned the Venezuela impact, the impact from that consumer customer and our overhead under absorption issues with mix growth and operational efficiencies. So we feel very, very comfortable that on - for the full year that we'll be expanding margins. The first quarter because of the headwinds that we faced, that we were talking through happens to be very, very pronounced so again we feel comfortable with the full year outlook. The first quarter will be continue to be margin will continue to be soft. Paul Knight : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Dana Flanders with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Dana Flanders : My first one here and apologies if I missed it. Did you guys give just the high-value product organic growth this quarter? And then as we look at 2018 I know 2016 you guys were lapping some tough comps, should we expect that to accelerate as we head into 2018. Bill Federici : Yes so I'll answer first question, first. For the fourth quarter our highlighted product growth was right around 5%, as I mentioned in the script. And for 2018, we mentioned that we'll see high-value products accelerating in the back half of the year as biologics and generics come back. So we believe that we will have more normal growth in our high-value products for the year, we expect high singles to low doubles. Dana Flanders : Okay, great. And then just my second one quickly here. I know you announced modest restructuring program not included in EPS guidance. How should we think about just the magnitude of savings over the course of 2018, is that more 2019 weighted? Bill Federici : Yes, absolutely. So and Dana thank you for the question. In a regulated environment that we operate in, it is very, very difficult to move product around the network. There is validation protocols with the customer etc. So these things take a long time. Historically that's why we talk in the 12 to 24 months category for when we expect to see those savings. We will see my guess and you know the way it works, is you can only take the charge and you get the savings then once those activities are actually exited which we believe will start to happen towards the back half of 2018. So the savings they maybe a little bit in the back half of 2018, but certainly not a substantial amount and most of that will come through in 2019 and beyond. It will be an annual effect. Dana Flanders : Okay, great. That was it from me. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Most of my questions have been answered, just a few clarifications. So on just to take you back on net savings. It sounds like you're not building although you may get a little bit in the back half on Q4. You're not building it anything in your actual guidance for 2018, right? Bill Federici : Right. Larry Solow : Okay and then the total of $0.15 to $0.20 or so it looks like that the math. And that sounds like we'll get that full impact, some of it 19, but annualized we'll probably get that full impact by 2020. Bill Federici : Yes, absolutely. Larry Solow : Great and on the improved capacity, 40% reduction lead times. Obviously a little - success on the backlog side. Backlog sort of flat. Going forward should we, is backlog no longer as good of an indicator as it was maybe a couple years ago before you sort of had this surge of supply orders. How should we view that now that I looks like your capacity is or your improved capacity is somewhat normalized? Eric Green : Larry it's a good question because of the lead times have been reduced significantly. I mean talking matter of each nine, ten weeks in some cases reduction. Our customers are actually not ordering as much in advance. So if I take a look at giving example. If you take a look at end of January. The growth of the backlog for Q1 delivery again just to be clear though. The backlog isn't the entire growth of the business to sub-segment is up about 10%. So there's a good indicator from a short-term period and that's where the shift will occur. We're not going to have larger backlogs going forward because of the fact their lead times are significantly less than the constant level from our customers that we can deliver consistently as we said we would is a very high percentage at this point in time. So we got to be little bit careful looking at what we looked at three, four, five years of backlog is a true way to get at this point of time. Larry Solow : Right. Okay so it sounds it might be little, what period of shakeout until we could sort of better analyze that number, if you will but it sounds like your read outside the backlog sounds consistent and remains positive. Okay, great. Just switching gears little bit. Obviously high-value products little bit volatility during the quarter-to-quarter but all in it sounds like, you finished the year pretty good. Did you just - pharma obviously down, I think a little bit more than expected maybe in this quarter? Did you give an outlook for 2018? And quote the outlook on biologics and generics, but I didn't quite hear the pharma one and maybe that skewed by that as well - more to. Eric Green : Yes, Larry it's a little bit, what you just commented. Let me put it into - look at pharma and the issue that we had in Q4. Some of these are predictable, some are not predictable and/or forecastable [ph] with our customers. The one was we had a decline, with one of our clients in - drug molecules taken off in the European market which had an impact on one of our containment closures. And we also saw in this particular area what we call tooling, so we do a lot of work with our customers and we provide tooling in our pharma business and the demand was quite noticeable difference between Q4 of 2016 versus 2017 which - it's quite a large number. We had Venezuela on top of that. I know Bill mentioned earlier when you bring these elements back, plus the Venezuela to our base we're roughly on little over 5% growth in that pharma business. So that was - the impact was in Q4. It wasn't clearly visible to us at the time we were talking with you in October unfortunately we continue to work on the visibility and the transparency to our investment community in regards to the future demands. Larry Solow : Okay, great and then on the gross margin. On quarter little bit less than expected, you offset by lower SG&A and realized it's explainable again little bit over your - success on the new capacity coming online and under absorption. It sounds like you expect to improve upon that in 2018, but still have some drag from under absorption, is that fair to say? Eric Green : That is absolutely right way to say it, Larry. Larry Solow : Okay and I guess sort of hard to time, but I guess as you continue to grow and overtime hopefully that will switch to. Bill Federici : Absolutely and you know having excess capacity while it's a drag now is a good thing as you go into the future in a growing business where you can satisfy that demand for highest quality products in these plants that are specifically designed to give our customers the highest value of products that we can offer. Larry Solow : Excellent and then on the in sourcing of the plastics contract. It sounds like that business obviously has become quite sort of non-core going forward and less of a focus. This one contract it looks like little over $20 million, $23 million, $24 million. Is that a lower margin contract? And is this something that you expect additional contracts that come off overtime. I realize this is getting small as a whole, but any color on that. Eric Green : Yes, Larry I mean obviously we want to bill, service all of our customers. In this particular case, our client we've been working with for a long, long period of time [indiscernible] in sourcing. So it having impact in our consumer part of the business. But it's an area to be - we de-emphasize this area strategically as we put investments in place. But you're correct when you said it is a lower margin business. The consumer business going forward without this, the one we're talking about is roughly around $60 million and it will be declining slightly as you've seen over the last five years. So that's your magnitude of that business as of today. Just to remind you, as well 50% of the business was consumer will be acquired tech group about 10 years ago. So this has been a shift especially over the last several years. Larry Solow : Okay, great. Thank you very much guys. Operator : Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik De Bruin : Sorry, I'm traveling and jumped on late. So my apologies if you hit this, but just to sort of follow-up on the last question. So what's the outlook for the gross margin for the different segments for 2018? Just trying to think about how the dynamics work, given all the moving pieces. Bill Federici : Thanks Derik for your question. On the contract manufacturing side we'll continue to see margins benefiting from the move away from consumer and towards more of our device and diagnostic businesses in pharma, so that will continue to be and operational efficiencies. Longer term we still feel very, very comfortable with the overall ability to grow organically and expand margins as Eric mentioned in this comment Derik. That will be for 2018 we talked about the headwinds that are impacting us in Q1, 2018 and that the fact that, both biologics and generics are building as the year goes, so as you know we will get to we believe for the full year high-value product growth in the high single to low doubles in the back half of the year, but in the front half that will be a, will continue to be challenged. So margins in the first quarter will continue to be challenged. Derik De Bruin : Okay and I guess just from a - just some question and my apologies you already answered these. I guess how does the FX impact of the top line for the full year and what's that gain on the margin level just from FX and I know there are some changes in pension accounting rules. I'm [indiscernible] M&A effect on the margin as well. Bill Federici : Yes that will have an effect on the margin as well. It's a good point, the pension accounting change. For us in the - you're talking about low to mid-single millions of dollars, so it's not like it's a violent change, but it is a change and it's strictly an accounting change, you're just reclassing [ph] from one area of the P&L to another. But it does have an impact on the margin. On the - I'm sorry what was the first? Derik De Bruin : FX. Bill Federici : So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the FX we are - we've budgeted the guidance we have prepared is at $1.20 per Euro. Last year's full year effect was $1.13 per Euro Derik and that's each one $0.01 is roughly a million, it's a little over, over $0.01 of EPS. So little bit more than that. So you're talking about going from that $0.07 between $0.05 and $0.07 where is the range what you should expect from FX. If it were to hold, at a $1.20 for the whole year, which we know it won't but that's kind of the stake in the ground, you have to put. Derik De Bruin : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our last question is from Dave Windley. Your line is now open. Dave Windley : I'm coming back for three. A couple more clarification, so am I right in thinking that after the third quarter or through the third quarter your year-over-year pattern in high-value product orders was negative that because of the reduction in wait times that you would actually see a negative year-over-year pattern and then, at the end of December you're back to kind of 1% improvement in that pattern such that the fourth quarter itself would represent quite a strong catch up. Am I thinking about that correctly? Bill Federici : The general commentary is correct. We expect over an average year Dave as you know the construct says that, we expect about 100 basis points of margin expansion due to mix shift, a little bit of price and the operational efficiencies and volume obviously. So we see that over long periods of time we're impacted as we know in the individual quarters by the inventory de-stocking and the building. We talked about the first half of 2018 being more severely impacted by things like Venezuela than the back half. We also talked about the fact that biologics and generics as they come back to more normal order patterns it's going to be towards the back half, the back half of the year. So yes you're - what we're counting on and we're guiding to is a high single to low double-digit growth in high-value products for the year, but that will be challenged in the first part of the year. Dave Windley : Okay, next follow-up is. Coming out of 2016 we had what 22 drug approvals of which maybe 25% of those five, six something like that were injectable. 2017 we had 46 approvals of which significantly more maybe 10, 11, 12 were injectables or more maybe it was even 20. So significant improvement in overall approvals and a commensurate increase in injectables that you care about. You already talked about how you had a 100% coverage of biologic approvals. What's the cadence? What's the timing with regard to when approvals then drive? Order patterns and revenue uptick for you in injectable products and should we be thinking about that being a big driver of your ramp up in 2018. Eric Green : Yes, so there's two areas that we look at, one is, there is a ramp up. Where they get approval and launch into the market place. So it's roughly about a year lead time you get into the marketplace, into the distribution channel. The second thing just to be aware - we're seeing while there's a tremendous increase in number of molecules going through the approval process more recently, we have seen in some cases smaller volumes per drug molecule. In some therapies there have been launch recently which are very exciting obviously and very effective for patient, but the volume is they're just quite small. So we have to balance it. It's not the ratio is not 1 :1 with every molecule it does very - biologics tends to be smaller volumes, while the obviously the generics and pharma is larger. Dave Windley : Okay and then final question. On the restructuring I just want to make sure I understand because you got both a restructuring charge, you got CapEx that you were going to spend for that and then a savings amount that you expect to get. Just operationally are we talking about having identified a facility that you're able to completely take offline and exit and shutdown and then in order to do that, you got to do some build out and some other places to absorb that productive volume, that productive capacity before you can do that? Is that in fact what you're executing? Bill Federici : Yes, so the idea is exactly what you said to move certain of our products for certain customers into consolidate into some locations. A couple of those locations will actually close, but it will take some time to do that as you can imagine with regulated products, there will be some capital needed. We mentioned in the release $9 million to $14 million that's a very modest amount that we believe will happen over the course of 2018 and 2019 and then as we migrate those products over and those customers over, then we will have the opportunity to exit those facilities and those activities. So as you know it's - because of the regulated nature it takes a little bit of time to do these things that why we've estimated 12 to 24 months. So we don't expect a whole lot of savings in 2018, a little bit at the back and through 2019. Dave Windley : And is the recipient of this volume, are you able to come - is this part of moving the volume into kind of centers of excellence and kind of more call it super regional hubs like a Waterford or someplace like that? Eric Green : Yes, so what we're doing through aligning towards our global operations strategy that we outlined last year where we basically consolidated centers of excellence. So you're actually correct, we're pooling the resource and the technologies and capabilities into more discreet locations. This gives us an opportunity to run more efficiently. So it's really moving towards more strategic sites and as you know we have 28 today on [indiscernible] so we do have some opportunities. Dave Windley : Okay, thanks. Operator : And we're showing no further questions. Quintin Lai : Thank you for joining us on today's conference call.

I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President Eric Green. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Quintin, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported our first quarter performance. And you have seen in our press release we grew overall sales despite the headwinds and the tough first quarter comparison that we forecasted at the beginning of the year. Our generics market unit posted another quarter of accelerating growth. In our Contract Manufacturing segment also saw impressive growth in the quarter. There are positive signs of future growth across all market units and we\u2019re confident in the underlying strength of our business as we look to the remainder of 2018. Let\u2019s now turn to the detail of our market unit performances for the first quarter. On Slide 4, we show the organic sales growth performance of each of the three market units in our Proprietary Product segment and our Contract Manufacturing segment. As we have done on previous calls, we show the trailing four quarters along the current quarterly performance. While we adjust for last year's sales associated with both the deconsolidation of the Venezuela business and lower consumer contract manufacturing sales due to our customer moving their business in-house, our organic sales growth would have been 4.1%. I'll start with generics which represents an excellent example of the resilience of our business. Looking back, we saw the first signs of a slowdown due to customer inventory management beginning in late 2016. By Q3 of 2017, we start to see early indications of return to normal growth. Since then, we\u2019ve reported accelerating growth for the past three quarters. Order patterns from our largest customers gave us confidence for the rest of the year. Another encouraging sign is a strong rebound in sales growth we're seeing in India. On the new product front, we are encouraged to see numerous sampling requests for our AccelTRA component program, a high-quality product offering that is built around the most critical and fundamental customer needs for quality, speed, and simplicity. We are also seeing increased customer activity around our patient controlled self injection platform SelfDose, as companies seek technologies that make it easier for patients to self inject. These and other initiatives are seen in the market for future growth. For the full-year of 2018, we expect generics organic sales growth in the high single-digits. Turning to Pharma. The sales growth pattern is similar to what we saw with generics over the past two years. Pharma saw customer inventory management issues impacting results beginning in 2017. But our order book has stabilized now and we expect to see sales growth acceleration for the remainder of the year. Within the Pharma market unit, there's increase in demand for a universal vial transfer system. To address this, we are adding manufacturing capacity for a Vial2Bag administration system. And this capacity comes online throughout the year. It will contribute to the anticipated growth we expect. We are also encouraged with the outlook of HVP adoption of FluroTec, Westar RS, Envision, and NovaPure components. For Pharma, we're planning for mid single-digit organic sales growth for the full-year with a balanced revenue stream throughout the year. Looking at Biologics, the past two quarters illustrate the quarterly variability primarily driven by launch plans, as well as active stock adjustment programs at large customers. A strong double-digit growth in Q4 was aided by commercial launch activities that did not occur in Q1. To address the challenges we have experienced with inventory management activities of our customers, we have been working closer with the supply chain of our larger customers to better anticipate the timing of demand. Understand the complexities of these supply chain is leading to better transparency and in fact helped us forecast last quarter that Q1 will be soft for Biologics. Using the same methodology, we see a more stable outlook for Q2 in Biologics an accelerating growth for the remainder of the year. We are making good progress with the supply chain partnership program. Given the start in Biologics, full-year growth will likely be in the mid single to high single-digit growth range. However, as we look to the future we remain confident in the strength of this business. We continue to maintain a strong market position with excellent participation on FDA molecular entity approvals. Our high-value components are the go to standard for Biologics and biosimilar customers. And demand is building and forecast to grow throughout the year. High-value product adoption remains the key focus for Biologics and for all our market units. We are seeing good adoption rates for NovaPure components, Envision expected components and our administration systems. These products are key to addressing the challenges our customers are facing across all market units. They represent our highest quality offering and therefore yield better margins for the business. We expect high single to low double-digit growth for our HVP portfolio for the full-year. Turning to Contract Manufacturing. We had another strong quarter of sales growth. Our CMT was doing a great job of providing our customers with expertise in high precision, high-volume injection molding and assembling. A great example is our recently expanded Dublin Ireland facility. Just few weeks ago, I toured the facility and was impressed with the level of activity. It was less than two years ago when we expanded to a second building. Now that building is running on all cylinders and we\u2019re looking to meet growing demand with further expansion within our current footprint. At the same time, our business is continuing to evolve to meet the needs of our customers we serve. As an example, we\u2019ve recently added new capabilities such as cold storage drug handling in Arizona and will soon be installing same technology in Ireland. These new capabilities accelerate our strategy to provide strategic and high-value products and services for our CM customers. We expect continued progress in 2018 with high single-digit growth for the year. While our commercial team continues to engage customers, and what is most important to them in terms of products and services, as noted on Slide 5, our operations team is also focused on improving the customer experience across all segments and units. Our unified global manufacturing team is working across all our sites to improve safety, quality and service to our customers, while reducing overall costs. We are seeing good progress on each of our key performance metrics and our previously announced restructuring program is on track. We are looking forward to delivering the first commercial sales in our newly constructed Waterford site, in Ireland later this year. We are also working to transfer high-value product technology to Waterford, so we can serve customers even more fully from the state-of-the-art site in the future. Waterford is now part of our unmatched global manufacturing footprint through which we are delivering industry-leading lead times with the highest level of quality. I'm especially pleased to see how our teams are working to continuously improve our performance in the future to exceed our customer's expectations. With Q1 behind us, we're well-positioned for the remainder of 2018. We are reaffirming our full-year 2018 organic sales growth guidance of 6% to 8%, and we are reaffirming our overall sales and adjusted EPS guidance. Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bill Federici, who will provide more color on our financial performance and to provide details on our long-term outlook. Bill? Bill Federici : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We issued our results this morning, reporting first quarter 2018 earnings of $43.6 million, or $0.58 per diluted share versus the $0.81 per diluted share we reported in the first quarter of '17. Our Q1 '18 reported results include $3.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share of restructuring and other charges resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.62. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures are described in Slide 12 to 14. Our Q1, 2018 reported results also include $2.1 million or $0.03 of EPS tax benefit associated with share-based payments whereas Q1, 2017 included $15.9 million or $0.21 EPS tax benefit. Our results for Q1, 2018 were impacted by the new revenue recognition rules and the new pension expense classification rules. While the new pension rules had no net impact on EPS, the new revenue recognition rules accelerated the recognition of certain of our revenues. The adverse impact to our Q1, 2018 sales was $3 million and we expect the full-year adverse sales impact will be approximately $6 million. Our working capital has been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the acceleration of revenue recognition. The adverse impact on Q1 working capital was approximately $3 million or two days. Turning to sales. Slide 7 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Consolidated first quarter sales were $415.7 million, excluding the currency translation effects and the effects of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary and the lost consumer products contract manufacturing customer, our consolidated Q1, 2018 sales would have increased by 4.1% versus the prior year quarter. Proprietary product sales increased 1.3% versus the same quarter in 2017 excluding exchange effects and the effects of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Sales price increases accounted for just over 1% of the sales increase in the current quarter. Our high-value product components and systems sales increased 2.2% versus the prior year quarter. While our generics market unit business saw a return to high single digits in the current quarter, as expected, the current quarters HVP sales were adversely impacted by customer inventory management, especially in our Pharma and Biologics market units. The current quarter's HVP sales as a percentage of total proprietary sales were essentially flat versus the prior year quarter and represented more than 55% of our total proprietary product Q1 2018 sales. For the full-year 2018, we expect high single to low double-digit sales growth in high-value products. CZ and SmartDose sales were $9 million in the current quarter $8 million in the prior year quarter. Contract manufactured product net sales increased by 7.9% X currency versus the prior year quarter despite the loss of a consumer product business customer. A favorable mix of products sold, volume increases and pricing drove the increase in Q1, 2018 sales. This quarter's growth was favorably impacted by continued strong demand for some customer projects in our Dublin facility. We expect high single-digit sales growth in contract manufacturing for the full-year 2018. As provided on Slide 8, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q1 2018 was 32.3% versus the 34.6% margin we achieved in the first quarter of '17. Excluding the adverse effect of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan sub, the lost consumer products contract manufactured customer and the under absorbed overheads in Waterford, our Q1 2018 gross profit margin would had increased 20 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Proprietary products first quarter gross margin of 37.1% was 220 basis points lower than the 39.3% achieved in the first quarter of '17. The decrease in gross margin is due to the unfavorable mix of products sold, the under absorbed overheads in Waterford, the Venezuelan deconsolidation, partially offset by increased prices and operational efficiencies in another facility. Contract manufactured products first quarter gross margin decreased by 150 basis points to 14.8% compared to the prior year quarter. The current quarter's lower gross margin is primarily due to the adverse effect of the lost consumer product customer, partially offset by the favorable mix of products sold and operational efficiencies in our Dublin facility. As reflected on Slide 9, Q1 2018 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $5.9 million versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, first quarter 2018 SG&A expense was 16.4% versus 16.1% in the first quarter of '17. Foreign currency exchange increased SG&A expenses by $2.3 million. We also experienced higher compensation expense, including merit increases and increased outside service costs offset by less SG&A associated with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations in Q2 2017. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $45 million for the current quarter, $24 million more than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting a $20 million voluntary pension contribution made in the prior year quarter. Our capital spending was $28 million in the current quarter. We expect to spend less than $150 million in capital in 2018. More than half of our planned capital spending is dedicated to new products and expansion initiates. Slide 10 also provides some summary balance sheet information. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we're confident that our business will provide necessary future liquidity. Our cash balance at March 31st of $200 million was $36 million less than our December 2017 balance. Approximately $48 million of our cash was used to buyback 540,000 shares of our common stock under the Board authorized year buyback plan. Yet at March 31st, of $198 million is roughly the same level as at the year-end. And on a net debt to total invested capital ratio basis, we are essentially delevered. Working capital of $480 million at March 31 with $16 million higher than at year-end, the majority of the increase is due to the decrease in our cash balances, being more than offset by increases in our receivables related to the growth of our business and the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting rules as well as less accounts payable and accrued expenses at this quarter's end. Our committed proprietary product orders of $428 million at March 2018 were 11% higher than at year-end, but 3% lower than the March 2017 orders excluding exchange due to the current reduced order lead times. Turning to Slide 11, we are reaffirming our full-year 2018 sales and EPS guidance range reflecting the favorable Q1, 2018 foreign currency exchange rate, offset by less Q1, 2018 excess tax benefit on stock transactions than we had previously anticipated. We expect our 2018 full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 26% excluding the impact of the tax benefit from option exercises. Despite the euro exchange, spot rate increased to $1.22 per euro, we have conservatively based our guidance on an exchange rate of $1.20 per euro, the same rate used in our prior guidance. Our 2018 guidance excludes any expected additional expense associated with our restructuring program. I now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Bill. Before we close, I want to share some customer feedback. We recently wrote to the panel of global customers representing all our business segments and market units. We asked these customers to provide feedback on our performance and what makes for an ideal industry partner. They talked about the criticality of high-quality, security of supply and scientific excellence. And we're pleased that West rated highly in all those fronts. Importantly, they talked about wanting a partner who could help them differentiate their products to offer more value to patients. They want flexible dosing, wearable devices, connectivity, digitization and innovation. They\u2019re also looking for suppliers that added samples of long drug development cycle and the need for speed and flexibility and how best to partner along the way. At West, we're proud of our long-standing partnership with the injectable drug industry that these customers represent. In fact, earlier this month, we celebrated our 95th year on business. And while we have celebrated that milestone, our focus is on what the next 95 years will bring, and how we can continue to grow our business into the future. As we look to the rest of 2018, our focus is on execution. We're working with our customers across all the markets to deliver products and services that meet their unique needs. Our global operations team is working to improve safety, quality and service for customers, while reducing our overall costs, and we\u2019re anticipating the future and what our customers and their patients will need as we develop new products and new capabilities to service them. Our market led approach is resonating with our customers and we're confident we will continue to see future growth for the remainder of the year. Brian, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Windley : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to try to understand a little bit better on sales growth since you might imagine. Follow your -- I was looking at the slide around your tracking of growth by end market segment and thinking about how you get from the .2% in the first quarter to this 6% to 8% for the full-year. And if you could just kind of walk me through that perhaps particularly focusing on Biologics, but walk me through that by client segment would be very helpful. Thank you. Eric Green : Yes. David, good morning. Thanks for the question. I will start with the Biologics area. As we commented on is that this particular part of the business we\u2019re seeing some variability because of when customers are buying high-value products, starting their clinical phase for evaluation such as line trials or part of the delivery system, are being developed specific [indiscernible] events of anticipated approvals. So when the launches occur there is a buildup and then there's a -- there's somewhat at the way until a replenishment of the inventory, so we\u2019re seeing a little bit of variability in the Biologics. Saying that, we are pretty confident when we start looking at the order book and future projects we are currently working on in Q2, Q3, and Q4. That gives us confidence that we're able to drive a organic performance of mid single to high single-digits for the full-year. In the Pharma sector, that particular market unit, if you strip out the headwind they had in Q1 specifically around Venezuela which not all of that, a good portion of the Venezuela operations was under Pharma. And as you know when that shutdown with minimal revenue coming back to West going into that market with those operations not working. So we sort of thinking about the Pharma uptick and the high-value products. We also see the administration system business over capacity constraint today will be additional capacity online starting this quarter. And we will be able to push that through to our customers who are pulling the demand today for us. So the Pharma we\u2019re feeling much more comfortable that we were back to our typical growth rates. And we will look at the revenues, it's more stabilized each quarter versus the fluctuation. Just to finalize on the generics, the generics has come -- has came back as we anticipated, but actually a little bit stronger virtually, but the outlook is even greater. The reason why I would say little stronger than we anticipated, we didn\u2019t anticipate India to come back as fast as it did in Q1. That was a very strong performance. In fact, all of Asia was well -- very, very strong growth across all of Asia Pacific for us. So we believe the generics base will continue to deliver as we\u2019ve seen this quarter, but going forward. So if you bring that all together, that gives us little bit higher than that 6% to 8% quarter for Proprietary. So the full average for the full-year is 6% to 8%. I\u2019m not going to say much for contract manufacturing, that's pretty much isolated, you can see it. But Dave, last comment, high-value products is the key driver of that growth. So we're -- as we look at into the next three quarters, we\u2019re looking at growth rates of high single low double-digits with a high-value product portfolio. David Windley : So just to clarify, I mean, from -- numerically from a -- basically zero starting point in the first quarter, a lot of your guidance you\u2019re talking kind of hovers around high single to low double. Don\u2019t you need solidly double-digits to drag the average up to 6% for the year? Eric Green : Yes we do, Dave. That\u2019s we\u2019re looking at is -- if you look at through the pacing of the quarter, it\u2019s building up towards that, but its back half of 2018. It's going to be much stronger than we had in the first half and its little bit of a comp issue too. We sort of thinking about the back half of last year. David Windley : Yes, okay. And then maybe one last one, then I will yield to others. On the qualitative side, I was thinking about -- and you have had this impact to lead times and inventory we talked for several quarters about how -- there were bottlenecks that you addressed, but during the bottlenecks clients over brought and built inventory and then once you address them there's kind of a tough comp and as they\u2019re lapping those activities. And I think those are more generic biased, but we've also kind of use those same types of descriptions in Biologics, and I think qualitatively the issues are different, right? Because in Biologics it sounds like your issues are clients launching product or not is that delayed, do you have visibility on that? And, I guess, help me to understand am I right that kind of the nature of the two issues is different such that like our confidence that we're going to lap the issues in Biologics is different and maybe not as high as the simple lapping of the generic issue? Eric Green : Yes, that is a very good observation. That\u2019s a good -- so when we think about the generics, you are right. A lot of the bottlenecks that occurred at year and half, two years ago was around our high-value product portfolio and conversion of generics customers to that part of our portfolio. And because of the fact that we weren't able to produce the lead times escalated significantly, I would say we have lapped that clearly. And in the generics space we're actually delivering, add new record cycle times that is faster than anybody in the industry today. So when you think about the Biologics you're absolutely correct when you said there is -- it's a little different than generics. It's still the high-value product portfolio, but there is a large component of that is build up for launches and then the drug acceptance into the marketplace. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. I can assure you what we\u2019ve learned with the generic customers versus our top customers where we put a -- supply chains together, we\u2019re now mapping out demand curves required for the largest launches. It gives us better anticipation, not just in the Generics, but now in the Biologics space. So there's some of that confidence that we\u2019re seeing in the Biologics, yes, the cycle times are much less. You don\u2019t need to order as much in advance but the larger portion of that is really around drug launches, the cyclicality of that. David Windley : All right. As promised, I will step out. Thanks. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Dave. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Eric Green : Good morning, Larry. Larry Solow : A follow-up on the backlog question. You guys have done a great job obviously reducing lead times. And historically backlog was sort of somewhat of an indicator of future growth with some nuances obviously especially more lately. There's a fact that you're -- you were basically flat year-over-year. Does your forecast entail more -- even more and greater customer conversations and -- in other words, how do you sort of see yourself growing eventually at low double-digit this year when your backlog is kind of flattish? And then, the second question would be not that you have more capacity, have discussion sort of opened up around sort of changing some customer -- some of the existing products, older products getting more into the HVP, high-value stuff on that -- on those end? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, those are good questions. Thank you. So the first one, talk about backlog. You\u2019re absolutely correct. What you see -- what we see today is a different profile of the backlog and what I mean by that is historically we would have pretty much visibility, it's pretty even dispersed over the next three to four quarters. What we\u2019re seeing now, even though its flat, higher proportion of that backlog number is more near-term. I.e., if I look at today with Q2 and Q3, and it goes to the fact that the cycle times are less -- customer is less prone to put orders in long-term. It doesn't mean that they\u2019re looking at [indiscernible] of sources. We are on those molecules. We are the supplier of choice for their products that they launch. It's just we are able to perform in a much higher level than we had in the past. And that is due to lean initiatives, that\u2019s due to capacity expansion that we have in place today that gives us that platform. So I\u2019m confident we sort of thinking about what the backlog is more near-term than long-term. That\u2019s the changing dynamics. The capacity conversation, you're right. Larry, we are in active conversations with our customers moving them from standard products to high-value products. And while some customers are taking a platform approach and we\u2019re moving more of their molecules towards that. Some are looking at from one at a time. We are adding -- when you think about Waterford as an example, while we are -- we\u2019ve the facility been validated by our customers where we think commercial ramp up, we are continuing to add new technologies like RU -- Westar RU in Waterford. We\u2019ve a more complete solution to drive the quality. So that -- these are the initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place to convert our customers from standard to high-value products. Larry Solow : Okay. Just a question in terms of cadence of growth, you can grow after the year. I know you guys got it quarterly, but it sounds like maybe a little bit improvement in Q2, but most of the sequential improvement will really occur in three and then into four, is that sort of good assessment? Eric Green : Yes, Larry. I think you will find consistent growth around the generics. Pharma as I mentioned would be more consistent from a revenue perspective, but on a comp perspective you will see it accelerate as a percentage, because the comp is less than 2017 and Biologics we will see a continued acceleration throughout the year. Larry Solow : Okay, great. Thanks. Eric Green : Thank you, Larry. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Dana Flanders with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Dana Flanders : Hi. Thank you very much for the questions. I guess my first one and just following up on just the cadence throughout the year. Can you just talk a little bit about just the gross and operating margin progression that we should expect? I mean, will that generally follow revenue growth or is there any lumpiness that that we should be thinking about in terms of just margin improvement throughout the year? Bill Federici : Yes, Dana. Thank you. Yes, it will be more progressive as the year goes. It was as we said a very tough comp in the first quarter. As we go through the year with both high-value product expansion and the growth in sales expansion as we talked about, we believe that that margins will get better as the year progresses. So, yes, definitely back half ended and progressing as the year goes. Dana Flanders : Okay, great. Bill Federici : That\u2019s both for gross margin and for operating margin. Dana Flanders : Okay, great. And just my second quick follow-up, just on the bigger picture on competition, I believe a few of your larger competitors have announced investment in expanding capacity. Just how are you thinking about the supply demand equilibrium in the medium-term across standard products, across high-value products and just, I guess, the potential for competition on new business? Thank you. Eric Green : Yes. Dana, we are aware of our competition. We are continuously investing in certain parts of the business. What we are looking at again just putting into perspective the volumes that we produced today, lower $40 billion -- components a year. And to get a site up and running you\u2019re seeing this with us on the Waterford when we started that project in 2014, right. And so here we are talking about customers just validated the lines and we\u2019re starting to -- flip into commercial revenues for 2018. Our process is pretty consistent to other companies that would have to -- as the building and validation doesn't really change. Said that, we are aware that they\u2019re building capacity. We are having active discussions to our customers that continue to move up the high-value product curve so that as you start thinking about differentiation it really is around the quality. It's around availability of the service which we believe that we just in the last 12 to 18 months as significantly raise the bar. So we're not complacent. We understand the situation, but we do believe that we will continue to be in a very favorable position because of those levers. Dana Flanders : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. When is Waterford coming online? Eric Green : Yes, Paul, we have -- right now we\u2019re validating product with customers. They are actually -- we\u2019ve sampled. We are working through the changes that will occur from manufacture in other locations to our Waterford facility on existing products, but also new products. There's obviously a validation process. In Q3, we're looking at revenues, commercial revenues and that will be the -- really the official -- launch and grow as we proceed throughout the quarters. We got -- I have to tell you I\u2019ve been there a few times. The site is really, really well-positioned. Our customers are very complementary of what we've done not just to replicate current processes, but to really move them into the next generation. So I think that there's a lot of interest and we\u2019ve a lot of visitors on-site for future business. So, Q3 and forward. Paul Knight : And then the burn you\u2019re -- how -- what is this burning up on SG&A for the interim here for quarter? Eric Green : Okay. Go on. Bill Federici : So, Paul, it really impacts more cost. The under absorbed overhead was $3.6 million in the quarter. We will see a similar amount in the second quarter, but as you remember we discussed last year, we started depreciating the plant in the second quarter. So you will start to see that that under absorbed overhead as its comparable to last year. We will start to update and as we start to get from the commercial activities in Q3 and beyond, that number, the unabsorbed overhead will lessen as we go through the year. Paul Knight : And then lastly CapEx you're saying down this year below 150, what's it look like after this year? Eric Green : Yes, Paul, that\u2019s -- we\u2019re -- I\u2019ve to tell you, one of the changes we made about a year and half ago is -- and we\u2019ve always thought about our operations globally, but we really formalized the global operations and we have 28 manufacturing sites. And by formalizing the global approach we are able to allocate our resources, I would say probably more effectively on where we want to invest in centers of excellence and also we look at capacity, we built at Kinston, we have Waterford on the ground. We\u2019ve expanded in Dublin. We have bricks-and-mortar. And so this year we're looking at below 150. We believe going forward we will be hovering around that corridor and as a percentage of sales we will continue to drop. Right now just to put into two dimension, right now we\u2019re looking at about $50 million to $60 million of our CapEx is around maintenance. And if you want to maintain a high level of quality and productivity of our facility, that\u2019s the investments we have to make. We are putting about [Indiscernible] into IT. It's a combination of some maintenance, but also future growth and the balance is really around new products, new innovations and new HVP portfolios that are coming into the market. That\u2019s how you would look at the split. Paul Knight : Okay. Thanks. Eric Green : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Drew Jones with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Drew Jones : Thanks, guys. Looking at the core proprietary product revenue, down about 2% year-over-year, is it -- can you parse out how much of that was volume versus how much was mix? And is it safe to assume that the volumes are going to rebound in the back half of the year? I know you talked a lot about HVP being a key driver from here, but just want to get a feel for the volumes bounce and back other than just easier comps coming up? Bill Federici : Yes. We do obviously believe that the lines will continue to grow from all things that Eric described earlier. We don't parse out volume and mix other than where we talked about high-value products was also down in the quarter. But as Eric commented, we believe for the full-year we will see high single to low double-digit growth of high-value products. So therefore as you can assume we\u2019re going to continue to accelerate not only volume wise, but also mix wise. And remember our construct is only -- it's about 1% price, 2% to 3% market volume, and then the rest is mix. So while we didn't see a whole lot of growth in the first quarter, Eric mentioned we don't see any lost business and we\u2019re going to continue to grow this business in the way that we believe that construct make sense for us. So more growth coming in the back half of the year obviously, but both volume mix and a little bit of price. Drew Jones : Perfect. And then on the contract manufacturing side, you talked about losing the consumer, customer filling that with a healthcare line. What\u2019s your line of sight for when that\u2019s going to stop being a drag on margins? Eric Green : Well, that\u2019s rule quickly. The consumer business that we lost and they brought in house themselves, that is for the -- will be the full-year of 2018. So we ended that relationship at the end of '17 -- literally at the end of '17 and that will have an impact -- somewhat even impact throughout '18. I have to say though that we are talking about high single-digit performance even with that particular losses is pretty impressive because of the focus -- strategic focus around the healthcare space that\u2019s driving that performance. Bill do you want to \u2026? Bill Federici : Yes, just one extra thought on there. There's two components to the piece that impacted Q1. The one is the -- obviously the margin on the products sold. But then there's the under absorbed overhead that it leaves in its place when you take the product out. As part of the restructuring plan that we talked about, we\u2019re going to be combining those two contract manufacturing facilities in the U.S into one and so -- and that will happen in latter part of 2018, the second half. And therefore you'll see that under absorbed overhead piece of that issue go away. So less of a drag in the back half of the year. But as Eric said the strong growth in healthcare is definitely a net positive for that business going forward. Drew Jones : Thanks, guys. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derik DeBruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik DeBruin : Hi. Good morning. Eric Green : Hi, Derik. Derik DeBruin : Hi. Bill, just a question, I mean, when you sort of look at second quarter were exchange rates, what\u2019s sort of embedded in your model for FX on 2Q and then also for the balance of the year. I mean 7% was well above -- and Q1 was well above what we had modeled. Eric Green : Yes. Yes, so you\u2019re right. Q1 was \u20ac1.23 per dollar, our dollar per euro for the first quarter. The rest of the year we've scheduled in at \u20ac1.20. Even though the spot rate today is \u20ac1.22, we took a conservative stance on the FX growth. So if you remember the paradigm it is a $0.01 change in the ratio for the full-year with yield about a penny of EPS. So our previous guidance had been at the -- at \u20ac1.20, we left it there for now. There is some benefit in the first quarter and we're being conservative by just saying that we will be at \u20ac1.20 for the rest the year. So in the second quarter using the \u20ac1.20 you should expect about 0.04 of EPS expansion versus the prior year. Derik DeBruin : Okay. And so that was about the same rate than in the first quarter about $0.04 benefit? Bill Federici : It is -- no, it's higher than -- a little higher than that Derik because we\u2019ve \u20ac1.23 not $1.20. So in the first quarter \u2026 Derik DeBruin : Got you. Bill Federici : \u2026 it was $0.07. Derik DeBruin : $0.07 EPS -- FX, got you. Bill Federici : Yes. Derik DeBruin : And I\u2019m just sort of curious on -- basically your -- you\u2019ve got those very clean balance sheet and sort of like how are you guys thinking about utilizing that going forward? I mean, is there more indication to sort of lever up just a touch to maybe even more aggressive on buybacks. I\u2019m just curious in terms of what I mean you don\u2019t -- it doesn\u2019t sound like you -- I mean, you don\u2019t really need to acquire any things sort of given the growth profile of the company, I\u2019m just wondering what -- what's sort of your plan is on the balance sheet? Eric Green : Yes, Derik, I would like to talk about a couple aspects of that, use of cash. Number one is as you know we want to continue to fuel the high-value product portfolio with internal organic investments. But in addition to that is continuously looking at potential bolt-on technologies or broaden the product portfolio. And I would argue in the last 2.5 years, my tenure here we\u2019ve been not very inquisitive in that space. But I think we have a good position, a good line of sight where our customers are asking us to look at part of as broaden the portfolio and we will take that into consideration as we move forward. But we, obviously, are giving the dividends, we are doing share buyback this year. And the Board authorized about [indiscernible] shares really to keep the share count somewhat neutral for the balance of the year. But that\u2019s generally how we look at use of cash today and we are looking at that on a regular basis. We don't see that static. The dynamics do change and there's more opportunities in lever or the other to make sure we balance between our customers and our shareholders, we will do that. Derik DeBruin : Great. And just one final thing, I just noticed on the -- on slide 4, you called out some reclassification, some sales in your Pharma segment. Can you sort of talk about what that is? And I think it had sort of the impact of maybe making the 2Q comp a little bit tougher? Bill Federici : It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with 2Q comp, but it is as you suggest, Derik, we\u2019ve looked at the way that we record those sales by the market units and there needs to be tweaking from time-to-time based on customers order, things in the Biologics space, the Pharma space and the generics space, so it is difficult to parse it out between the various market units. We\u2019ve gone through and we\u2019ve periodically go through and look at it. These are very, very small changes, they're not significant. In fact, for the full-year its less than 1 percentage point. So we just want to be absolutely transparent, but really that was very, very small. Derik DeBruin : So it's just a matter of just like how your customers are sort of being defined or what it is. It's just that -- I mean, in that sense, that\u2019s how you\u2019re looking at it? Bill Federici : Yes, it's just how -- not how we define them. So, if we have a customer that we sell both Bio, Pharma, and Generics, all three of them into which we do have customers that are that way, parsing it out between those three buckets is not a perfect science and we look at it periodically and make sure that we're getting it right. And again just to reiterate there is no change in the overall portfolio of proprietary products. None of these changes are outside of that. It's all within those three buckets. Derik DeBruin : Great. Thank you. Bill Federici : Thank you, Derik. Eric Green : Thank you, Derik. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. So now it is my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations for some closing comments or remarks. Sir?

I now turn the call over to West\u2019s CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we start the review of our financial results, I am pleased to welcome to the call our newest member of the team, Bernard Birkett. Bernard joined us as CFO in late June. And you will hear more from him later today. Our outgoing CFO, Bill Federici, is actively working with Bernard in this transition period. And I want to take a moment to thank him. As many of you know, Bill has been a critical contributor to West and our Company\u2019s success over the past 15 years. He\u2019s also been a tremendous mentor and leader for his team as well as a great friend and colleague to his peers and to me. We thank him for his service, and we wish Bill and his family all the best as they embark on the next chapter of their lives, following his retirement from West. Turning now to the financial results. This morning we reported our second quarter performance. We have solid sales growth in our Proprietary Products segment led by double-digit growth in our high value products. We also saw a strong sales growth in our contract manufacturing segment. Because of the strong topline performance, we start consolidated growth in operating margin expansion in the quarter. In addition to adjusted EPS growth of 25% year-over-year excluding stock option tax benefits. With the first half of the year in the books, we are reaffirming our overall 2018 sales and adjusted EPS guidance. As Bernard will review in his comments, you will see that his guidance assumes a lower euro exchange rate for the second half of 2018 than previously reported. In Slide 4 shown our organic sales performance by quarter across both segments of our business. In the second quarter, we had organic sales growth of 9%. The highest level in the past seven quarters. The Proprietary Products segment grew organically 7% over the prior year, with growing coming from all three market units and all geographies. Looking at our individual proprietary market units, let\u2019s start with Biologics. As we expected and outlined last year, we saw return to positive organic sales growth in Q2. Our customers in this area continue to turn to us for our high value products to contain and deliver their sensitive Biologics. A few of our large customers are still affected by prior prelaunch activities and inventory management, primarily around self-injection systems. But everything we hear from our customers leaves us to believe that we will see continued improvement in the growth rate for the Biologics market unit for the full year. Our Generics market unit had double-digit organic sales growth this quarter, fueled by a stronger high-value product sales, led by Westar RU, SelfDose and Envision products. As we look at the second half of the year, the comps starts to normalize, and we expect Generics to grow in the mid to high-single digits for the full year. Our Pharma market unit returned to positive growth after three consecutive quarters of decline. Consistent with the other market units, we experienced strong high value product growth. We believe our Pharma customers are beginning to normalize their order patterns, following the execution of inventory management programs. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect growth to accelerate as we face more favorable comps from last year. We also believe the additional investments we made in Puerto Rico to expand our capacity for administration systems will lead this market unit to grow in the mid-single digits for the full year. Turning to Contract Manufacturing. This segment have strong sales growth with 17% organic growth. Healthcare customers represent 88% of the contract manufacturing sales, and sales to these customers has strong double-digit gains in the quarter. We are pleased with the success we had in this area of our business. However, in response to our customers increasing demand requirements, we are experiencing some growing pains in the form of labor and operational cost that have impact to the margin this quarter. Bernard will cover the detail around this and how we see this recovering. As we look to the rest of the year for Contract Manufacturing, we expect full year sales growth to be in the high-single digits, even in face of a very tough comp in Q4. As a reminder, Q4 2017 had a significant amount of tooling sales as generated the strong recurring sales growth we are now seeing in 2018. We now move to Slide 5. We are pleased to announce that several of our newly launched products received industry recognition this quarter, and we introduced another new product category, Westar Select, adding to our already strong high value product portfolio. Our AccelTRA Component Program was recognized with the 2018 India Packaging Award in the category of packaging design and injectables. AccelTRA was designed for customers like those in our Generics market unit, they are demanding high-quality components, reliable supply and speed to market. I am pleased on how this program is resonating with our Generics customers. In June, the company received a Medical Design Excellence Award for drug delivery in combination products for our SelfDose, patient-controlled injector. The honor was presented to West and our customer Accord Healthcare Limited, who launched their Methofill SELF INJECT product in the UK and Ireland this year, using our SelfDose injector technology. And last week, we announced the launch of a brand-new product line Westar Select. In addition to a tighter particular specification, this product line will be made available through our an optimized global manufacturing network to ensure continued supply, while helping to streamline our customers regulatory submissions. These products remained stronger by the deep technical team that stands behind them, and serves as a valuable resource to our customers. On Slide 6, we have outlined examples of technical customer engagement in support of our customers and our own scientific advancements. These milestones demonstrates a continued momentum we are seeing as we work to further position our company as these scientific destination for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. I think it\u2019s fair to say that our customers see us as a leader in this space. We have worked hard to achieve this recognition and plan to continue to invest and expand our capabilities in this area of our business. On Slide 7, we present some highlights from the accomplishments of our global operations team in the quarter. Last week, we officially opened our Waterford, Ireland facility. Waterford is designed to be a global center of excellence for West\u2019s advanced manufacturing network. Recently, the site successfully completed its ISO audits, and now holds and maintains active drug massive files with the FDA and Health Canada. Achieving these milestones means we are now able to supply commercial products, manufactured under CGMP with the appropriate regulatory documentation to support our customers. We anticipate making commercial deliveries in both insulin sheeting and HVP product later this year. We are also in the process of launching new capacity for our proprietary administration systems at our site in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a great example of the benefit of managing a worldwide network, a manufacturing plant through a consolidated comprehensive system, we are now calling One West. This business system provides a framework for continuous improvement in safety, quality, service and cost, while driving lien principals consistently across our global operations. We are also driving more efficiencies and better utilizing capacity across our global network, while we manage the growth of the business. This is evidenced in the reduction of CapEx spending for the new infrastructure. As noted in today\u2019s release, we are reducing our CapEx guidance for the year to $120 million to $130 million compared to the prior guidance of less than $150 million. We also continued to be on track with the restructuring plans, which we detailed in our last call. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Burkett, who will provide more color on our financial performance and to provide details on our long-term outlook. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the details of our Q2 performance, I want to first say how happy I am to be a part of West. With more than 23 years of experience working in med tech, working in healthcare has always been a passion for me. So I\u2019m excited to be part of the company that plays such an important role in helping to improve patient lives. West is well positioned for future growth and I am looking forward to being a part of that journey. I am grateful for Bill Federici\u2019s leadership to date and look forward to continuing the legacy of strong financial management that West is known for. So let\u2019s get to the numbers. In continuing to deliver on the objectives we have set, we are pleased to report for the second quarter, reported net sales of $447.5 million, representing strong top line organic growth of 9% on a constant currency basis; expansion in gross margin to 31.8% versus 31.4% in Q2 of 2017, which represents a 40 basis points improvement, and adjusted EPS of $0.70 as compared to $0.66 last year. Excluding the impact of stock option exercise tax benefits, adjusted EPS grew by 25%. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures are described in Slide 14 to 18. Taking a deeper dive into our sales performance, we have seen sales growth in each of our business segments and market units. Slide 9 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. Proprietary Product sales increased 7%, price increases accounted for 1.7% of the sales increase, our high value product sales increased by 11.7%. The generics market unit business saw double-digit sales growth in the current quarter as expected. Pharma market unit sales growth was in the high single digits. And sales to biologic customer showed low single-digit growth over the prior-year quarter. Our high value products represented almost 60% of Q2 2018 sales compared to 57% of Q2 2017 sales. For the full year 2018, we expect high single-digit sales growth in high value products. Contract-Manufactured Product net sales increased by 17%. New product launches in late 2017, particularly in our Dublin facility in support of diagnostic and delivery systems for treatment of diabetes, are driving much of the increase in sales. We expect high single-digit sales growth in contract manufacturing for the full year 2018. Let\u2019s turn to margin performance and improvements. As provided on Slide 10, our consolidated gross profit margin for Q2 2018 was 31.8% versus 31.4% margin we achieved in the second quarter of 2017. Proprietary Products second quarter gross margin of 37.2% was 180 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2017. The increase in gross margin is due to the favorable mix of products sold, pricing and product \u2013 production efficiencies coming from One West initiative, which more than offsets $4 million of overhead cost increases in Waterford, in preparation for the initial production activities in the second half of the year. Contract-Manufactured Product second quarter gross margin of 13.1%, decreased by 370 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. Three items impacted margin. Unabsorbed overhead from one of our facilities in the first half of the year. This facility is now back to normal production levels. Previously announced plans consolidation activities and startup costs associated with launching new programs and increased sales of products with higher purchase material content. We are confident that contract manufacturing margins will improve throughout the second half of 2018, as we complete our restructuring activities, continue to improve our efficiency and utilization levels, which are all part of our One West initiative program and deliver on the new customer programs. As reflected on Slide 11, Q2 2018 consolidated SG&A expense increased by $8.7 million versus the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of sales, second quarter 2018 SG&A expense was 15.6% versus 15.4% in the second quarter of 2017. Foreign exchange increased SG&A by $1.3 million. Higher incentive compensation cost account for approximately half of the remaining SG&A increase. Excluding these items, SG&A grew by approximately 6.8%. For the second half of the year, we are confident in forecasting mid-single-digit growth in SG&A. Slide 12 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $127 million for the first half of 2018, an increase of $21 million compared to the first half of 2017, primarily reflecting the $20 million voluntary pension contribution made in the prior year. Our year-to-date capital spending is $48.2 million, $18.8 million lower than a year ago, as we have completed our major construction projects in Ireland. We forecast CapEx spend to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million in 2018. Approximately half of our planned capital spending is dedicated to advanced manufacturing growth and innovation initiatives, with the remainder our normal maintenance, replacement and information system. Moving onto some balance sheet takeaways. Slide 12 shows our cash balance at June 30 of $225 million, was $10 million less than our December 2017 balance. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we purchased 800,000 shares of our common stock under our board authorized share buyback plan at a cost of $70.8 million or an average price of $88.51 per share. The completion of our share buyback plan and decreased capital spending projections should result in improved free cash flow in the second half of 2018. Debt at June 30, 2018 of $196 million is roughly the same level as at year-end and on a net debt to total invested capital ratio basis, we are completely delevered. Working capital of $479 million at June 30 was $15 million higher than at year-end. Most of the increases in receivables related to the growth in our business and an increase in our day sales outstanding metrics, partially due to the impacts of the new revenue recognition accounting rules. So turning to guidance. On Slide 13, we are reaffirming our full year 2018 sales and EPS guidance range. Even with the impact of lower U.S. dollar per euro exchange rates, which we are forecasting. We anticipate second half gross margin improvements in both our proprietary and contract manufacturing segments, due to sales mix, production efficiencies and plant utilization. Our projections now anticipate a euro exchange spot rate of $1.15 per Euro for the remainder of 2018. Our previous guidance was based on an exchange rate of $1.20 per Euro. Our forecast anticipates $9 million or $0.12 per share with the tax benefits from stock compensation for the full year. We expect our 2018 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%, excluding the impact of the tax benefit from option exercises. To summarize the key takeaways for the quarter. We saw solid sales performance across all segments of our business, overall gross margin improvement, EPS growth and a reduction in our CapEx forecast for the year. Guidance is maintained and we are on track to deliver on our goals and objectives for the year. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. And once again, welcome to West. It\u2019s great to have you on the team. As we look to the remainder of 2018, we believe our long-term growth trajectory remained strong. Through the execution of our market led strategy, we are making good progress against our goals and objectives for the year. We are growing proprietary and contract manufacturing sales by engaging our customers within the generics, biologics and pharma markets. We are developing and introducing new high-quality products and services to address unmet customer needs. And we are leveraging our global operations to operate more efficiently and effectively. These efforts are returning value to our customers and to our shareholders. Our continued progress makes us confident in our growth targets for the short and long-term, and we look forward to successful second half of 2018. Sarah, we are ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and welcome to Bernard. I wanted to first, I guess, focus on the revenue number on your nice acceleration there. Was \u2013 I think one of the factors that you are expecting to impact the second half was \u2013 the supply out of Puerto Rico and the contribution to Vial2Bag. And I was wondering if that is still basically proceeding on plan? Or if perhaps there were some contribution to 2Q earlier than expected? And similarly, were there other \u2013 I\u2019ll call it accelerations in other high value products that help 2Q a little more than you might have expected and we should take into account for our second half thoughts? Thanks. Bernard Birkett : Yes. David good morning, and thank you for the question. In regards to the administration systems, specifically around Vial2Bag, we\u2019re still on target with our capacity expansion for the second half of this year, which you rightly noted we\u2019ll have a positive impact on our Pharma unit for the second half. What we experienced in Q2, specifically in the Pharma unit, is more around this effort around converting customers to high value products, specifically, in our elastomer \u2013 with our elastomers. And we talked about in past calls, where we have a few customers that are making that conversion from standard to high value products. And it does take time. It\u2019s a journey. But we\u2019re seeing good progress, good traction, and it\u2019s a little bit stronger than we anticipated in Q2. David Windley : Okay, very interesting. So given that journey that conversion once started, I would think would have a pretty steady positive influence on high value product sales. Is that fair? Bernard Birkett : It does in the sense David that, as they convert from standard to high value products, the new basis with the HVPs, and we\u2019ll continue to convert more up to the high value products. But I\u2019ll be in the base and continue to have a positive growth for the balance of the year for Pharma. David Windley : If I could just ask one more on the cost side, you have a couple of things, the labor and other cost factors that you called out in Contract Manufacturing and the Waterford opening and ramp there. Are those things that that begin to alleviate very quickly? Or essentially how long does it take you to scale to alleviate the labor issues and scale into the Waterford plan? Thanks. Eric Green : Yes, David, good question. Let me take into two parts, if you don\u2019t mind. One is let\u2019s talk about the gross margins. So we look at, we have two business of the Proprietary and Contracts. Obviously, Proprietary, we had higher gross margin in that particular business about 180 basis points expansion. It\u2019s inclusive of about 120 basis point headwind of Waterford. And that really is driven by the high value products. So as we talked about is that the power and \u2013 of the high value products, really does drive margin expansion as we grow that business near double-digits. In the contract manufacture specifically, you absolutely right, we had the headwinds in the quarter of due to labor and operational startup. And we believe that anticipating very quickly. And the reason for that is because specifically towards ramping up in two particular areas, continuous glucose monitoring devices that we manufacture out of Arizona and out of Dublin. The demand from our customers is ramping little faster than we anticipated. And the second area is around injection device for the diabetes market, we\u2019ve also seen very nice expansion there. If you look at the growth of those two particular areas, that\u2019s one of the major drivers. We have 17% topline growth and Contract Manufacturing expects strong second half for this year. So we believe and as Bernard mentioned in his discussion, the gross margin for the Contract Manufacturing will become more in line in the second half of this year and you should start to see the improvement immediately in this quarter. David Windley : Super, thank you. Eric Green : Yes. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hi [indiscernible] congratulations on winning West. Bernard Birkett : Thank you. Paul Knight : And the \u2013 on Proprietary Products, with your revenue recognition that you\u2019re doing there now, what was the impact on the quarter in terms of revenue growth and margin? Eric Green : Yes. I believe it was immaterial effect on the numbers in the second quarter. Bernard Birkett : Paul, most of the revenue recognition challenges that we had year-to-date has been really run our Contract Manufacturing business. But the impact of revenue recognition for the quarter is really minimal for our business. Paul Knight : Okay, got it. And then on high value add products Eric, is that growth rate change or has that been lower to little bit in your view? Eric Green : No. The high value product growth that we\u2019re experiencing the double-digit for Q2, we strongly believe that consistently that business over a period of time should be growing high single or double. So we believe its now in the corridor that we anticipate, not just for about this year, but going into 2019 and beyond. Just to remind ourselves on this that the volume of units for high value products still less than 20% of our total volumes that we produce annually. So we do believe that the growth trajectory for HVP still has some ways to go. Paul Knight : And then also on the Ireland facility, are you going to have revenue in the third quarter? Or when do you expect a meaningful amount of revenue out of Waterford? Eric Green : I can \u2013 I\u2019m pleased to tell you, we will have some revenue in Q3, however. Obviously, we need to do a ramp-up both for insulin sheeting and HVP final product \u2013 finishing of the final product out of that facility. So there will be some revenue. It won\u2019t take \u2013 it won\u2019t absorb that $4 million headwind that we had in Q2, 100%. We do believe this is going to take some time. We do have those orders in hand. We are processing them as we speak. And we\u2019ll ramp up gradually over the next several quarters. Paul Knight : And then, I\u2019m sorry for so many questions, but the last one is, any color on Crystal Zenith, how is the product update looking there for you Eric? Eric Green : Yes. Actually it\u2019s \u2013 we are actually pleased with the progress, and the reason for that is in the first quarter, we had participated with two customers that were approved of final product into the marketplace. The interest level continues to rise. We are seeing various from early stages to Phase I, II and III, all the way up to the recent drug filings for approval as I mentioned to in Q1. And we do have line of sight of another product was submitted for approval. So we are filling positive of Crystal Zenith, we start to thinking about the opportunities in that particular space, they\u2019re still very pronounced especially in the Biologics area. But we are also starting to get interest in the areas of pharmaceutical. The Pharma market was small molecules. So it\u2019s a slow journey, but we are pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in the most recent years. That particular part of the business grew well in the double digits, but its from a small baseball, but expectations are still on track. Paul Knight : Okay, thank you. Eric Green : Thanks. Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dana Flanders with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Dana Flanders : Hi, thank you very much for the questions and congratulations on the quarter. My first one here, can you just elaborate a little bit on the strengths in the CMO business? You saw this quarter and I know in the press release and you mentioned on the call, some benefits from just timing of tooling orders as well as some recent competitive takeaways. Can you just touch on that, how much of the performance this quarter was driven by that? And what you should expect for the second half of the year? Eric Green : Yes, Dana, good morning and thanks for the question. We look at the Contract Manufacturing business. Just to give you a little dimension of that we mentioned about 88% or plus 90% of the business is healthcare. We\u2019ve been making that transition away from consumer products and mostly focused around obviously, the healthcare, including diagnostics markets. And we are having some really good success. We believe that particular market is growing, let\u2019s call it, mid-single digit. That\u2019s our expectations. But we\u2019re growing faster than that and it\u2019s because of what you indicated, as we are having some competitive takeovers and winning new contracts. The two areas of that 90% \u2013 roughly 90%% of the business, above a little bit less than \u2013 about a half of it is really going into our Biologics customers. And give you an example, we are having ramp up I mean, injection device for the diabetes markets for one of our customers. And fortunately not just the Contract Manufacturing of the device, but we also participate with the NOVACHOICE plunger, which is a high value product for us in that particular that unit. The other part of the growth that we are seeing \u2013 that we saw in Q2, really is a continuous glucose monitoring devices, and again, both from Arizona and Dublin. Our production we have to continue to ramp up or had been asked to produce more volume, because the demand is there. And that\u2019s very exciting. As we look forward Dana, we\u2019re looking at areas of adding new capabilities around cold chain storage, drug handling. This is also attracting new customers and new projects. So I believe some of the volatility we are going to have. On a positive side, we\u2019ll be to the new offerings that we\u2019re going to be offering in the marketplace. Dana Flanders : Okay, perfect. That\u2019s incredibly helpful. And maybe just my second question, on Generics, again, another very nice quarter out of you guys actually accelerating from Q1. Can you just elaborate on the strength there? I mean, is that still Asia Pac? And maybe talk a little bit about kind of the high value product growth you\u2019re seeing in Generics? What products, what customers and how you think about just the balance of that as we get into the second half? Thank you. Eric Green : Yes. Thank you, Dana. It\u2019s really \u2013 I\u2019m really pleased with the Generics team. I mean, obviously, if you look back to 2017, we had some challenges. And I truly believe based on interactions with customers, that was driven, primarily due to our inability to have shorter lead times for our customers in 2016. So we had a tremendous volume growth in 2016, 2017 customers gain confidence of our lead times are now well below \u2013 if you talk about 8 or 10 weeks versus 20 to 30 weeks. And that\u2019s significant. We\u2019re getting accolades from our customers now that\u2019s changing the order patterns. So if you look at the growth we are seeing now, we think we have normalized when it comes to that inventory management cycle. We are seeing growth across all customer types large, midsize and small. Let\u2019s take this part a little better. One is in Asia. That business continue to grow very fast, while in the double digits that we saw in Q1. We\u2019re also seeing high value products growth in Generics continued to ramp up, probably a little bit faster we anticipated, that\u2019s a good sign the program like AccelTRA, and our Westar RU and Envision is gaining traction in that particular space. So it\u2019s across multiple customer segments, it\u2019s not just one or two customers which I am pleased about. And it is across all geographies, and it\u2019s really hitting more of our high value products and the standard products. Dana Flanders : Great, thank you. Eric Green : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Thank you. Good morning. Just \u2013 first half I would just like to congratulate Bill. I am not sure if he\u2019s on the call, but his retirement and thank him for the help through the years, and certainly wish him the best of luck, and of course, also welcome Bernard to the team and I look forward to working with you. Eric Green : Great. I know Bill is listening to you. So that\u2019s great. Larry Solow : Excellent, excellent. You mentioned just on the \u2013 just a few global questions, most of my questions have answered, but on the high value products sort of sustainable high-single, low-double digit growth, is it historically or up until today, it\u2019s been mostly driven by \u2013 on newly approved drugs. Are you seeing more? Or do you expect more sort of an uptick on conversion to some of the order legacy products in customer\u2019s pipelines? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, this \u2013 you\u2019re right in regards to new product pipeline, particularly in all three market units. We\u2019re focused on converting our customers and having focused on high value products as they go through the process for approval. But we\u2019re actually seeing good traction and conversion from standard to high value products. And in addition to that we are seeing, I don\u2019t use the word, upgrades to Westar and Envision upgrades than from the standard products. So it\u2019s not just moving to the high value products, we\u2019re also seeing our customers move up the value curve, all the way up to NovaPure, and that is one of the elements that you see with that growth. Again, every time we are able to take our customer in the journey towards the ultimately the NovaPure offering, not just the ASP increased, but it\u2019s also the margins increased associated to that. So it\u2019s a combination of both, Larry. Larry Solow : Right. And sticking sort of with the product offering. Can you maybe just give us a little more color on the new Westar Select sort of the incremental benefit it provides? I know you mentioned it has, I guess, a tighter particulate specification. But is that sort of the incremental benefit? And I guess, sort of expected cadence of growth in benefit? I imagine, it will be a slow incremental growth constant overtime like many of your other products. Eric Green : Yes. That\u2019s a good question, because the thesis behind this product portfolio is starting to look at our operations form over a process perspective than the site specifics. So one of the conversations we had historically is how do we start offering one DMF or Drug Master File for regulatory approval that crosses multiple sites. And you can imagine the benefit our customers, but also for us from an operation perspective that we can start level loading our operations. This is a journey, and it\u2019s going to take some time to convert more customers towards that, but that was really one of the fundamental thesis around the state of the art facility built in Waterford. So you\u2019re going to have customers looking at Kinston, Waterford and Singapore, and these approvals are made on process and not site-specific, which is a great opportunity. We also took the opportunity to improve on the formulation and the processes we put in place around the product to really drive the tighter tolerance around specifications. And you can imagine that resonates very well with our customers. So it is a journey. It\u2019s going to take some time to adopt customers into the Westar Select, but this is a change that customers have been asking for a while, and now we have the capabilities of doing it. Larry Solow : Okay, great. And just lastly on the CapEx number, you \u2013 looks like you lowered numbers by $20 million to $30 million. Just a few questions around that, obviously, it sounds like it\u2019s a positive thing and sort of relates to the successful managing of the infrastructure. A couple of questions, is this sort of sustainable number as we look out of the next few years? You would have any visibility on that? And is this \u2013 I assume, this will sort of should help it\u2019s probably already helping your operating margin. And is it sort of tied into the whole ongoing restructuring initiative, where I think you said, you expect $8 million to $13 million savings by the end of next year. Eric Green : Yes. So when we look at the capital expenditures, in the last several years, we had some significant spend on infrastructure. And while we feel really confident that we\u2019re going to be able to leverage these new assets, i.e., the expansion in Kinston, the new facility in Waterford, we believe fundamentally with the new global operations approach that we can leverage our assets more effectively. We did reduce our guidance for this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to assess because the traction has been very positive for the last few quarters. And will be able to be little bit more clear on our expectations going forward for the next few years probably later this year. But from my expectations is, we need to drive higher utilization of our existing assets to improve upon not just our margins, but our ROIC and other key metrics that is a clear indicator of the performance of the company. Larry Solow : Excellent, great. Thanks, Eric, appreciate it. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik DeBruin : Hi, good morning and welcome Bernard. Bernard Birkett : Thank you. Derik DeBruin : I\u2019m a better molecular biologist than I\u2019m an accountant. So I\u2019m need a bit of clarification on a couple of points. Specifically, with the 606 related points forward of the revenue recognition. So do I take this is that you\u2019re now recognizing revenues when they reach a certain level of completion versus being shipped? And I guess, does that mean you can hold products for customers at your facility and still basically recognize the revenues for them. And if so, doesn\u2019t that cause like a spike up in working capital? Eric Green : Yes. That\u2019s what we talked about as when we looked at our DSOs. We said that our receivable book balance had gone up in a part of that was down to the rev \u2013 changes in rev and rev rec. And it\u2019s primarily we can\u2019t recognize products when it finish that primarily relates to our contract manufacturing business. Bernard Birkett : So let me add to this, Derik. It\u2019s a good question, because our contract manufacturing business, if you\u2019d a chance to visit our site, you\u2019ll realize that once we produce product, once it comes off to the line, they are transported to our customer within \u2013 immediately, whether it\u2019s that day or day after or the day after that. We don\u2019t hold the inventory in contract manufacturing. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve established the contracts with our customers. In the proprietary business, we are really make to order concept. We have very little inventory on hand and actually, in addition to that we don\u2019t really have any agreements that transfer titles to our customers at that point of time. So to really be clear on it, it\u2019s really in the contract manufacturing business, but we\u2019re not holding the inventory. We are shipping as soon as we have it produced. Derik DeBruin : Great. Thanks for the clarification. Did \u2013 unless I missed it, did you reiterate the 6% to 8% revenue growth guide for 2018? And if so, where on the spectrum are you now looking at it, given you\u2019re running 6% for the first half of the year. Bernard Birkett : Yes. We reiterated that and we\u2019re looking at the midpoint. Derik DeBruin : Okay. And can you talk a little bit about, I mean, I know some people asked this, I just want to little bit more clarity. Can you quantify the impact on the quarter to the initial stocking orders and the low margin tooling sales on organic revenue basis? Eric Green : The tooling for Q2 was relatively consistent to the Q2 of last year, except for about $2 million. So that\u2019s the delta. We do have tooling almost on a quarterly basis, but the delta for Q2 is about $2 million. Derik DeBruin : And the stocking orders, any \u2013 I mean, is that the pull forward from the\u2026 Eric Green : No stocking orders. I mean, to be clear, there was an increase in demand from our customers to increase volume for our facilities, because their demand to their end markets are increasing. We started, to give you an example, in our \u2013 with some of the products in Dublin, we started this journey with a customer and utilization of the existing equipment, because that\u2019s a ramp up process, we\u2019re not at full capacity. So we do have the ability to put more product to the existing assets, which we\u2019re currently working on, because we\u2019re not going from 0 to 100 within the first couple of months. It\u2019s been several months. We do believe by the end of the year will be pretty much full \u2013 full tilt on the current assets. Derik DeBruin : Great, that\u2019s help. And just one final question. You changed your pension accounting, which is like a little bit of a net benefit to the second order versus the old way. What are the 3Q 2017 and 4Q 2017 op margins under the new method, so we can better model to year-over-year comps. Eric Green : Can we give us a second here for one moment. We have it. So it\u2019s about \u2013 the total value was about $700,000 per quarter. So that gives you a feeling of the impact of the pension accounting rules. Derik DeBruin : Great, thanks. Eric Green : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Hillary with Roubaix. Your line is now open. Christopher Hillary : Hi, good morning. Eric Green : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Hillary : I just wanted to ask, we\u2019re finally in a clearly inflationary environment and how do you see your business handling that? Eric Green : Yes, there\u2019s two ways to look at it. One is in our Contract Manufacturing business, we do have agreements with our customers that when raw materials increase, escalate, we are able to pass along to our customers. So when we look at net price contribution for our business, it really is from a proprietary perspective, because it\u2019s somewhat neutral when it comes to Contract Manufacturing. In the Proprietary business, we have hedging programs put in place for our key raw materials, and we also do adjust our prices on a regular basis to accommodate inflations that we may occur, whether from raw materials or others costs that we incur. So that\u2019s to the extent that we see at this point to our business. We have the ability to pass through in appropriate ways. Christopher Hillary : Okay. And then maybe just one other one. You talked a lot today, thank you, about the high-value products and the growth that you\u2019re seeing there. Are there any products you highlight that you think will be either new or driving the growth in the next sort of one to three years? Eric Green : No, absolutely. So within the high-value product portfolio, we are launching \u2013 it\u2019s a journey. So if you start thinking about NovaPure, which is the highest quality, qualified \u2013 designed product portfolio within high-value products, we are seeing really good penetration there, very high growth, but again, it\u2019s a small base, but this tends to be more in the pipeline molecules for new approvals. And we anticipate over the next several years for that to continue to grow. We also have the conversion towards Westar Select to leverage our operations that we invested in, both Kinston and Waterford. And that will also be a journey over the next couple of years. I\u2019m very pleased on the initial response by our generics customers with AccelTRA. We launched that less than a year ago, but the number of samples and customers that are going through stability and approval processes gives us confidence that the whole value proposition is resonating with our customers, and you\u2019ll see more conversion towards AccelTRA, again, a high-value product portfolio. And the last one I\u2019m just thrilled to talk about is the devices side, where SelfDose, and that\u2019s early into the marketplace, and we\u2019ve been able to launch as a combination with one of our customers, combination device. And we are seeing positive response by other customers, and we believe in the next 12 to 18 months, we\u2019ll have one or two more to share with you with the adoption of SelfDose. So I believe there\u2019s multiple opportunities for West to continue to drive new innovations into the marketplace and you see a comment theme here that we\u2019re pushing up on the value proposition, so that we continue to drive margin expansion through the mix shift. Christopher Hillary : Great. Thank you very much. Eric Green : Great. Thanks for your question. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for any further remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Sarah. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s conference call.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported our third quarter performance. We had solid sales growth in our Proprietary Product segment and another quarter of strong growth for Contract Manufacturing. We generated 13% growth in adjusted EPS, despite a difficult year-over-year comparison. Bernard will go over the detail later in the call. As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect that high-value product sales will continue to drive growth in the Proprietary Products segment, and as mentioned on past calls, we should see a moderation in contract manufacturing growth due to a strong fourth quarter last year with greater than normal tooling revenues. And Slide 4 shows our organic sales performance by quarter across both segments of our business. In the third quarter we had organic sales growth of 9.6% the highest level in the past two years. We had another outstanding performance in our Contract Manufacturing segment and our Proprietary Products statement grew high-single-digits despite softness in Biologics. Let me provide greater detail of the individual proprietary market units, starting with Biologics. The performance in Biologics was driven by two factors : first, as discussed on the last call we have a couple of customers that are working off of inventories that were built in preparation for drug launches, while others have made the decision to upgrade to a higher value product and need to work off their current product inventories. These are timing issues and we expect a return to a more typical ordering pattern through 2019 and anticipate stronger high-value product sales as a result; second, our self-injection delivery devices contributed to lower than expected commercial sales. As a supplier to drug companies our success is ultimately correlated with our customer's commercial success. We have a number of new development programs in the works and as they progress into commercialization, our growth will be associated with a more diverse group of drugs and that should lead to more consistent sales performance. That said, we continue to see growth with many customers who are purchasing high-value components for the new Biologic drugs. We know that customers are looking for high quality, reliable, and readily available solution to contain and deliver their large molecules. In this quarter we saw double-digit growth in high-value product categories such as Westar RS and RU and NovaPure. The fact that our overall business can offset softness in our Biologics unit and still generate 9.6% overall organic sales growth in Q3, is a testament to our robust product and service offerings and the diversity of our customers we serve. Our generics market unit grew mid-single-digits in the third quarter and is on track to finish the year strong. This growth is driven by volume and high-value product conversions and the long-term outlook is positive. We see growing interest in our AccelTRA Components Program. We have sampled more than 100 customers and secured our first commercial sales. The Pharma market unit grew strong double-digits. As a reminder, we believe the underlying Pharma market volume growth is in the low-single-digits. So the mid-teens growth we saw this past quarter is atypical. Driving this impressive result was a number of factors including, high-value product conversion success, increased adoption of our Vial2Bag product in the hospital setting, and a favorable year-over-year comp due to inventory destocking activity last year. In Pharma we expect to finish 2018 on the solid growth trajectory. Turning to Contract Manufacturing. We had another stellar quarter with 20% organic sales growth. This growth was driven by continued escalation of demand for diabetes-related diagnostics and drug delivery devices, which reflects strong patient demand in the market. As a result, we expanded capacity sooner than originally anticipated and we're seeing the results of that effort in our performance this year. We expect overall Contract Manufacturing sales in Q4 to remain around Q3 levels as we continue to address this increased demand. Turning to Slide 5, I want to give you an update on our self-injection delivery platforms SmartDose and SelfDose. With an FDA approval in two years of performance data in hand, we have proven that SmartDose is a viable delivery device for large volume and highly viscous drugs. We have two SmartDose customers commencing clinical trials. Multiple ongoing development projects, as well as several feasibility agreements that have recently been signed. Earlier this year, we had the first commercial launch of a drug used in the SelfDose patient controlled injector. We're pleased with the post-launch reception from customers which has resulted in increased development activities. We have learned a few lessons over the years, as we work to bring our self-injection delivery devices to market. First, customer interest for self-injection platforms continues to grow and feedback on our proprietary device technology to address this market needs has been well received. Second, the development cycle is long and regulatory hurdles are high. Our teams have demonstrated the ability to work with our customers to help them successfully, bring these innovative combination products through the regulatory approval process and into the hands of patients. And finally, long-term commercial success of our devices will depend on the commercial success for customer's drugs, fulfilling a diverse and broad customer base and product portfolio, which we're doing, is key to long-term success. We remain confident that along with the expansion of our component offering and administration systems, our device strategy will allow us to continue to meet the future needs of our customers. Turning to Slide 6. We announced at the two recent major Industry Conferences, the launch of our Integrated Solutions program. We have talked about how much complexity exists when bringing a combination product to the market. Our customers operate in highly regulated markets and the amount of testing and support services required to gain approval is challenging. At West, we have expertise that is unrivalled in the industry which can help our customers simplify the journey throughout the drug development cycle. We have bundled these services in a comprehensive offering that's complementary to our high-value product and device strategy. We have received positive feedback from our customers since our launch and look forward to bringing this Integrated Solutions program to our full customer base. With a solid Q3 behind us, we're reaffirming full-year 2018 guidance and are focused on finishing out the year strong by executing on our market led strategy. We are addressing our customers' unique needs with both our products and also with the services and technical expertise that West can deliver and our One West management system is driving improved gross margin and optimized capital spending in addition to delivering innovative manufacturing strategies that have led to better service to customers. We are early in our journey, but are confident that this global operational system will continue to yield benefit to West and to our stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on the financial performance and our long-term outlook. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning everybody. So let's review the numbers in a little more detail. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 7 and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures are described in Slides 12 to 16. In continuing to deliver on our objectives, we are pleased to report for the third quarter, reported net sales of $431.7 million representing continued strong top-line growth of 9.6% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit of $135.6 million is $10.5 million or 8.4% above Q3 of 2017. Adjusted operating profit of $63.1 million was slightly above Q3 2017's $62.9 million. Other income in 2017 included a $9.1 million cost reimbursement of a safety technology we licensed to a third-party. This is approximately a 17% increase excluding the Q3 2017 license gain. And adjusted diluted EPS of $0.76 as compared to $0.67 last year represents an EPS growth of approximately 13%. Excluding the impact of stock option exercise tax benefits from both periods and the license income of $9.1 million included in Q3 2017, adjusted diluted EPS grew approximately 27%. Taking a deeper dive into our sales performance, we have seen sales growth in each of our business segments. Slide 8 shows the components of our consolidated sales increase. As already highlighted, consolidated third quarter sales were $431.7 million, an increase of 9.6% over Q3 2017 at constant exchange rate. Proprietary Products sales increased 6.6%, price increases accounted for 1.5% of the sales increase. Our high-value product sales increased mid-single-digits. Sales growth was led by our Pharma market units which had double-digit sales growth in the current quarter. Generic market unit sales growth was in the mid-single-digits. Sales to Biologic customers showed a mid-single-digit decline over the prior year quarter, as Eric has noted. Our high-value products represented 59% of Q3 2018 sales, approximately the same level as achieved in our Q3 2017. For the full-year of 2018, we expect mid-single-digit sales growth in high-value products. Contract Manufactured product net sales increased by 20.1%. New product launches in late 2017 particularly in our Dublin and Arizona facilities in support of diagnostic and delivery systems for treatment of diabetes are driving much of the increase in sales. So let's take a look at margin performance. Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin for both Q3 2018 and 2017 of 31.4%. Proprietary Products third quarter gross margin of 37% was 120 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2017. This continued improvement in gross margin is primarily due to mix, production volume, and efficiencies coming from our cost down operational strategies and One West management system initiatives, which more than offset the $2.7 million of overhead cost increases in Waterford. The Waterford facility generated its first sales of commercial product in Q3 and we expect continued improvement in operational efficiencies as our utilization of this facility increases. Contract Manufacturing third quarter gross margin of 14.3% decreased by 200 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. However margins increased over Q2 2018 in line with our expectations and comments on our Q2 call. The decrease in margins is principally due to start-up costs associated with launching new programs and idle capacity at facilities undergoing restructuring and product transfer activities. We have continued confidence that Contract Manufacturing margins will improve further in the fourth quarter and on into 2019, as we complete our restructuring activities, continue to improve our efficiency and utilization levels, and deliver on the new customer program. Q3 2018 consolidated SG&A expense increased 3.7% versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, third quarter 2018 SG&A expense was 15%, a decrease of 70 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2017 and in line with our expectations. Slide 10 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $215.4 million for the first nine months of 2018, an increase of $33.6 million compared to year-to-date 2017. Part of this improvement is the non-recurrence of a $20 million voluntary pension contribution made in the prior year. Our year-to-date capital spending is $74.7 million, $26.6 million or approximately 26% lower than a year-ago as we have completed our major construction projects in Ireland. Now let's review some balance sheet takeaways. Slide 10 also shows our cash balance at September 30 of $297 million and $61 million more than our December 2017 balance, an improvement of approximately 26%. Debt at September 30, 2018, of $196 million is roughly the same level as at year-end and on a net debt to total invested capital ratio basis, we are completely delevered. Working capital of $561 million at September 30th was $97 million higher than at year-end. In addition to the increase in our cash balances which were represented 63% of the increase, most of the remaining increases in receivables related to the growth of our business and an increase in our daily sales outstanding metric. We have seen improvements in our inventory metrics as our days in inventory have reduced by approximately 8%. As we consider Q3 results and look to the end of the year, we have reaffirmed our sales and adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2018 which is summarized on Slide 11. We are reaffirming our full-year sales of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion and adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $2.80 to $2.90. We anticipate Q4 sales in our Proprietary business be in mid-single-digits and Contract Manufacturing sales approximately even when compared to Q4 2017. Recall that Contract Manufacturing recorded large tooling sales in Q4 2017, as we prepared for the 2018 increases in our Contract Manufacturing business. Fourth quarter gross margins for the Proprietary business should be consistent with our year-to-date 2018 performance, while we expect improved margins in our Contract Manufacturing segment. All projections continue to anticipate a Euro exchange spot rate of $1.15 per Euro for the remainder of 2018. For the first half of 2018, we used $1.20 per Euro. The lower end of the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range reflects the company's expected performance and $1 million of tax benefits from stock compensation in the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to expect our 2018 full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25% excluding the impact of the tax benefit from option exercises. We're also revising our capital spending guidance. The new range is expected to be in a range of between $110 million and $120 million which is below the prior range of between $120 million and $130 million. Approximately half of our planned capital spending is dedicated to advanced manufacturing growth and innovation initiatives, with the remainder on normal maintenance, replacement, and information systems. So to summarize the key takeaways for the quarter, continued strong consolidated sales growth and 8% increase in gross profits, strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS over Q3 2017, together with strong operating cash flow growth, the completion of our restructuring activity, the ramp up of production on new customer programs and the increased usage of our Waterford facility bodes well for West future's profitability. I now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. With a strong Q3 completed, we have a good momentum to finish 2018 and a solid foundation to build upon for next year. We will share our guidance for 2019 at our year-end call in February. We are focused on initiatives across the company to support our vision to be the World Leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable drugs; focused execution of our market led plan will result in above market organic sales growth, gross and operating margin expansion, EPS to free cash flow growth, and ROIC expansion. We have a great team and we're well-positioned to deliver on our commitments to our customers, patients, and to shareholders for both the short and long-term. Haily, we will open and take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the Paul Knight of Janney. Your line is open. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. Could you talk to the capacity utilization right now in Ireland are you at 5%, 10%, where you want to be next year and then overall new products obviously hitting your organic number, what would you highlight as some of those new products picking up this organic pace? Eric Green : Great, good morning Paul and thanks for the question. We started thinking about the investments we made in Ireland is really twofold, one is in Waterford. We had our first two shipments, two different products one is high-value product finishing, the other one is products used in the diabetes care market. Those particular -- those particular products shipped at the end of Q3 and as you can imagine utilization of that plant is very low at this point. And so over the next coming quarters, we'll continue to transfer product into Waterford but also new projects, customers have asked us to take on especially on Westar Select. Up in Dublin, we've expanded, as you know, on our Contract Manufacturing sites, we have new technology put into the facility particularly focused on diagnostics and diabetes-related delivery devices. I would say at that point in time, we're built -- we're ramping up, we're clearly nowhere near a 100%, I would say more around the 50% range at this point in time and we have room for additional growth of those -- of that particular plant. So two stories really for the different locations. From a new product point of view, Paul, our growth the high-value product is the core fundamental growth of West and what we continue to see is our teams in the market units are putting together very clear value proposition. If I use AccelTRA as an example, I can tell you that the expectations of the customer uptick on sample and discussions with our customers is far exceeding our expectations at this point. I think resonate very well on the generic space. We're also having expanded our NovaPure product portfolio such as Syringe Plungers and also looking at more capacity. From a device point of view, we just started early tourney on SelfDose with the level of interest continues to climb, we're very confident that SelfDose will have another growth driver and high-value products in the near future. And I can't take -- miss the opportunity to say SmartDose is also -- the increase is really taken off. The last question on administration systems, the Vial2Bag, the capacity put in Puerto Rico where first shipments are coming up this quarter is more of a pull versus a push. So I'm very confident administration systems will drive another lever of growth in our proprietary portfolio. Paul Knight : And your tax rate guidance is centered around three option or three stock expense, right? Eric Green : Yes. Paul Knight : What would you -- is there any guidance range you would provide post stock expense or is that like too difficult? Bernard Birkett : That's difficult for us to determine because it's completely outside of our control, that's people exercising options. On a ballpark, we're estimating about a $1 million potential impact again, but that's for Q4, but again that's something that's hard for us to predict. Eric Green : Paul, one of the -- if you look back Paul to 2017 the impact on our EPS is about $0.44 based on the stock-based comp and if you look at year-to-date what we've produced today in our results is about $0.18. That gives you kind of the large swing that we've had over the last two years on the stock-based compensation tax benefit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Windley of Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, in the past the out year longer-term guidance commentary, I guess specifically for the next year on the third quarter call has been a little more specific in regard to the 6% to 8% growth range and I was curious about kind of the changing characterization of that and does that mean should we read into that that there is any say maybe not change in your outperformance of the market but a change in your view of the underlying market or something like that that prompted the kind of different characterization there? Eric Green : Yes, David thanks for the call and good morning. When I look at the -- what we've historically talked about the financial construct for West, I see no change in and so I think about the overall performance of the company from the top-line and also from a margin expansion point of view. So what we've decided especially with Bernard new to the characterization is to take the opportunity to really think about let's just finish the year strong for 2018 and we will give clear guidance in the early part of 2019 and how we look at that that full-year but also well beyond that. David Windley : Okay. Got it, thanks. And then Bernard, I think you may be touched on components of CapEx in the end of your prepared remarks but if I missed some of those I apologize but can you speak to the kind of the sustainability of the lower level of spending that you're seeing in 2018. I think management has commented about kind of the major building projects being done and how should we think about CapEx demands kind of longer-term? Bernard Birkett : Yes, if we're looking at longer-term and we're not planning to do any major construction projects or anything in the short to medium-term future, so obviously that has an impact on the level of CapEx that we're going to have on the guidance that we've given and particularly for 2018, and I would -- looking to 2019, we will firm up the numbers for 2019, as Eric said, when we give overall guidance. But that, that's one of the major drivers there that we don't really foresee those large building projects and also we're really focused on focusing on utilization of the existing asset base that we have and driving more out of the investments that we've already made. So again not looking to add really large amounts of CapEx. When we look at CapEx, we divided into three areas, we're looking at maintenance which is probably just under 50% and then the balance really focused on growth and investments in our IT systems. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Very good quarter considering obviously the Biologics was a little bit less than expected. I think you had sort of guided towards at least we were expecting sort of high-single even low-double in that and came in sort of a mid-single-digit sales decline, you called out the obviously the slower, it sounds like one particular product on the self-injectable is that right and then obviously the continuance of the inventory destocking, I guess that's just going on longer than expected is that sort of the two variables that or the difference from what you originally expected in this? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, that's correct. When you think about the self-injection is really around the SmartDose at this -- today, but when we start think about looking the out years we still remain confident and that's just the products that's in commercial phase but there's several development improvements that we have in place that we're working towards. So that gives us confidence about the future opportunity with SmartDose. And in regards to the Core Elastomer high-value products, we've worked with a few customers on transitioning from existing configuration to a future state configuration and in order to do that appropriately, we were seeing them destock and then ramp up. I can assure you that one of those customers, their entire injectable medicine portfolio is on West or West is on their entire portfolio. So we're confident of the future growth it's just the timing. I just want to put in perspective the Biologic units is significantly less than 10% of number of units we've produced in our Proprietary business units. So you can imagine a shift towards one large customer has a significant impact on the volume component. But we're close to these customers, we're confident; we're for long-term viability and success. Larry Solow : And you're confident that that sort of it sounds like Q4 will see similar declines and then you're -- it seems like you're confident that you'll get a rebound in 2019, is that fair to say what is your visibility on that? Bernard Birkett : We're expecting to see some improvement in the fourth quarter, so we wouldn't be looking at another decline and then weren't expecting to see growth rates ramp as we go through 2019. Larry Solow : Okay. And then just a follow-up on that the margins actually did okay all-in considered actually had a year-over-year decline of 100 bps gain I believe a little more than that on the proprietary side despite the slower biologics sales, as we look out assuming the biologics return sort of normalized growth and you did some better overhead of capacity absorption coming out of Waterford. It's fair to say that maybe as we look at 2019 and maybe even 2020, you can get even a larger than normal better pickup on margin on the margin side? Eric Green : Yes, Larry that's a great question. When I look at where we are today and we could talk about some of the pressures we had in 2018 particularly around Contract Manufacturing. The top-line is growing extremely fast but the margin expansion was not there actually contracted and that was really due to start-up costs associated bringing on people and facilities and frankly our customers have to support forward in manufacturing more volume today than we would have few quarters down the road and that's why we've got such a high growth rate. And the demand for their products the market is exceeding what we could supply at this point in time. So it's a good situation, where we had growing pains of getting the facilities up and running the last couple of quarters and we're working through that in Q4 we will be back to more steady state going into 2018. So it's one of the pressures that we had. But I also want to comment that this One West system that we put in place over the last year, year-and-a-half through our global operations is gaining traction. And we're sort of thinking about proprietary having over 100 basis point expansion on the margin with its softness in biologic which tends to be the highest margin portfolio we have gives you a clear indication of how much traction we can gain by continuously leveraging this mindset of clearly looking global and leveraging our existing asset base. So while there might be a few headwinds we may face in the future, we will overcome them through these initiatives we have in place and continue to see the margin expansion in the broader business. Larry Solow : Okay, great. And then just lastly on your restructuring efforts those still -- any changes there, still sort of in line with your expectations and still expect to get, I think you had said $0.10 to $0.15 I forgot the exact number, but savings by year-end 2019? Eric Green : Yes. So when we look at the programs that are put in place and the team that's leading that, they're hitting their milestones. So I'm confident that we will continue to see the consolidations take place we are working with our customers to ensure smooth transition as we move couple of plants to other locations. So we're on track. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Flanders of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Dana Flanders : Hi, thank you very much for the questions. I guess on the Pharma segment, can you quantify or just help frame the impact of Vial2Bag is having on that segment and when you might lap that impact or that impact would normalize, just trying to get a better sense of how to think about the Pharma growth in 2019? Eric Green : Yes, so when you think about the growth that we had specifically in the Vial2Bag just to recall our -- the investments we made in Puerto Rico which is one of our contract manufacturing space with their expertise core competencies around injection molding, so we're able to bring that production expansion in Puerto Rico and they're just starting to ramp up as we speak at this point in time. The growth that you've seen in Pharma for Q3 in particular has mostly been around the high-value product, conversions, and a little bit of the year-over-year comparison perspective. The incremental growth in that unit, smaller portion was actually attributed to administration systems. There was growth there but it's a smaller, smaller element of growth, it's actually less than 5% of total sales is what our administration systems are in the Pharma unit. Dana Flanders : Okay. And I know you mentioned the weakness in biologics impacting gross margin to some extent in Proprietary Products, is it fair to say that you expect that segment to expand margins into 2019 as these cost efficiencies go into place and biologics returns to growth? Eric Green : Yes, Dana absolutely. The opportunity we have with biologics what's really exciting is our customers are adapting the higher portfolio within high-value products. I will give an example there's more interest in NovaPure and so the higher you go in that that spectrum a continuum that we have value continuum, the better the margins are. So it should be a natural lift that we'll see in our -- due to the biologic stronger performance in the coming quarters. Dana Flanders : Okay, great. Bernard Birkett : Just to put that in context, there are a number of drivers that we have for gross margin expansion and leading to operating margin expansion. So biologics will affect mix and that's one of them and then obviously on the operational cost down strategies in One West Systems that we have in place, so we are not just reliant on one area for margin expansion, there are a number of things that will drive it. Dana Flanders : Yes, okay, that makes sense. That's it from me. Thank you very much. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Dana. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the Derik DeBruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik DeBruin : So a couple of questions. So I guess just to make the math little easier, what's the specific sales impact from FX in Q4 that you're forecasting and I guess obviously FX is a big player for you guys and so your initial thoughts on 2019 on how you see FX moving? Bernard Birkett : Versus our original forecast we're entering we have 120 versus 115, we expect that's about a $7 million impact on the quarter. Derik DeBruin : Okay. Bernard Birkett : And that's what we called out as well on our Q2 call. Derik DeBruin : Yes, all right and for 2019 any initial thoughts? Eric Green : Derik, it's a bit early what we're going through our forecast right now and as we already mentioned, we give full guidance on our Q4 call but just to again put it in context, we're looking at above market organic growth and growth in operating margin expansion into 2019. Derik DeBruin : Got it. So what was the Proprietary Product backlog this quarter and last you used to give us numbers, I'm just wondering can you completely update us on that? Bernard Birkett : Yes, I can give you the -- it's slightly above end of the year; I'm sorry December of 2017 number it's roughly $263 million. And I -- let me be clear though, there's some operating changes that we've made to better service our customers. One is our cycle times, lead times have dropped considerably over the last 12 to 18 months, I mean you're talking almost in many cases 2 to 1 ratio. And then, secondly, we have with a couple of our large customers more of a just in time model that we put in place that allows us to plan manufacturing at a very short period of time for these particular customers. So it\u2019s more of a plan pull effect from our operations into their operations. So I can't sit here and say that is an absolute like for like number, in fact I would say that would be somewhat deflated because of the initiatives that we put in place. Derik DeBruin : Got it, that's helpful. Bernard Birkett : Okay. Derik DeBruin : And just two more quick ones on just housekeeping, I mean obviously you had a little bit more of a tax benefit this quarter than you thought, I guess by your estimate how much EPS moved from 4Q to 3Q based on the option exercise? Bernard Birkett : Probably $0.03 to $0.04. Derik DeBruin : Got it. And then one final one, I've covered the stock for 10 years and this was the first time I've not heard the company give the specific outlook for the top-line margin on the third quarter call. I'm just -- as it -- I'm just raise the story when companies sort of vary from that -- is that sort of -- is that more of new CFO being on board and you're sort of -- and your thoughts on that or anything else going on sort of a repeat to Dave's question? Bernard Birkett : Yes, it's really my perspective on really providing information to the market, I think we've given a holistic view of how we see our business growing in 2019 and it would be above market, the comp structure are the same, our focus is the same improving gross margin, operating margin and EPS and so it's -- there isn't any reason other than that. Eric Green : Yes, Derik I will just add to this absolutely, I mean it is if you have seen in last 10 years, I mean the change back I can tell you from our view of the business, we still remain very confident and we don't see a change. However we've decided to give the full-guidance in greater detail and transparency in our February call going forward. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations for any closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Haily.

I now turn the call over to West\u2019s CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We made good progress in 2018 to execute our market-led strategy, focusing on the containment and delivery of injectable medicines and the globalization of our operations. And the results of these efforts are driving our 2019 outlook and beyond. We see no change in the positive market trends that support our business. More and more prescription medicines are being developed as injectable drugs. Our customer base continues to grow around the world with faster growth in Asia-Pacific and South America. The bar for quality and reliability continues to be raised by both our customers and global regulators. Our customers continue to request technical and regulatory services to support the packaging and delivery of their products. And companies are looking to couple their drugs with differentiated delivery devices to improve patient adoption and adherence. Each year, we have seen growing interest in demand for our high-value product offerings, device platforms and our Contract Manufacturing services. As we look to 2019, we are focusing the forecast organic growth in line with our long-term financial contract. Before I review the specifics of our 2018 performance, I want to address the voluntary recall of Vial2Bag, which was announced in January. The recall was prompted by reports of potential variable dosing with our 13-millimeter device. Less top priority is ensuring the quality of our products and the safety of the patients using them. It was this patient-first mindset that drove us to recall the entire Vial2Bag portfolio. So that we can thoroughly analyze these reports and ensure that our products can be safely used. Our hospital customers tell us that our Vial2Bag devices has significantly advanced the standard of care for medicines, delivered by way of infusion. We continue to believe strongly in Vial2Bag and are working closely with the FDA and other regulatory bodies with the aim of getting back to the market as soon as we can. Because we have built a diverse portfolio of high-value products and services, we still anticipate 6% to 8% organic growth in 2019. Let\u2019s take a look at each of the market units now. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of sales performance in 2018. With the impact of voluntary recall, Pharma was flat in the fourth quarter. However, the underlying fundamentals of this market are intact and the rest of the Pharma business continues to perform in line with our expectations. Generics finished the year on a solid note. We continue to have strong growing interest in our AccelTRA product line and our Generics market unit has seen heightened adoption of our self-injection devices. Turning to Biologics, I am pleased to report that Biologics returned to growth in the fourth quarter, even up against a difficult comp from last year. With most of the headwinds that we experienced last year behind us, we are encouraged with a strong start to this year and can report Biologics is on track to grow as expected. Contract Manufacturing ended the year with a sales run rate similar to that of Q3 as we anticipated. This segment grew sales significantly in 2018. It is all the more impressive when we step back and consider we had a gap from the loss of consumer product sales last year and a challenge to scale up production for multiple customers in the diabetes space. As we look to 2019, the focus will be on improving margins while we continue to grow the top line. We are working to address margin improvement with the addition of value-added services and ongoing operational excellence initiatives. Let\u2019s turn now to operations and some of the progress we are seeing here on Slide 5. In only its second full year, our global operations team has generated improved plant utilization, while increasing our industry-leading quality metrics and lowering our capital-spending requirements. Our One West business operating system is delivering near-term efficiencies and best-in-class manufacturing practices to drive further growth and profitability. Highlights from last year include record-setting improvements in quality, safety and on-time delivery. 60 basis points of gross profit margin expansion led by 220 points from our Proprietary Products segment. The opening of our new state-of-the-art Waterford, Ireland site, and increased plant utilization across the network, which reduced capital expenditure to $105 million leading to a higher free cash flow generation. We are in early in our journey. The team is implementing more initiatives that will raise the bar in quality and leadtimes while we work to support new capacity for innovative products and reduce overall costs. Coupled with the gross margin lift we are getting from greater high-value product sales, we expect Global Operations to be a key lever for the company to achieve its long-term target of 100 basis points of operating profit margin improvement per year. West\u2019s stability to drive this margin improvement comes from the scale and scope of our Global Operations. On Slide 6, we are excited to highlight the development of our business in some of the fastest-growing and dynamic regions of the world. Sales in the Asia-Pacific and South American markets are currently about 10% of total sales and growing at double-digits. With manufacturing locations in Singapore, China, India and Brazil, and sales offices throughout many countries within these regions, West is well positioned in these growing markets. The quality standards imposed by regulators and customers alike in these regions continue to increase. And as a result, we are seeing strong high-value product demand. In an effort to further strengthen our market position in the Asia-Pacific region, we are pleased to announce that we have entered into an agreement to acquire the business of our distributor in South Korea. The transaction which is expected to close in April this year and is not factored into our current guidance includes customer relationships, related assets and employees. We are excited to build upon the strong foundation that our distributor has established with the global reach of our One West network so that we can deepen our presence in this fast-growing and strategic market. Slide 7 highlights the ongoing R&D strategy designed to fuel our future growth. This strategy is based on three core pillars and is generating new packaging components offerings, higher-quality products and self-injection technologies to address the needs of the market we serve. In 2018, we saw the launch of Westar Select, Daikyo D Sigma components and an extension of our AccelTRA product line. We also saw two commercial launches for our customers with our SelfDose patient-controlled injector. In 2019, we anticipate additional new product launches in line extensions across these core areas. In fact, I want to take a moment to share some exciting developments in the area of delivery devices. We continue to see strong customer interest in our SmartDose drug delivery platform. The SmartDose system was the first FDA-approved variable prefilled drug delivery combination product. Notably, we are seeing broad-based interest across our market units for this product. For example, scPharmaceuticals, one of our Generics customers, announced that it is moving its key pipeline drug forward with our SmartDose platform. This is just one example of a number of development agreements, our teams are executing. As our R&D team works to further advanced our self-injection technologies. These products will complement our high value product strategy to drive the company\u2019s future growth. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance and our long-term outlook. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning everybody. So let\u2019s review the numbers in a little more detail. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8 and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures are described in Slides 13 to 17. We reported for the fourth quarter, net sales of $422.5 million, representing organic growth 3.6% on a constant currency basis. Excluding Vial2Bag recall, organic constant currency growth would have been 6.3%. Gross profit of $133.2 million is $4.6 million or 3.6% above Q4 of 2017. Gross profit margin was 31.5%, a 60 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit of $67.1 million compared to Q4 2017 $60.4 million shows an improvement of 90 basis points. And adjusted diluted EPS of $0.73 as compared to $0.64 last year representing EPS growth of approximately 14%. Looking more closely at each segment of our business, Proprietary Products organic sales increased 3.7%. Our high-value products represented 56% of the Q4 2018 sales, approximately the same level as achieved in Q4 2017. For the full year 2018, we had mid-single-digit sales growth in high-value products as expected. Contract Manufacturing net organic sales increased by 3.1%, slightly above our expectations. Continued growth in support of diagnostic and delivery systems for treatment of diabetes are driving much of the increase in sales. On Slide 9, we showed the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $18.4 million, or 4.4 percentage points of growth. Sales price increased \u2013 increases contributed $2.5 million or 0.6 percentage points of growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $7.9 million or a reduction of 1.9 percentage points and the loss of a consumer contract manufacturing customer of $6.1 million or 1.5 percentage points. Moving onto margin performance, Slide 10 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 31.5% for Q4 2018, up from 30.9% in Q4 2017. Proprietary Products fourth quarter gross margin of 37% was 220 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017. This continued improvement in gross margin is primarily due to higher efficiencies and positive sales mix, which more than offset the impact from the voluntary recall, unabsorbed overhead from Waterford and a higher raw material costs. The Waterford facility generated its first sales of commercial product in Q3 and we expect continued improvement in operational efficiencies as our utilization of this facility increases throughout 2019. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross margin of 16.4% decreased by 370 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in margins is due to unabsorbed overheads from plant consolidation activities, start-up costs associated with the launch of new programs and unfavorable sales mix. However, margins continued to improve with an increase over contract manufacturing gross margins in Q3 2018, which was in line with our expectations and comments on our Q3 call. We have continued confidence that contract manufacturing margins will improve further into 2019, as we complete our restructuring activities, continue to improve our efficiency and utilization levels and deliver on the new customer programs. Q4 2018 consolidated SG&A expense remained relatively flat versus the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, fourth quarter 2018 SG&A expense was 14.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and in line with our expectations. Slide 11 shows our key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $288.6 million for the full year 2018, an increase of $25.3 million compared to full year 2017. Part of this improvement is the non-recurrence of a $20 million voluntary pension contribution made in the prior year. Our full year capital spending was $104.7 million, $26.1 million or approximately 20% lower than a year-ago. As we have completed our major construction projects in Ireland and as we begin to see the early benefits from our global operations initiatives on capacity utilization and optimization. Reviewing some balance sheet takeaways, our cash balance at December 31 of $337 million was $101.5 million more than our December 2017 balance, an improvement of approximately 43%. Debt at December 31, 2018, of $196 million is roughly the same level as at year-end 2017, and on a net debt to total invested capital ratio basis, we are completely delevered. Working capital of $610.7 million at December 31 was $146.7 million higher than at prior year-end. In addition to the increase in our cash balances and cash represents 69% of the increase, most of the remaining increases in receivables related to the growth in our business and an increase in our day sales outstanding metric. We have seen improvements in our inventory metrics as our days in inventory have reduced by approximately 2%. As we consider Q4 results and look ahead to 2019, we have provided our sales and adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2019, which is summarized on Slide 12. We expect our full-year sales to be in the range of $1.795 billion to $1.82 billion, representing an expected constant currency organic sales growth of 6% to 8% over 2018 reported net sales. This assumes a negative impact of approximately $30 million to full year 2019 sales based on current foreign currency exchange rates. We expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.77 to $2.89, which assumes operating profit margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points, and guidance excludes tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Excluding this, EPS growth is in the range of 6% to 10%. Growth excluding FX and tax benefit from stock-based compensation is in the range of 8% to 13%. To be clear, this guidance format is returning to the format we used in 2017, where we also did not include tax benefits from stock-based comp in guidance. To try to forecast these tax benefits would mean trying to forecast items we do not control, such as stock option exercises by our former and current employees. Instead, we expect to recognize potential tax benefits as they occur. As a result, as we recognize them, we expect to see upside in our adjusted diluted 2019 EPS guidance. CapEx for 2019 is forecast to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. So to summarize the key takeaways for the quarter, we saw continued consolidated sales growth, gross margin increases in our Proprietary Product segment and improving margins in our Contract Manufacturing segment. Strong growth and adjusted diluted EPS over Q4 2017, together with strong operating cash flow growth. All projections for 2019 are in line with our long-term construct of 6% to 8% revenue growth, operating margin improvement of 100 basis points and EPS expansion. I now like to turn the call back over to Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. Our work in 2018 has positioned us well to grow organic sales and expand operating margins to increase free cash flow, all in line with our long-term financial construct. Our diverse portfolio of high-value products and services is on track for continued growth, and will be fueled by new products in line extensions. We are making significant progress in our global operations to deliver improved efficiencies, while deploying cutting-edge manufacturing strategies to advance our already strong position in service and quality. We are confident in our strategy for continued growth across the geographies and markets we serve, for both the short and long-term and look forward to the coming year. Jimmy, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Understand. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hi Bernard, and everybody, it\u2019s a \u2013 thanks for the time. Question on guidance. The 6% to 8% obviously maintain kind of what you\u2019ve been talking about historically, yet the recall business is I guess out of numbers. What is causing you to have the confidence that you can maintain and in fact say your business, core business, seems to be a little bit better? Is that what you\u2019re saying? And what\u2019s behind that effectively? Eric Green : Yeah, Paul, thank you for the questions. This is Eric. When we look at the business in 2018, our confidence of stronger growth than we\u2019ve experienced in 2018, our core business, particularly in the proprietary products is really driven by the growth that we\u2019re starting to see in the biologics that we anticipated. So if we recall in 2018 biologics is relatively flat with due to some restocking and some replenishment of earlier launches. As we look into 2019, we believe in the biologics business units can return to what we consider as typical growth for West, which is in the high single digit range. And that really \u2013 that unit really drives the high value products. In addition to that, when we look at the generics business, we did fairly well in 2018. However, we\u2019re starting to see additional growth with the launch of new products like AccelTRA and the new interest around self-injection devices in that area, which has now been commercialized. So those are the key drivers. It gives us the confidence and the growth that we were going to be returning to that higher growth in the proprietary area. Quintin Lai : Paul, do you have any other questions? Paul Knight : I\u2019m sorry. Is \u2013 the operating margin expansion you\u2019re guiding due to this \u2013 again this growth you\u2019re guiding to in biosimilars and high value-add products there, Eric? Eric Green : Yeah. Paul, the driver of operating margin expansion is coming with a twofold. One is as we grow the high value products, high single, low double digits, that does give us some margin expansion naturally with the shift. And then the balance of that really is coming from our global operations. We\u2019ve demonstrated that we\u2019re gaining traction and particularly in the proprietary area of margin expansion and we\u2019re confident that we were getting our hands around the contract manufacturing area as we scaled up last year with a lot of \u2013 with new installed equipment that we should be able to get further margin expansion in that area in 2019. So it\u2019s a combination of both, Paul, as we kind of move forward throughout 2019. Paul Knight : And then lastly on the product recall, is there any associated liability? Can you measure that? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you. Eric Green : Yeah, thanks, Paul. I think just to be clear, when we look at the events that occurred in late 2018, we had a couple of reports from healthcare professionals, really the effect of a particular drug in the marketplace was oxytocin, which is variable and predictable when used with the Vial2Bag DC 13 millimeter device. When you look at the Vial2Bag portfolio, this particular device is a small percentage of that entire portfolio. We took a very \u2013 while there\u2019s not been a causal relationship determined between these events and the device, we\u2019ve taken the approach to ensure patient safety by pulling the entire portfolio at the market, while we do the analysis and work with the regulatory bodies to bring the product back onto the market at the appropriate time and we\u2019re doing everything we can to bring it back as soon as possible. We still believe in the product. Our customers are very keen to get the product back into the hospital sector because it\u2019s very supportive of what they\u2019re trying to get accomplished. So that\u2019s where we are, Paul, at this point in time. We\u2019re doing everything possible to ensure we\u2019ve done the root cause analysis, make sure everything is analyzed and gives us confidence we can go back to the market safely. Paul Knight : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Solow, CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Great, thanks guys. Just a quick follow up on the Vial2Bag. It sounds like you\u2019re erring on the side of patient safety, which obviously is what you should be doing. It seems like that the 25 million have been growing pretty fast. I guess the $11 million and a quarter, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s probably some seasonality there, but did you \u2013 do you expect this product back even sometime this year even though you don\u2019t really know for sure it\u2019s not included in guidance? Bernard Birkett : Well, when we look at our guidance, the range is pretty wide, so it covers a number of different eventualities. So, we got to be careful on the timing. We just have to make sure we do our work and we work with the regulatory authorities to make sure that you get it back as fast as possible, but our guidance reflects that. Larry Solow : But to be clear, is that \u2013 are you not including that number at all? Or are you actually incorporating it that it does actually get back even to some number \u2013 something in your numbers there, or is it sort of made it completely from guidance? Bernard Birkett : The guidance covers a range of possibilities. I\u2019ll put it to you that way. Larry Solow : Okay. Bernard Birkett : But even with that, we were still guiding to 6% to 8%. And the other thing, just to be careful that I think you mentioned there that it\u2019s about $11 million a quarter. And the annual revenue for 2018, the total revenue was $24 million for the year. Larry Solow : Right. That\u2019s what I was saying. So it seems like $11 million number, we shouldn\u2019t extrapolate. It sounds like there is some seasonality in that number, but I do believe that the $25 million annual number probably had \u2013 you had some pretty good growth this year. I know you have called it out in think in Q2, and Q3 is doing well. And perhaps that maybe that benefit a little bit from shortages in the solutions and bag side on the IV industry and the infusion industry itself, but it does sound like there was some considerable growth in that product, but not the $11 million quarterly, I get that. I just thought that\u2019s a seasonal shift. Bernard Birkett : Yes, that\u2019s a seasonal number. So that\u2019s the level of returns we saw. So there would have been inventory in the field and with our distributors. Larry Solow : Right. Okay. And then just on the free cash flow, obviously, you guys, I think operating cash flow grew 10%, free cash flow grew close to 40%. You did a wonderful job bringing CapEx down. I think it was even lower than the previous guide down and material lower from the last two years. If this $105 million plus or minus number, is this a sustainable level or something? Bernard Birkett : We\u2019ve guide at $120 million to $130 million for 2019. Larry Solow : Okay. Bernard Birkett : But we just call it right on our\u2026 Larry Solow : Right. But it is okay, actually I\u2019ve missed that. But I know last year I think you had originally guided towards a similar number in 2018 and you came down materially lower. Can you maybe sort of bridge what would drove the number down considerably from the guidance and what would change that this year? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, this is Eric. It\u2019s a good question. I know that a year ago or so we guided around $150 million to $175 million. I think prior years we\u2019re roughly around that area. And we think about the team we put together has truly globalized the operations about year and a half, two years ago. One of the remits was to start thinking about how do we utilize our assets more effectively instead of running each site independently. And therefore, what we have done is we have able to be identify where we put the next dollar of assets into which locations it really optimize the global network. So we guided this year at $120 million, $130 million. That\u2019s still includes incorporates about $40 million, $45 million a year for maintenance, which we need to do with all the process and equipments we have around the world. We do have about $10 million to $15 million to $20 million depending on the year around our IT infrastructure to continuously enhance that and improve our operating systems. And then, the balance of that has growth initiatives. And I can assure you that the growth initiatives are still quite prevalent in our conversations, but how we allocate, where that goes, we\u2019re starting to leverage existing assets instead of building new facilities. That\u2019s probably the biggest difference. So guiding at $120 million to $130 million, we\u2019re very confident in that corridor and that\u2019s what several new growth initiatives that we have in the pipeline in 2019 and also in 2020. Larry Solow : Okay, great. I appreciate that color. Just on the \u2013 you spoke to sort of Biologics returning to sort of this high-single-digit growth. If we exclude the Vial2Bag, high-value products is totality, it sounds like they should be sort of in line with that long-term high-value, high-single-digit growth as well in 2019. Eric Green : That\u2019s correct, Larry. And just to reiterate, the key driver of high-value products is really around the Biologics, heavy around the Generics with this whole new launch around AccelTRA product line. And also in the Pharma, but I would say mostly in the Biologics and Generics. And as we think about what 2018 and beyond back to the typical growth rates, it is a high-single-digit area. So that would be the key driver of the core thrust of high-value product growth for West. Larry Solow : Okay. Just last question, just on the ongoing restructuring, it sounds like it\u2019s progressing as planned and you guys called out sort of about $0.15 annualized benefit when complete. Do you expect to get some of this benefit even in the later part of 2019 or is that really a 2020 and going further? Eric Green : Yes. We have officially as of last month, one of the sites that we were consolidate into another location has been officially completed. So now that ongoing benefit and that\u2019s really in our contract manufacturing business that will be a slight benefit going forward in 2019. We are very close to finalize a larger consolidation between two plants there, literally 7, 8 miles apart from each other in Florida. And that will be completed roughly mid to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Q3, which gives us a little bit of benefit but most of the benefits in 2020. So we\u2019ll see some of that benefit you were referring to in 2019 but more majority has starts in the latter half, the majority of it starts in 2020. Larry Solow : Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dana Flanders with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Dana Flanders : Hi. Thank you for the questions. My first one is just on biologics. I know you talked about kind of the return to growth this year and some encouraging signs so far. It\u2019s also been relatively volatile. Have you just changed how you are approaching forecasting demand in that segment and are there any big launches this year that could drive volatility? Eric Green : Dana, thanks for the question and good morning. What we\u2019re seeing with biologics, to answer your first question about visibility. I would say the team\u2019s done a really good job over the last two quarters to re-look at on how to understand the drug uptake in the marketplace because that is what\u2019s creating the largest volatility and working with our customers. So a lot of work has been done. There\u2019s still more work that needs to be done, but there\u2019s a higher degree of confidence in the biologics business, as we started thinking about the demand. One of the areas we look at also while the numbers have changed because of our global operations cycle times have changed drastically, lose their backlog and the orders that come in for biologics. And we have a good \u2013 really good visibility in the near-term, i.e., two to three quarters. And that gives us really good confidence that our predictions through our analysis is coming through at this point of time. So I would say the headwinds we had last year that was spoke of are behind us. There will always be some volatility between quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t believe the drastic swings that we\u2019ve seen in the past. And if we are going to see that, we\u2019ll be very transparent. But on an annual basis, we do see this business back to what we expected as a high single driver in the marketplace. Dana Flanders : Okay. Thanks. And I guess my follow-up. Just on the South Korean distributor that you\u2019re buying. Just I want to clarify, did you say it\u2019s not included in guidance until it closed. And then how much top line do you expect it to contribute when it does close? Bernard Birkett : Yes, it\u2019s not built into the guidance. We will wait until it\u2019s obviously closed and completed before we would do that. But we believe for 2019, it will be relatively immaterial. And then as we develop that business out through 2019, it will have more of an impact in 2020. Dana Flanders : Okay. Thank you. Eric Green : Thank you, Dana. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik DeBruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik DeBruin : Hey, good morning and thanks for making the questions. And apologies if I\u2019m asking something you said earlier, I\u2019m juggling four calls this morning. So on the Vial2Bag, I mean, have you included a \u2013 what\u2019s your expectations for that coming back in 2019? And basically what have you do \u2013 what are you doing in terms of remediating that to \u2013 what do you have to do to fix it? Eric Green : Yes, Dana. What we\u2019re looking at is \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Derik. What we\u2019re looking at is we need to understand what the few cases that were presented in regards to a particular drug molecule is being used with the Vial2Bag DC 13 millimeter. Again, that\u2019s a small piece of all about the bag. And we took the approach to ensure \u2013 pull the entire portfolio off the line, precaution for patient\u2019s safety. And so right now, what we are undertaking is root cause analysis and collecting and analyzing data to determine the root cause of this variability on this particular molecule. And once we have that appreciation, then we are able to assess, if there\u2019s any implication on any other molecule and/or the 20 millimeter, which is majority of the volume that we produced and been selling into the marketplace. So we were well into this. We put our best and brightest people on this in our labs, our regulatory group, our quality group, engineering group, and we\u2019re working this on a daily basis with the regulatory\u2019s, the FDA and other foreign regulatory bodies. So we haven\u2019t articulated exactly when this will come back because we need to understand the data first, and then we\u2019ll be in a better position to make that comment. Derik DeBruin : Great. So on \u2013 just on the \u2013 what was the stock option contribution to fourth quarter? And I see, you\u2019re not including any benefits from stock option gains and your current guidance, but that seems a little bit unlikely. I guess, what sort of is a \u2013 what sort of a base level? Isn\u2019t it like $0.01 to $0.02 of a quarter base level just to sort of think about? Bernard Birkett : Yes, it\u2019s could be. We\u2019re not obviously \u2013 we said, we\u2019re not going to guide it, because it\u2019s out of our control. I think what we\u2019ve seen in the last number of years, it was higher given the level of retirement that had taken place and options that were exercised. We would expect that to normalize. So for the \u2013 just to keep everything clean and transparent, it\u2019s easier for us to guide without that, because we don\u2019t have control over the number. For the fourth quarter, it was about $1 million. Derik DeBruin : Great. And there\u2019s been some headlines with some of the \u2013 with Pfizer and some of their issues in terms of their injectable drug manufacturing. I guess could you sort of talk about, just where we are in terms of the \u2013 the industry has sort of been plagued over the years by sort of recalls and quality issues and certainly in India, these other ones. It\u2019s like, can you sort of talk about \u2013 sort of like sort of the status of where we are in the market right now, in terms of some of the \u2013 where you have the ability or it\u2019s like \u2013 or some of the issues that, you saw in the past the market have those sort of fallen by the wayside? Or we were normalized? It\u2019s basically, it\u2019s just a comment \u2013 it\u2019s just a question sort of like your competence and your visibility on the end market. Eric Green : Yes, Derik, that\u2019s a very question because we do take that in consideration as we started looking at the forecasts, particularly around the generics business. It tends to be the area, where there has been more 483s particularly in India in the past three or four years. And but from our vantage points, as you know, we work with majority, if not all the companies in the space. Our advantage is that there isn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not on the rise as much as it was a couple of years ago. So we do have visibility. One of the benefits that we do have is, if there was an issue of one particular firm, it doesn\u2019t happen immediately, but over a period of time, i.e., a few quarters later, we\u2019re working with another firm to help get the molecule on the market and then into the hands of patients. But I will \u2013 I think, Derik, what you raised those are very important comment, is that, there is a heightened awareness in the need for quality and global availability. And that\u2019s why \u2013 I believe \u2013 that\u2019s why, we are getting a lot of these phone calls to help solve some of these problems. And it actually underscores, why the team has come up to the AccelTRA portfolio because it addresses these needs exactly to the team. So that\u2019s what we see right now. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s on a raise, but we do see when it happens at one location, we usually work with another firm to get it back online. Derik DeBruin : Great. Thanks so much. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for any closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Jimmy. And thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s conference call.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you Quintin. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our Q1 call. I'm very pleased to report that we're off to a good start to the year and delivered a strong first quarter. Our team executed well on multiple fronts, with solid performance that demonstrates the success of our market-led strategy. The markets we serve remain robust and we're delivering differentiated products and services for our customers, which is driving above-market growth in all segments and market units. We continue to see good uptake of our new product pipeline, including an increasing number of development agreements for our delivery device platforms and continued growth momentum of our high-value product portfolio. And our global operations team is successfully delivering on its strategic initiatives, which is resulting in improvements to our quality and service metrics along with higher gross profit margins. As we look to the rest of 2019, we are reaffirming overall net sales guidance, despite the headwinds we are assuming based on current FX rates. We're also raising our EPS guidance to include the incremental tax benefits from stock-based comp we saw in Q1. We expect that strong high-value product mix shift and operations initiatives will offset some of the expected FX headwinds in the back half of the year. Let's take a closer look at the performance of the business. Slide 4 shows a summary of our first quarter 2019 sales performance. Before I get into the specific market units, I want to highlight the increasing demand for our high-value products. We saw strong double-digit growth in Q1. Based on market dynamics, as we see them today, we expect this trend will continue for the balance of 2019. Now let's turn to the details. In biologics, we had a strong quarter with double-digit organic sales growth. This was led by high-value product sales including NovaPure, Westar RU and Daikyo products. Many of the issues that affected 2018 organic sales growth are behind us, and we expect full year sales growth in this market unit to be in the double-digits. In generics, we grew high single-digits in the quarter. Leading the way was an increase in self-injection device development agreements for SmartDose and demand for SelfDose. We have a solid book of committed orders for HVP in standard components and we expect full year organic sales growth to be in the high single-digits. Our pharma unit grew low single-digits. We saw good uptake of our high-value products including Daikyo and Envision components, which offset the impact of the Vial2Bag voluntary recall we initiated earlier this year. Excluding this impact, pharma would have grown in line with our expectations at 3% to 4%. I want to provide a quick update on Vial2Bag. We're still working through the various actions associated with the recall and the work we need to do to bring this product back to market. Therefore, we don't have a specific time line to share with you yet. Our customers have made us aware of the positive impact that this product has had on patient care and we have communicated to them that we remain committed to returning to the market as soon as we can. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect pharma to have organic sales growth in the low single-digits. And to be conservative, we are assuming that Vial2Bag does not return in 2009 with meaningful revenues. Turning to Contract Manufacturing, we have strong double-digit sales growth led once again by health care related injection and diagnostic devices. As we look at the pacing for the next three quarters, we expect growth to moderate given the more difficult year-over-year comparables. Full year organic sales growth is expected to be in the mid single-digits. Slide five, provides a brief snapshot of our market-led strategy that continues to build on our leadership position, secures growth across the market units and provides increasing value to our customers. I'd like to cover a few highlights from the quarter that we believe will support our customer base even more broadly and effectively. First, to drive our digital transformation, we opened a new Digital Technology Center in India, which will serve as the global center of excellence. The team there will play an important role in our ongoing efforts to enhance customer engagement through digital marketing, digital manufacturing and automation to accelerate internal and external business processes. From a geographic expansion perspective, the Asia Pacific market continues to be an important driver for our growth. We have worked to strengthen our presence in the key markets there including China, India and now South Korea. In Q1, we finalized the acquisition of our South Korean distributor. We are excited to engage with our customers more directly in a strategic and growing market, especially for biologics as it is the home of leading global biosimilar companies. A significant pillar to our growth strategy is the globalization of our operations and I'm encouraged by the progress we're making. In Q1, we saw continued improvements in our quality and safety metrics and strong results from our focus on service to our customers. In an effort to maximize investment across our global footprint, we made progress on our previously announced restructuring plans with our former site in Indiana consolidated into our Williamsport Pennsylvania facility earlier this year. We are currently finalizing the consolidation of two more sites in the U.S. by the end of 2019. Our One West global operations business system is generating the margin improvement we anticipated with these and other strategic initiatives. In Q1, we reported an 80 basis point expansion of gross profit margin led by 180 points from our Proprietary Products segment. However, we still have more work to do in our Contract Manufacturing segment to improve our profitability. Bernard will review these actions -- or the actions we're taking later in this call. I truly believe a key differentiator for West is our ability to provide our customers with the scientific and technical support they need to bring their products to market in an increasingly complex regulatory environment. We saw continued momentum in this area of our business in the quarter. For example, in March, West and the PDA hosted more than 150 customers at our headquarters to discuss the latest advancement in the containment and delivery of combination drug products. This is just one instance of how our team has dedicated scientists and technical experts that put themselves at the forefront of industry efforts to ensure that customers can meet today's challenging drug development hurdles. Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett who will provide more detail on our financial performance and the long-term outlook. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric and good morning, everybody. Let's review the numbers in a little more detail. We'll first look at Q1 revenues and profits where we saw continued solid growth, while absorbing the impact of the Vial2Bag recall. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter and how we see it continuing to improve in 2019 in addition to some quarter-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review the guidance for 2019. First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on slide 6 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 11 to 14. We recorded net sales of $443.5 million representing strong organic sales growth of 11%. We also saw growth across each of our market units as Eric noted earlier. We are pleased to see continued improvements in gross profit. We recorded $146.8 million in gross profit, $12.4 million or 9% above Q1 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 33.1% was an 80 basis points expansion from the same period last year. We also saw improvements in adjusted operating profits with $71.3 million recorded this year compared to $56.7 million last year, a 25.7% increase. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 19%. So what's driving this growth in both revenue and profits? On slide 7 we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $44.5 million or 10.7 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $2.9 million or 0.7 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $19.6 million or a reduction of 4.7 percentage points. Taking a look at margin performance, slide 8 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 33.1% for Q1 2019 up from 32.3% in Q1 2018. Proprietary Products first quarter gross margin of 38.9% was 180 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in gross margin are; favorable mix of products sold, focusing on high-value products, sales price increases together with improved utilization and efficiency in operation. In fact, our high-value products represented 60% of Q1 Proprietary Products sales. We had double-digit growth for this area of the business in line with our overall strategy to grow HVP revenues and margin expansion. Contract Manufacturing first quarter gross margin of 14% decreased by 80 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease in margins is primarily due to an unfavorable mix of sales with higher-than-anticipated engineering and tooling sales and some onetime costs. However, margins on product sales expanded in the quarter compared to Q1 2018. As we continue to improve our efficiency and utilization levels, delivering on the new customer programs and improvements in margins on product sales, we have continued confidence that Contract Manufacturing margins will improve further into 2019. Operating margin grew by 250 basis points over Q1 2018, as we continue to expand gross margins and closely manage our operating expenses as we execute on leveraging our income statement. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On slide 9 we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $47.6 million for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of $2.6 million compared to the first quarter 2018. Our first quarter capital spending was $28.8 million, $0.8 million higher than a year ago. Working capital of $562.9 million at March 31, 2019 was $47.8 million lower than at December 31 2018, primarily due to the decrease in our cash balance. Our cash balance at March 31 of $266 million was over $70 million less than our December 2018 balance, primarily as we purchased 800,000 shares of our common stock under our calendar year 2019 share repurchase program at a cost of $83.1 million during Q1 2019. Now let's turn to guidance. Slide 10 provides a high level summary. First, despite increasing FX headwinds and taking a more conservative view on Vial2Bag revenues for 2019, we continue to expect our full year sales to be in the range of $1.795 billion to $1.82 billion, which represents expected organic sales growth of 6% to 8% over 2018 reported net sales and assumes a negative impact of $34 million to $37 million to full year 2019 sales based on current foreign currency exchange rates. Second, we are raising our full year 2019 adjusted diluted EPS to a new range between $2.80 to $2.90, compared to prior guidance of $2.77 to $2.89. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. At this point, guidance does not include any material revenues for Vial2Bag in 2019 and forecasted costs of remediation are included in our EPS guidance. FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.07 to $0.08, compared to full year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS based on current FX rates. The estimated impact on prior guidance was $0.06. So to summarize the key takeaways for the quarter, strong top-line growth in Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross margin improvement, growth in operating margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS over Q1 2018. Our projections for 2019 and performance to date are in line with our long-term construct of 6% to 8% organic sales growth, operating margin improvement of 100 basis points and EPS expansion. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Bernard. Our Q1 results underscore the value that our teams are providing to customers. At a recent customer advisory board meeting, we got feedback from key decision makers from various pharmaceutical and med device companies. They talked about the need for more systems and solutions that can support and improve patient care in the injectable space. We are addressing these needs with new product development and initiatives such as our integrated solutions programs. We're also expanding our capabilities to include drug handling and cold storage within contract manufacturing. All of which will allow us to partner more closely with our customers as they work to introduce new products to the market. Through the execution of our strategy we're focused on delivering on our financial goals to grow our business, expanding operating margins and generate more cash for our business to reinvest in our future. We're confident in our growth strategy across the markets we serve for the both short and long-term and look forward to carrying this momentum through the year. Jimmy we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric can you talk to the operating margin initiatives that you have undertook and are reflected in the quarter? And what you're doing in the months and years ahead? Eric Green : Yeah, good morning Paul, and thank you for the question. No, the team's done a good job and focused on driving margin improvements as we discussed it's been our focus of 100 basis points per year ongoing. And so there's two really key drivers. One is we're getting good mix shift with our solid high value product growth from a product point of view. And if you look at the outlook and the order book that we have on hand, we're pretty confident we should see continued growth and adoption of the high value product portfolio. When we move down the income statement, so thinking about in SG&A while there was some cost to the remediation of the Vial2Bag, we've offset that was really leveraging the existing asset base around the -- of our SG&A to be more effective on a global basis. And what you're seeing is it's really fallen down through to the operating margin expansion. So I would say those are the two biggest levers. One area that we need to focus and work on, the teams are very cognizant of that is expanding our margins in Contract Manufacturing. So we still have more work to do to continue that momentum there Paul. Paul Knight : And what's your -- what's latest on the Ireland facility, specifically capacity utilization in those facilities? Eric Green : Yeah. And specifically in Dublin, we're still ramping up on a couple areas, and are Contract Manufacturing in regards to -- in the diabetes space, and also in auto injectors. And so as we continue -- we're not at the full capacity at this point in time. As you know, as we install the capacity and we've seen ramp-up throughout 2019, so we should see closer to capacity towards the mid to the end of the year. When we think about Waterford, which is really the state-of-the-art facility for high-value product portfolio, we're seeing increasing demand in regards to our Westar Select offering that we recently launched. And while we're still -- obviously there's headwinds on cost of that facility until we fill it, they're dissipating because we're gaining more revenues through the plant as we speak. So to give you a number around that, we're probably about $5 million better this year than we were last year. Paul Knight : Okay. And lastly on Vial2Bag guidance, you are no longer assuming that that is a product and sales again this year, but is there any change in your process of getting that product or any change in customer feedback? Or is it conservatism? Thank you. Eric Green : No. I would -- thanks for the question. Now Paul, I would say at this point of time, the teams are working diligently to get -- working with the regulatory authorities to get the product back in the market. We are still getting significant response from the marketplace, particularly the hospitals saying that this product does create -- it helps them deliver better patient care. So we are working with them diligently. We've gone through user research human factors device testing, all the necessary steps, and I'm confident the team will have a product back to the market that we can continue to stand behind and support the healthcare the hospitals. We have -- as you noted, we reduced our guidance. We never reduce the guidance. The guidance stays the same. But we reduced the contribution of Vial2Bag to be conservative, because it's uncertain at this time exact point of time when we'll be back in the market. Paul Knight : Thank you very much. Eric Green : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Windley : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m wondering if you could first on that last question quantify the delta in guidance. Obviously, Eric you said, guidance didn't change, but what is the amount of change in Vial2Bag that you're absorbing in that guidance update? Bernard Birkett : We're probably taking about $12 million plus. David Windley : Okay. All right, very helpful. Thank you, Bernard. Eric on the -- to follow-up on Paul's question on efficiency and margin, I hear you talking about mix shift in HVP, and that certainly helps. We all know the margin differential there. You're also taking some absolute cost out. You mentioned Indiana, a couple other facilities to consolidate over the balance of this year. How should we think about that -- those activities influencing margin? Is it simply the $14 million that's listed in the press release that essentially comes out of the operating cost? Or are there more dynamics that we need to consider? Eric Green : Hey, David, it's a great question. I would tell you, it's on the spot two years now ago we pulled together the global operations. At that point of time, we had 28 sites. While you'd say it had a discrete purpose obviously to service our customers. By globalizing the operations, we have more opportunities to leverage across our operations globally. So to gain some point, we've created centers of excellence our investments around capital are going to specific sites for specific product portfolios. This focus is allowing us to leverage not just on capital investments, but also on labor. So think about burden reduction and you think about asset utilization, these are key indicators that we're looking at. It's not a one-year journey. It's a multiple-year journey. I'd say, we're still in the early stages, but I'm actually quite excited because it's \u2013 when you go to the plants, you're seeing it. You can see the improvements, when you're sort of getting \u2013 sitting down looking at the labor burden rates. So you're absolutely correct the gross margin expansion, while major thesis and driver of that is around high-value product conversion, this global operation opportunity and the One West business system we've put in place should enhance that on a \u2013 going forward on a continuous basis. David Windley : And so on that are we seeing that today? Or is that not really something that's materially impacting your financials yet? Eric Green : It's \u2013 I would characterize it as minimal at this point in time, because some of these site consolidations required costs and I know it's taken \u2013 we are looking at a restructuring on that part of the activity. But these are really early initiatives that we have in place, while we're seeing some of the benefit I would say the larger benefits are more forward-looking at this point, Dave. David Windley : Okay. Which is encouraging when I look at the margin performance, the idea that that's still to come is certainly encouraging on, so my last question is on this margin performance. If not the added benefit from what we just discussed, how did \u2013 what are the factors that drove kind of a 45% to 50% sequential incremental margin in Proprietary Products? So, looking at it that way or if I look year-over-year it was actually 100%. Talk about the various factors that are driving that kind of incremental margin improvement. Bernard Birkett : Yeah. That's \u2013 one of the major drivers of the margin expansion that you're seeing is really in the biologics as the high-value product growth. Let me get a little more granular. If you look at the NovaPure product portfolio that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, we've seeded the market. And it takes time to seed the market and get the expansion. I can tell you in the first quarter, the absolute dollar value of revenues is 2x, in NovaPure and you know where that fits in our portfolio of products it's the highest ASP and the most profitable. And so we're gaining traction on initiatives that we've seeded a couple \u2013 a few years ago that we're seeing come through and it's particularly in the biologics area. So you're right to point out that's one of the biggest drivers in the margin expansion that we have today. On a consolidated basis, it's true though that Contract Manufacturing's brought it back and that's why we have that focus to make sure that we continue to expand our CM business in addition to high-value product growth. David Windley : Got it. Great. Thank you very much. Very interesting. Bernard Birkett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Great quarter. Just a couple of questions on the margin enhancement is the \u2013 on the Proprietary Products particularly is that \u2013 these margins it sounds like with sustainable high-value \u2013 growth in the high-value products and ongoing efficiencies. Are these margins plus or minus somewhat sustainable as we look out through the year? Eric Green : I would say the \u2013 if you think about, we want to continue to have high \u2013 well, we are going to continue to have high-value product growth in double-digits for the balance of the year. It was very strong in Q1. We anticipate it to continue throughout maybe not as \u2013 it's by lower double digits in the second half, because of stronger comps. Now let me say that, we're still thinking about the margin expansion we do think it's sustainable. If you think about the thesis of \u2013 the high-value product portfolio while it's 60% of the revenues from a units perspective it's still about approximately 20% of the units. When we think about the pipeline of that we're feeding right now in the biologics and also the work we're doing with AccelTRA and generics in the opportunity for conversion over the next one or two years that's why we have confidence of continued healthy margin expansion to give us that 100-plus basis points of operating margins over long periods of time. Larry Solow : And it's really nice you received this NovaPure ground, because I was just looking back a couple of years ago, I had \u2013 some write-ups and I went ahead. It was just sort of in the beginning of a sort of hockey stick growth if you will but on the front end of it. And you mentioned two double contributions this year. Is that still -- I imagine on volume basis there's still lots of opportunity and I imagine still -- I don't know help me if you can. Bernard Birkett : Yeah. Larry it's a dimension that was about less than 2% of revenues last year for NovaPure. So -- but if you can -- we continue to focus on the pipeline and that's what drives this portfolio. It's what's in the pipeline that's coming through. We've been seeding it for, a period of time and that's the exciting part you think about the number of biologics that are in the pipeline more than they have been in the past. And the other exciting part is that, we're touching a lot of smaller biotech companies, if you look at our portfolio of customers. And there is a, statistic recently roughly around three-fourth of the drug molecules coming through are coming from the smaller firms. So it equates well for us as we start thinking about future growth potential. Larry Solow : And just on the foot on the Contract Manufacturing piece. I realize, I guess, some of that's still sort of overhead capacity absorption. Just any other more color there obviously it sounded like these global initiatives I assume will help Contract Manufacturing as well a little bit. We're just such strong growth top line this year I would figure maybe the gross profit margin would have moved a little bit higher. Any color on that? Bernard Birkett : Yeah, what we're seeing with that is that, just if we look at the products and sales we are seeing a margin expansion in line with our expectations. I think in the first quarter, as we commented earlier it's down to product mix. And we did have a lot of tooling costs, our tooling sales and engineering sales and they typically have a much lower-margin profile. So that impacted the gross margin percentage within the quarter. But when we look out for the remainder of 2019 and beyond we would expect to see incremental improvements in gross margin within contract. Larry Solow : Okay great. And then just lastly, Eric you mentioned sort of it seems like somewhat of an acceleration in some strategic agreements across lot of your platforms. Maybe a little bit more color on that. Maybe update on SmartDose and CZ? Eric Green : Yeah. No absolutely Larry. What's -- it's exciting we're seeing a -- look we have more work to do with our clients and our customers. But we have a number of -- in the double-digits of feasibility and development agreements with specific customers around SmartDose. And we obviously had discussions with several more. Some of our customers are making that public, but we tend not to discuss the details in great detail. So, we're feeling more comfortable as we start thinking about the potential of SmartDose. But I would say like we experienced with the path it's a long journey to get it to over the line and get it as a combination device in the market. Now what's encouraging on top of that is, not just in the biologics space we're seeing the interest level increase in our generics space. So, and that takes me over to the SelfDose. We have three distinct customers that are going into commercial launches with SelfDose. This is that, our unique product in the auto-injector space that is gaining traction for the dosing with multiple molecules. The last thing I'll comment is on CZ. We obviously use CZ for the SmartDose component. But what's also encouraging, we've been working for quite a while with a couple of customers on one mL Insert Needle. And we're looking at commercialization later on in 2019 early 2020. So as you think about these development agreements they take time to development and work through but, it's very encouraging and the quality of these agreements are strengthening also. Larry Solow : Okay. And then just lastly I might add you had a really great start to the year and obviously have realized some of the year-over-year increases were due to a little bit of a better easy comp compared to Q1 2018. But just, what's some of the initiatives going on? And sort of your guidance sort of implies like a 50bps-ish decline in operating margin from the Q1 level. Might there be a sense of conservatism in that? Or how should I sort of connect those dots? Bernard Birkett : Yeah. Again we've got a lot of initiatives going on of focus, but we have to be really focused and disciplined in our approach. And the key thing for us is to execute on the guidance that we've put out there and that's foremost in our minds. And that's why we want to make sure that it's the first quarter and it's been a really positive start. And we will make sure that traction continues as we move through 2019. Larry Solow : Fair enough, great. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open. John Kreger : Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to ask another question on the margin outlook for Contract Manufacturing. Bern you said you expect it to improve sequentially, do you expect for the whole year to have an improvement in gross margin or should we still assume it's down year-over-year for the full year? Bernard Birkett : No, we would expect to have an improvement -- an overall improvement year-over-year as we move through 2019. And we -- there are a number of initiatives underway; there is a lot of focus within that area because we realize that we want to capitalize on the revenue growth and we know we have to improve the margins within that business. And we've seen this take place in the proprietary business, so if you look over the last four quarters, we've seen margin improve in that area. And now our focus is on improving within Contract Manufacturing to make sure that we capitalize on the total revenue growth that the business has seen. John Kreger : Great. Thank you. A question about the geographic mix. What sort of growth differentials do you expect across regions based upon your pipeline at this point? And does that have a mix impact on margins? Eric Green : I'll start with this Bernard. When we look at the growth in the first part of the year, it's pretty even when you think about the Americas and Europe. It's close to the double-digits. In Asia as you know it's a smaller piece of our overall business. Overall, we're looking at for the full year about double digits as we have done the last couple of years. And that we're actually more excited now with South Korea onboard and it will be able to generate more revenue growth in that particular market. But as we go forward it's relatively a consistent growth across the three regions. What's interesting is when you think about generics it's a healthy growth in both the Americas and Europe and obviously biologics that's more right now it's heavily in the U.S. markets as we speak. So, that's kind of the mix that you would see. But we're not seeing much of a difference at this point in time in the different geographies. John Kreger : Great. Thank you. And then just one last one. Are you able to tell us what impact of Vial2Bag recall and your remediation efforts for that had on Q1 EBIT margin? Bernard Birkett : Yes, cost-wise, we probably picked up $2 million to $3 million in incremental cost within our SG&A line. We did look at and have some inventory obsolescence accrued for within COGS and that ranges at about just over $4 million and that -- and then we had some other one-time as we -- just in case people start to backing that out at the COGS number and extrapolating into margin we had some one-time revenues that came in from agreements that we have in place around our SmartDose device. So, that kind of offset the obsolescence charge. John Kreger : Great. Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik DeBruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Juan Avendano : Hi, this is Juan on behalf of Derik. Congratulations on the quarter. My first question is on research and development. Total R&D spend as a percentage of sales has come down slightly it's been down about by 10 basis points year-over-year over the last couple of years. Can you tell us about your outlook on R&D spend going forward? If you see R&D spend continuing to decline as a percentage of sales going forward? And how do you see all about this level of R&D spend and your ability to continue to innovate on high-value products and self-injection devices? Eric Green : Yes, Juan it's a great question and thank you for dialing in this morning. We -- when we take a look at R&D, I would like to first isolate against proprietary as CM is growing much faster than rest of the business. I think as a percentage of sales you're right it's somewhat flat may be slightly down. What we are seeing though is that there's a significant amount of resources within our R&D team that are focused on these development agreements for our customers. In particular it's not just in devices, but it's also in some of our elastomer components that we're designing for -- on behalf of specific customer. So when you think about that and that's actually on the rise and that we capture that in our COGS or cost of goods sold and -- to obviously get revenue to offset that. So if we look at that in the totality, it's probably relatively neutral slightly up as far as expense as a percentage of sales come out of our R&D group. Now it's a great question about the future, making sure that we are seeding the future portfolio, we continuously evaluate how we're going to use leverage R&D and look at, is there opportunities to put more resources particularly in our core part of our business. And that's an ongoing review, Juan and we will continue to feed it if there's opportunity for future growth in new product. Juan Avendano : Okay, good. The Contract Manufacturing segment has grown low double digits in the last couple of years. And it has exceeded your guidance in both years started off being mid-single digit and then eventually high single digits, but it did exceed your guidance. And so I know that for this year, you're continuing to guide mid-single-digit growth for the whole year. How conservative is that and why can't the CMO segment continue to do low double-digit growth going forward? Especially after you realigned this business to do more health care business as opposed to consumer products? What is the new long-term growth target for this segment going forward? Eric Green : Yeah, Juan it's a good question. I think when we look at installed capacity, we're just looking at how as we're building components for our customers. The installed capacity and the ramp-up we have for this year and what we have on the order book gives us confidence to be solid in the mid-single. There's always upside I want to tell you what the upside, the upside is the diabetes market continues to I guess I would argue exceed expectations and the actually phenomenal impact it's having on patient health care. And so we -- and we play part of that, we're part of that not just from a device point of view, but also from an auto-injector. So -- and then a lot of it comes from our Contact Manufacturing, but we also benefit with some of the primary containment elastomer coming out of our proprietary business. So Juan you're correct that part of the diabetes market has been a little bit more aggressive than we anticipated I would say if we look back. We do have some pretty tough comps in the second half of this year and that's why we are seeing that as lot more mid single-digit. And as we go forward, we have deemphasized consumer product that's less than 10% of our revenue within Contract Manufacturing today and we'll continue to invest in the health care space. So I would say Juan it's a -- we're in a good situation but we need to continuously improve the margin and profitability of that unit that's our primary focus outside of -- making sure we deliver on time in the fall and high quality to our customers. But we got to get profitability and then we'll continue to expand as we see profitable business coming to the -- into West. Juan Avendano : Okay, got it. And one last one if I may. It's sort of a very different question. A lot of people don't focus on this. But when I look at your product sales by -- I mean your overall sales by product type, we barely talk about the standard packaging components; everyone just focuses on the high-value product. But I was looking at historical slides for standard packaging components. When I compare the slides that you typically would have noted with the bubbles and the gross margin associated by product type and the five-year CAGR associated with them, I've noticed that for standard packaging components, the size of the bubble has decreased significantly. The growth profile has gone from mid-single digits to about low single digits and the margin -- gross margin profile with standard packaging components has come down from a high 20s to below the CMO segment and so about mid-teens at best. And so given that this product category still accounts for over 30% of sales on a product basis, can you just give us an update on the standard of packaging components? Any loss to high value products and your outlook in this product category in the future? Eric Green : Yeah, Juan it's a good question. We look at standard products. Obviously it remains an important part of our portfolio because there are several molecules in the market that rely on that portfolio. I can tell you, our global operations initiative one area they are looking at is continuously driving cost out of the system, so we can continue to deliver the product -- high-quality product to our customers. Now, when you think about the conversion of existing products to high-value products with our customers, so standard to high-value products that is still going on, so when you think about a high-value product growth in strong double digits that's not just new product pipeline or just biologics. That's spread throughout all three of the market units. And so there is an element of conversion and therefore there is -- I will say it in a different way, there's a little bit of cannibalization of ourselves. But it's a good thing because we get better ASP and get better margin. When you look at the margins itself, we don't believe that it's declining as much as I think you were articulating there. It's relatively consistent I would say. You're right. We probably don't get a lot of price, additional price in that area, it\u2019s probably less -- it's less than 1%, it's still positive. But I would say it's -- we're really focused on driving cost and lean-out the system at this point in time. Juan Avendano : Okay, got it. And in that vein, I guess, can you give us an update on the market penetration rates of high-value products by customers and so pharma, biologics and generics and overall? What percent of volumes do they make up overall and across each customer category nowadays? Eric Green : Yes, so on the biologics space over 90% of our transactions are what we classify as high-value products and it's just the nature of the portfolio. When you think about the generics side -- and by the way, when we think about the pipeline feeding the pipeline, if it was -- we were doing Westar RU, if we're doing coating and then also the FluroTec coating and also maybe Envision, our focus from that point is moving them up to NovaPure. So there is a conversion within the high-value products, we're still focused on -- in biologics. In generics, it's roughly around 50% of the portfolio is high-value products and you can see that increase. The reason why is because of the AccelTRA program which is gaining a lot of attention from our customers and interest to convert over the next couple of years. So you'll see that shift from 50% to much higher over the next couple of years. And when you think about pharma that's probably a slower transition. It's roughly around 30% to 40% -- roughly 35% to 40% of pharma is in high-value products, but I wouldn't say the shift towards HVP will be faster than generics. Let's say it's probably just slower just for the nature of the product. Juan Avendano : And overall? Eric Green : Well again, overall it's 20% of the volume we produce out of our elastomer portfolio and it's 60% of the revenue in Q1. It's just to give you that 60% of proprietary sales and it's roughly around 20% of the units and that's -- I'm using Q1 as the proxy and it's relative -- slightly better than it was last year. Juan Avendano : All right. Thank you. I appreciate the update and I'll follow-up online with additional questions. Eric Green : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Quintin Lai for any closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks Jimmy.

I now turn the call over to West\u2019s CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin , and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another quarter of strong growth on both the top and bottom lines from strong sales gains across the organization. And as a result of efficiency initiatives, put in place by our global operations team. Our performance in Q2, has shown once again, our customers positive reaction to our market-led growth strategy, with two good quarters behind us, and given our confidence in the underlying strength in future growth of the business, we are increasing our sales and EPS guidance for the full year. Bernard will take you through the details of our updated guidance later in the call. Let\u2019s start with the specifics of our sales performance on Slide 4. Proprietary product sales grew by 7.5% in the quarter. Key to the growth strategy in this segment is customer adoption of our high-value products. These products offer higher levels of quality and productivity to our customers, seeking to meet the increase in regulations of the biopharmaceutical industry to improve their own manufacturing performance and to meet the demands of new molecules and therapies. High-value products make up more than 60% of our proprietary product sales and in Q2, organic sales of these products grew double-digits. Now let\u2019s take a look at the organic sales growth of our market units. Sales within our Biologics market unit grew strong double-digits. In Q2, we experienced and an impressive uptake of our NovaPure and Westar components. We continue to see growing interest from biologic customers for these types of product solutions, and this demand is coming from volume growth of existing drugs and from newly commercialized drug products. We also saw a good uptake of Crystal Zenith containment solutions and our SmartDose technology platform. CZ growth is coming from both commercially available drugs as well as from pre-commercial molecules. We continue to experience high levels of customer activity across our SmartDose device platform for drugs in all stages of development. Looking ahead, we anticipate full year double-digit growth for the Biologics market unit. The Generics market unit had a solid quarter with high-single digit growth, high-value products also performed well in this market unit growing by double-digits. This was led by an increased uptake of Westar RS and RU products. We are pleased with the continued interest and adoption of our elastomer components, including the AccelTRA product line. In addition, we\u2019re also seeing demand for our delivery and safety device platforms for use with generics medicines. We expect high-single digit growth in this market unit for the full year. Our pharma market unit experienced a small decline in the quarter due to the previously announced Vial2Bag product recall. If we\u2019d exclude this impact, we saw a mid-single digit growth for pharma, led by FluroTec and Envision product sales. We expect the pharma market units to deliver full-year performance of low single-digit growth. A quick word about the Vial2Bag, as we noted on our last call, we remain committed to bringing this product back to the market. We are working to redesign certain aspects of the device, with the goal of returning to the market with enhanced product for hospitals and the patients they are treating. Let\u2019s now turn to Contract Manufacturing. The segment of our business, once again posted strong sales of 10% over the prior year\u2019s quarter. The majority of the growth continues to be in the diabetes market, led by sales of medical and drug delivery devices, and services. For the balance of the year, we expect that quarterly sales will be in line with the performance of the segment in Q1 and Q2 of this year, but that growth will moderate as this business runs up against more difficult year-over-year comparisons. We anticipate full year growth of high-single digits in Contract Manufacturing. I\u2019d like to now review some business highlights from the quarter on Slide 5. We discussed at our last quarterly earnings update, the importance of expanding our Company\u2019s reach to help us grow in the important Asia-Pacific region. We have established a direct presence in the very attractive South Korean market, through the acquisition of our distributor. Another example comes from our China team who recently hosted more than 200 customers from 70 companies for our West sponsored educational event reinforcing the technical expertise we can bring to our customers in this market. Our scientific and technical team continues to be at the forefront of the industry, presenting at numerous conferences, publishing their work in partnering with our customers to shape best practice in our field. We\u2019re also pleased to announce that our NovaGuard Safety system recently won two India Packaging Awards for Excellence. This product is designed to help prevent accidental needle stick injuries, which is a serious concern for healthcare practitioners and their patients. Customers recognize the value of this product and as a result, we are seeing increased uptake. As our commercial team works with customers to provide solutions for their most demanding injectable containment and delivery needs, our operations team is working to help our business work more efficiently. They are driving for improve safety, higher quality, better service and increase profitability. We have implemented a number of lean initiatives across the organization through our One West management system that are really starting to pay off. I recently visited our plants in Europe, and saw firsthand the improvements that team has made to streamline internal processes, improve quality standards and address customer feedback more effectively. Customers are knows into and have provided us with very positive feedback at the conclusion of several recent audits. We\u2019re also working to consolidate and optimize our global manufacturing network. By the end of the year, we will have 25 plants, a total reduction of four sites over the past two years. This broad restructuring program announced in Q1 of 2018 is on track to be completed by year-end and will provide significant savings for our business in the future. As a result of these efforts, and the growth of our high-value product portfolio, we achieved more than 180 basis points of consolidated gross profit margin expansion in the quarter. Thanks to margin improvements in both our Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing segments. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett to go into more detail around our financial performance. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everybody. So let\u2019s review the numbers in more detail. We\u2019ll first look at Q2 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw a continued solid growth led by strong Proprietary Products performance especially in our Biologics market unit. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter and how we see it continuing to improve in 2019. In addition to some quarter end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we\u2019ll review the guidance for 2019. First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6 and the reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 11 to 15. We recorded net sales of $469.7 million, representing organic sales growth of 8.1% and 20 basis points of inorganic growth related to a recent acquisition. We also saw growth in two of our proprietary product market units and in Contract Manufacturing with double-digit organic sales growth in our Biologics market unit. We are pleased to see continued improvement in gross profit. We recorded $157.9 million in gross profit, $15.7 million or 11% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 33.6% was 180 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We also saw improvements in adjusted operating profit with $81.9 million recorded this quarter, compared to $62.5 million in the same period last year for a 31% increase. And our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.4% was a 340 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 27%. So what\u2019s driving the growth in both revenue and profit. On Slide 7, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $33.9 million or 7.6 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.4 million or 0.7 percentage points of the growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $15.1 million or a reduction of 3.4 percentage points. Looking at margin performance, Slide 8 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 33.6% for Q2 2019, up from 31.8% in Q2 2018. Proprietary Products second quarter gross profit margin of 39.5% was 230 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, focusing on high-value product, sales price increases and increasing plant efficiency and utilization, partially offset by increased labor costs and the impact of the voluntary recall of Vial2Bag products. Our high-value products represented 62% of Q2 Proprietary Product sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% increased by 120 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in margin is primarily due to improved production efficiencies. Adjusted operating profit margin grew by 340 basis points over Q2 2018, as we continue to expand gross profit margin and closely manage our operating expenses as we execute on our 2019 goals. Now let\u2019s look at our balance sheet and review how we\u2019ve done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 9, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $152.7 million for the year-to-date 2019, an increase of $25.7 million, compared to the same period in 2018 a 20% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $57.1 million, $8.9 million higher than a year ago. Working capital of $631.1 million at June 30, 2019 was $20.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in our accounts receivable and inventory balances. Our cash balance at June 30th of $326.7 million was $10.7 million less than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to an increase in the cost for purchases of our common stock in 2019 and the acquisition of our distributor in South Korea. Turning to guidance. Slide 10 provides a high level summary. First despite increasing FX headwinds, we are raising our expectation of 2019 full year, net sales to be in a range of between $1.81 billion and $1.825 billion compared to the prior guidance range of between $1.79 billion and $1.82 billion. We expect organic sales growth to be at the higher end of the previously communicated range of 6% to 8% over 2018, reported net sales, which assumes a headwind of $42 million for the full year 2019 sales based on current foreign currency exchange rates, compared to the prior guidance of a full year negative impact of between $34 to $37 million. Second, we are raising both bottom and top end of our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.20. Our new range for the full year 2019 adjusted diluted EPS will be $3 and $3.10, compared to the prior guidance of between $2.80 and $2.90. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as we \u2013 as you review our guidance. At this point, guidance does not include any revenues for Vial2Bag in 2019 and forecasted costs of remediation are included in our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.10 on adjusted diluted EPS based on foreign currency exchange rates, compared to the prior guidance of $0.08. To summarize the key takeaways for the quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS over Q2 2018 and growth year-to-date in operating and free cash flow. Organic sales and EPS projections for 2019 and performance to date are in line with our long-term construct of 6% to 8% organic sales growth, operating profit margin improvement of greater than 100 basis points and EPS expansion. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize, our Q2 performance together with the results we saw in Q1 have contributed to a very strong start to the year. As we look to the remainder of 2019, we know that our market-led growth strategy will continue to drive value for our stakeholders. We have the top experts in our field working at West and that technical and scientific expertise is an asset to our customers. Across all market units, customers are driving demand for our high-value products, and we are delivering those products and solutions with a more efficient and cost-effective manufacturing initiatives. This is translating into better margins and increased return on invested capital. We feel confident in the continued strength of our business and look forward to a successful remainder of 2019. Chris, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open. John Kreger : Hi. Thanks very much. Could you just give us a little bit more info on the acquisition, and should we be thinking about acquisitions perhaps is a little bit more active part of your capital deployment strategy going forward? Eric Green : John, good morning. When we look at the acquisition in South Korea, it\u2019s really a key strategy to have a direct presence, and what I would call it a very attractive biopharma marketplace that we historically work with the dealer. And one of West\u2019s strengths is to have that direct interaction with our clients across the globe. So we believe that is an opportunity to step-in directly and actually reinforce our focus in the Asia-Pacific market. Looking forward to other types of M&A transactions, we feel that we\u2019ll continuously look at bolt-on technologies that will enhance our current portfolio, but also look at ways to \u2013 look at adjacent spaces to really continue to support our existing customer base. John Kreger : Great, thanks. And then also just to clarify, I think a comment you made earlier on the call that you think of pharma growth will be low-single digits for the year, I assume that is burdened with the Vial2Bag recall? Eric Green : Yes, John. It\u2019s correct. It does that low single-digit does include the Vial2Bag recall that occurred last year. John Kreger : Great, great. And then lastly, any sense about when you think you can re-launch that product, is that something that could be feasible for next year? Eric Green : Well, we have guided this year\u2019s revenues without any Vial2Bag revenues. And again, we are working towards the resolution and will be working with the regulatory authorities to get it back as soon as possible. So until we have affirmation from the regulatory bodies, we can\u2019t comment on exactly when this will be returning. John Kreger : Okay. Thank you. Eric Green : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. And if your phone is on mute, Paul please unmute it. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. Congratulations on the quarter. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Paul and good morning. Paul Knight : Can you talk to demand? Is it coming from the record number of approvals last year or is it \u2013 and the second question is, in the cell and gene therapy, there\u2019s obviously a lot of things in the pipeline. Is that a significant part of your business, your containment systems on the cell and gene side. And I guess, the first question though is, are you seeing this approved therapy in total from last year. Is that part of what we\u2019re seeing in this growth rate? Eric Green : Yes, Paul, if \u2013 when you think about the growth rate we have today and looking at the committed order book that we have in the near-term, that really is due to the robust pipeline that\u2019s coming through. In addition to that, it\u2019s uptake of molecules have been introduced in the market a couple of years ago. So it\u2019s a combination of existing molecules, but also new launches over the last 12 to 18 months. On the cell and gene therapy here, it\u2019s too early to comment. A lot of that is in early phase as you know. We obviously have a role to play in the containment of the very important therapies, but the volumes will be small. And \u2013 but it\u2019s too early to tell. It\u2019s not \u2013 that is not impacting our numbers as of today. Paul Knight : And then secondly, Bernard, I noticed obviously operating cash flow up 20% and free cash up 21%. I guess, you\u2019re still in the early days of your improvement of capital and management of capital, facility consolidation. I mean, is this a couple of year process ahead of us, where we\u2019ll see better utilization, turnover on cash and facility utilization. Could you talk to us about that overall program that you\u2019ve embarked upon and where \u2013 how long it goes? Bernard Birkett : Yes. It\u2019s a multi-year process, and we will be continuously looking for improvements in operating and free cash flow generation, and it is a big focus for the organization across a number of different areas. So it\u2019s not just on CapEx, it\u2019s across all aspects of our business. As we believe, it is very important for us, obviously, to focus on that. So again, we have a lot of people looking at it in different areas and we\u2019re very focused on cash flow generation and disciplined in our approach. And that... Paul Knight : What do you think your maintenance capital expenditure is? Bernard Birkett : It\u2019s probably between $40 million to $50 million a year. Paul Knight : Okay, thank you. Eric Green : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Windley : Thanks. Quick follow-up on that last question. Bernard has the maintenance number, is that something you\u2019ve been able to compress or has that been fairly stable and it\u2019s been the growth capital that you\u2019ve compressed? Bernard Birkett : It\u2019s been \u2013 we haven\u2019t compressed a lot of growth capital. I think, if you look back at the way we were spending before we were investing a lot in facilities and that expanded the CapEx. So the focus is on utilizing and improving the utilization of what we have, the infrastructure that we have in place. We believe we have a lot of capacity, the maintenance CapEx has been pretty stable over the last number of years. But just to be clear, we\u2019re not impacting growth, we are investing in growth on a continuous basis and that\u2019s where we invest a lot of our capital and that\u2019s where the allocation goal. So it\u2019s a very, very measured approach, but the difference being that we do not have to invest in large building projects at this current time. David Windley : Yes, great. Good clarification. And my question was an intend to do imply that you were sacrificing growth at all. But just where the decline in the budget was coming from? A kind of a similar theme, as you are seeing some nice operating margin \u2013 gross margin, operating margin improvement in the quarter, is that in any way, driven by the facility rationalization that you\u2019re doing. Is that showing up already or are those facilities not yet offline, and so that\u2019s actually still in front of us? Bernard Birkett : Yes, that\u2019s still in front of us. Again, it will be over the next number of years. Beginning in 2020, we\u2019ll start to see the benefits of the rationalizations coming through. So the drivers right now is, we\u2019ve seen a lot of HVP growth, which is a key strategy for us and we expect to see that continuing, and that\u2019s been supplemented by the improvements in overall utilization and productivity gains that we\u2019ve been seeing coming through our plans with the implementation of lean initiatives and globalization of operations. And the important aspect that we saw, again in this quarter, was the improvement in margins in Contract Manufacturing. And that\u2019s also been a plus and now that\u2019s back on track. So there are a number of drivers for overall operating margin expansion. David Windley : And on your comment on Contract Manufacturing, did improve year-over-year. I think the second quarter of last year was kind of the low point? Bernard Birkett : Yes. David Windley : Is that now on a fairly steep improving trajectory or I think the highs for that business are still 700 basis points above the 2Q levels that you just achieved. How could you might describe the trajectory to those prior levels? Bernard Birkett : That\u2019s correct. So, we would expect to see the continuous improvements for the remainder of the year and improvement into 2020. As we get back to 2016, 2017 levels of gross margin within that business. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to happen overnight, but we have made some changes within our contract manufacturing business. We\u2019re taking a lot of the learning\u2019s that we\u2019ve had within our Proprietary Business from an operational point of view and applying those within our Contract Manufacturing division and we\u2019re starting to see the improvements come through there, but it\u2019s not an overnight fix and it will take a little bit of time. So you\u2019ll see a phased in, but there will be continuous and sustained improvement. David Windley : Great, thanks. And last question, Eric, this one, I may be able to bring you in on this one. The \u2013 your generic clients are buying up into high-value products that\u2019s been, I think one of the kind of pleasant surprises of your kind of segmentation at the end market from when you joined to CEO. Some of those clients are under some, \u2013 what seems to be a little bit of financial duress, at this point, some stocks trading, it\u2019s a really, really low prices. Is there a way \u2013 do you think that of impacts demand for your products at all? And is there a way for you to protect yourself or diversify yourself in the event that maybe one of these, presuming it\u2019s not all of them, but one might be more negatively financially impacted? Eric Green : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. And to your point is that we are diversified within the generic space. So we continuously work with the broad array of the generic players today. I would say we\u2019re in early stages as we move our generic customers from standard packaging components to the high-value products by leveraging the recently launched AccelTRA program. We think about the adoption rates with our clients, it takes one-to-two years to get the adoption and to have them retool their operations, which frankly, at the end of the day is taking cost out of their system, even though they\u2019re moving up the high-value products and ASPs slightly higher. So we\u2019re supporting them by bringing better prior to the market, driving better yield of their manufacturing in final fill finish, and given the assurance that this total cost of ownership, cost continues to drive down their overall cost. I would say summarize though we are \u2013 we do diversify, and if there is a issue with one client, we typically see that particular drug molecule to be picked up by another. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good situation with our diversity. David Windley : Okay, great. Thank you. Eric Green : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Juan Avendano : Hi. This is Juan Avendano for Derik. Congratulations on the quarter, guys. Eric Green : Yes. Thank you, Juan. Juan Avendano : My first question is, can you give us your thoughts on the 4 plus 7 generic program in China. Have you evaluated the situation and is any potential impact from this fully embedded in the revised 2019 guidance? Also if you could tell us what your revenue exposure is through the Chinese generics market? Eric Green : Well, Juan, when you look at our revised guidance. This is not being driven by China. So either way, we have a \u2013 our business in Asia Pacific is roughly \u2013 last year is about 8% of total West and China is a portion of that. Obviously, a larger localities are China, India and Japan, and also in Southeast Asia. But the 4 plus 7 we refer to the Chinese \u2013 in the market, that does not impact our current business and we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure to the local generics. Our growth in that market and where we\u2019re seeing the growth and we\u2019re investing, is really the multinationals they\u2019re pulling us into the market for them to be able to manufacture into either use the local consumption or export. The two areas that we\u2019ve seen most of the growth in is in the pharma and biologic, very less so in the generic space out of China. Juan Avendano : Okay, good. Thanks. And then my second question is, for the full year 2019, you still expect the pharma business to post low single-digit organic growth. I think that in order to achieve this, I estimate the pharma growth would need to be at least in the high single-digits in 4Q given that in the next quarter of the prior year a comp is difficult. And so what gives you confidence in the strong rebound in the pharma business in the fourth quarter and what is the downside risk to this? Bernard Birkett : So if you look at that from a comp perspective, we had a large credit in the fourth quarter of 2018 regarding the Vial2Bag recall. So, that adjustment in Q4 2018 within the pharma sector. So when you comp it from the growth perspective that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to see the high single-digit growth within this year within Q4... Eric Green : Within pharma. Bernard Birkett : ...within pharma. Juan Avendano : Okay. All right. Good. And then my last question if I may. One of the phrases in the press release that I\u2019ve piqued my interest towards that one of the reasons why you are raising guidance for the full year in 2019. Was that you are encouraged by the growing backlog of committed orders. You used to provide this number on a quarterly basis before, but over the last year, you have only provided annually. I was wondering, if you could tell us what that backlog is the absolute dollar value of if it\u2019s less than $0.5 billion. What was that \u2013 what was it year-to-date as of the second quarter? Bernard Birkett : Well, instead of calling out that the exact number what we\u2019re seeing is a large growth in the our order book compared to the same time last year. So we\u2019re seeing the order book strengthened as and that\u2019s been happening as we\u2019ve been going through the year. So it hasn\u2019t just all happened at once, and that gives us confidence and to be able to use that a support for raising the guidance. So that we\u2019re seeing strong fundamental growth in the market. Juan Avendano : Okay. That was it. Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thanks, Juan. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Great. Thanks, guys, and congratulations on a really good quarter and very impressed on the margin side. Just a few summary questions and most of them have been answered, but on the \u2013 on sort of I guess related to the backlog. I know you guys obviously improved your throughput significantly in the last few years and that it skewed backlog as lead times to came down a lot. Part of our thesis was that as supply really start to improve and overall \u2013 eventually, you would start seeing some legacy products, start transitioning to some of your higher value products. And Eric, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks there that you are seeing some \u2013 part of the growth this quarter was sort of on existing products, not only on new and improved products. So are you seeing sort of maybe not inflection point, but older pharmaceutical and older products starting to transition or at least move up the chain in the high-value products area? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, the \u2013 we look at our \u2013 the order book, the committed orders that we have on hand today as Bernard mentioned a little bit earlier, is that we\u2019re seeing a very healthy uptake. And the driver of that, I would say, two or three years ago, we were spent a lot of time talking about lead times from our operations. Today, that increase in demand is not due to lead times in our operations. I am very convinced the when we globalized the operations and the focus that we have, and the lead initiatives there in our operations is really driving quality, is driving delivery and service to our customers. So if you spoke to our customers, you\u2019ll hear quickly that there hasn\u2019t been any really change of the really improved performance we\u2019ve seen over the last one or two years. The demand that we\u2019re seeing at this point really is \u2013 mostly a combination of volume of existing drugs in the marketplace and new product launches that are \u2013 have been planned and will be planned in the near future. I\u2019m very encouraged by this, because this is not just in one of the segments. This is across all segments and this is showing us the underlying health of the different markets we serve. Obviously biologics has a healthier market growth rate than the small molecules and pharma, but when I see the growth that we\u2019re seeing, to me, it shows that we\u2019re maintaining share, if not capturing new share with new products going through the pipeline. Larry Solow : All right. And it seems like you\u2019re also now is your mix of high-value products rising, but within that mix, because I know, like NovaPure is, it sounds like it\u2019s starting to really pick up some steam, but I eventually guess, it\u2019s still represents a pretty small fraction of overall in terms of penetration of that relative to other high-value products. Is that fair to say? Eric Green : Right. If we, if we look at two areas that you one of them you spoke that was NovaPure. We\u2019ve talked about that in the past, but the adoption is now get into commercial drug molecules in the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing the same thing with the Crystal Zenith. And so now it\u2019s becoming more meaningful these numbers and the growth is quite significant. So while we don\u2019t give out specific numbers of each product line. Those two areas alone are contributing to a good portion of the growth, in particularly in the biologics area and helps a little bit in the CZ side, also helps out with the pharma side. Larry Solow : And that also lead into my next question. Could you without quantifying maybe give us a little more color on the CZ side? Maybe how many new primary products you have commercialized today or something changed from the last couple of years or any more color there would be great. Eric Green : Yes, what you\u2019ve seen on the CZ side is that we\u2019re \u2013 and the commercial number of products is about three are being launched in 2019. So that\u2019s incremental and particularly around the 1 ml insert needle that we are manufacturing in our Scottsdale, Arizona facility. This is obviously great work done by both our partner Daikyo and also our internal engineers will get into the scale up as our customers and I won\u2019t mention specifically of our customers are increasing their demand and for these launches, is also causing this as Bernard talked earlier about where are we invest in our capital. That\u2019s a specific area where we\u2019re investing in additional capital not facilities, but actual line, cell lines to build and produce more Crystal Zenith 1 ml insert needle and also frankly in the NovaPure line too. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the uptick Larry, we\u2019re seeing it and now in sort of really pre-commercial and development. These are starting to take off very encouraged by it. Larry Solow : Excellent. And then just last question just miscellaneous one for Bernard, on the, there was the $2.5 million credit, I guess, in the operating income line. What\u2019s that related to? Bernard Birkett : FX. Larry Solow : It is an FX. Okay, great. Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Larry. Larry Solow : Thank you. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any further remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Chris. And thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s conference call.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's press release.I'll now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin. And good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today.As you saw in our press release, we delivered another solid quarter. We continue to make excellent progress implementing our market-led strategy, creating value for our customers and the patients we serve together. Our performance demonstrates the forward momentum we have seen throughout the year on a number of fronts.The market units are driving growth through differentiated value propositions. Our investments in newly launched products and services are gaining traction and contributing to robust high-value product growth. The globalization of our operations is driving improvements around quality, service, and productivity gains and we have increased our investment in Daikyo Seiko to deepen this long-term strategic partnership.With three good quarters behind us, and given our confidence in the underlying strength and future growth of the business, we are increasing our sales and EPS guidance for the full year. Bernard will take you through the details of our updated guidance later in the call.Let's start with an overview of our sales performance on Slide 4. Proprietary product sales grew organically by 8.5% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of proprietary product sales grew double-digits and continue the momentum that we have seen throughout 2019.Turning to the market units, sales within our Biologics market unit once again grew strong double digits. During the quarter, Biologics saw increased demand from both large and small biotech customers. This demand has been fueled by customers selecting NovaPure for the New Drug Applications.This is now paying dividends, as many of these drugs have been approved and launched in the past year. Our NovaPure sales which have grown strong double digits for three consecutive quarters in 2019, reflect post approval reorders and the commercial success of our customers' products.Crystal Zenith is a similar story. Volume has grown for CZ containers and syringes for the use with newly-approved drugs and for development agreements to support pre-commercial activity. Additionally, we have experienced good uptake and Daikyo and Flurotec components, a trend we see continuing.Looking ahead, we anticipate full-year double-digit growth for the biologics market unit. The generics market unit grew mid-single digits, high-value product sales led the growth and we continue to set the stage for future growth with the AccelTRA component program. Our early interest customers are moving from the evaluation phase to the contract phase preparing for commercialization of their drugs with this unique containment platform.As we have said on prior calls, we're also seeing interest from generic customers in our self-injection platforms and CZ. A recent capacity investment for self-dose will enable further acceleration of this growth.We expect high single-digit growth for the generics market unit for the full year. Our Pharma market unit experienced a mid-single-digit decline in sales in the quarter primarily due to the previously announced Vial2Bag product recall.However, we are encouraged that we continue to see high value product adoption for our Pharma customers and are working to support them as they convert legacy products to higher value offerings such as Envision inspection.We expect the Pharma market unit to return to growth in the fourth quarter and deliver full-year performance of low single-digit growth. Our book of committed orders in the Proprietary Product segment continues to be healthy giving us confidence, that our growth can be sustained.Let's now turn to Contract Manufacturing, this segment of our business posted organic sales growth of 6%. The primary growth driver continues to be in the diabetes market led by sales of a diagnostic and drug delivery devices.As we have discussed on prior calls, contract manufacturing growth is moderating, especially as it comes against a strong second half performance comp from 2018. We expect further moderation in Q4 and continue to expect full year 2019 growth to be in the high single digits.Turning to Slide 5, we recently made two announcements that demonstrate our continued progress to support the unique needs of the markets we serve. Earlier this week, at the PDA conference, Pre-filled Syringe in Sweden, we introduced a new high-value product and highlighted our self-injection portfolio. We launched our NovaPure 3 mL cartridge components, which are specifically designed for use with higher volume drug delivery devices.These components solved an unmet need in the market. Given the increase in sensitive biologic products that are being developed, these drugs often delivered through an autoinjector or on-body injector require the highest quality cartridge components and this new offering from West meets that challenge.We also highlighted our SmartDose Gen II injector, which enables subcu delivery of injectable therapy is up to 10 ML in volume. The increase in customer development agreements for smart dose and across our self-injection platform demonstrates the commercial success we have seen with these technologies and the future growth potential they represent for West.Last week, we also announced that we increased our minority stake in Daikyo to 49%. For over four decades, Daikyo and West are partnered together to bring high quality, reliable, and innovative drug containment solutions to our customers. Our increased investment demonstrates our long-term commitment to the strategic partnership and we look forward to our continued collaborations for years to come.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, to go into more detail around our financial performance. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning everybody.Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw continued solid growth led by strong proprietary products performance especially in our Biologics market unit. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter in addition to some quarter end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review the guidance for 2019.First up Q3, our financial results are summarized on Slide 6 and the reconciliation of non-US GAAP measures are described in Slide 11 to 15. We recorded net sales of $456.1 million representing organic sales growth of 7.9% and 20 basis points of inorganic growth related to a recent acquisition.We also saw growth in two of our proprietary product market units and in contract manufacturing with double-digit organic sales growth in our Biologics market unit. We are pleased to see continued improvement in gross profits.We recorded $147.8 million in gross profit, $12.2 million or 9% above Q3 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 32.4% was 100 basis points expansion from the same period last year. We also saw improvement in adjusted operating profits with $70.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $63.1 million in the same period last year for an 11% increase.And our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.4% was an 80 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% and approximately 12% when stock based compensation tax benefit is excluded.So what's driving growth in both revenue and profit. On slide 7, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $32.2 million or 7.5 percentage points of the growth.Sales price increase is contributed $2.8 million or 0.7 percentage points of the growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $10.6 million or a reduction of 2.5 percentage points.Looking at margin performance, Slide 8 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.4% for Q3 2019, up from 31.4% in Q3 2018. Proprietary Products' third quarter gross profit margin of 38.2% was 120 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2018.The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold focusing on high-value products, production efficiencies, and sales price increases partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products and devices represented 63% of Q3 proprietary product sales, and generate a double-digit organic sales growth.Contract Manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 14.4% increased by 10 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin grew by 80 basis points over Q3 2018, as we continue to expand gross profit margins and closely manage SG&A and R&D expenses. We did see a period headwind on other income and expense due to an FX impact.Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 9, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $260.8 million year-to-date 2019, an increase of $45.4 million compared to the same period in 2018 at 21% increase.Our year-to-date capital spending was $88.8 million, $14.1 million higher than a year ago and in line with our expectations. Working capital of $669.1 million at September 30, 2019 was $58.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance at September 30th of $396 million was $58.6 million more than our December 2018 balance, a 17% increase.Turning to guidance, Slide 10 provides a high-level summary. First, despite increase in FX headwinds, we are raising our expectation of 2019 full year net sales to be in a range of between $1.815 billion and $1.825 billion.We expect organic sales rate grows to be approximately 8% over 2018 reported net sales, which assumes a headwind of $54 million for the full year 2019 sales based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of a full year negative impact of $42 million.Second, we are raising our 2019 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of between $3.10 and $3.15 compared to the prior guidance of between $3 and $3.10. CapEx guidance remains at $120 million to $130 million.There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to, as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.13 on adjusted diluted EPS based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of $0.10. We have seen an impact of approximately $0.11 for the first nine months of the year.From a comp perspective, SG&A expense in Q4 2018 was unusually low due to adjustments to compensation accruals made around the impacts of to back recall. The SG&A expense Q4 2019 is expected to be more in line with the spend patterns experienced throughout 2019.So, to summarize the key takeaways for the quarter strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit improvements, growth in adjusted operating profit margin, growth and adjusted diluted EPS over Q3 '18 and growth year-to-date in operating and free cash flow.Our raised sales and EPS projections for 2019 and performance to date are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth. Operating profit margin of improvement of greater than 100 basis points and EPS expansion.I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard.Before we open the line for questions, I want to conclude with a few key takeaways. Across our business segments, customers are driving demand for our products and services. Our R&D investments have resulted in new product launches that will contribute to our future high value product growth and our global operations team is driving efficient and cost-effective manufacturing initiatives to ensure we continue to deliver margin expansion and increased return on invested capital.With another solid performance this quarter, we're poised to finish out the year strong and we're confident in the opportunities we see ahead of us. Kevin, we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight with Janney. Unidentified Analyst : It's actually Mike on for Paul. Congratulations on the quarter. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Mike, good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Eric, can you talk through the highlights in the Proprietary Product portfolio this quarter, specifically around Biologics. And then additionally, can you give an update on CZ and has it really become meaningful to your numbers yet or is that more in 2020? Thank you. Eric Green : Yes. Thank you, Mike. When you look at the Biologics business, we continue to grow very strong in this area, it's a combination of new products being launched into the marketplace, but also reorders of previously launched products and being actually adopted into the marketplace. So we're very confident with the performance this year and we see a very strong committed order book for this particular area.And when you start thinking about the pipeline of new molecules being approved and our participation and, in this space, we continue to be extremely high. So I'm very confident as we look forward. In particular, in the second question, it was in regards to CZ actually interesting part about that part of our portfolio.I would see a lot of it is around Biologics, we had two approvals in Q3 again two Biologics and that would make it for the year five approvals, and if you recall the previous years, we had significantly less than that.So we're seeing gain momentum with CZ mostly in the syringe area, we're continuing to invest in the Scottsdale, Arizona facility to handle the demand that's being requested by our customers and we also had a one vial approval earlier this year. The CZ cartridges are also driving nicely due to the SmartDose demand that we have with both the active DAS and also active feasibility studies underway. Unidentified Analyst : And then maybe for Bernard. Can you provide some color on the outlook for CapEx spend? It's come down significantly from your peak of $170 million in 2016 to about just under $120 million, as we look forward, is there room for continued reduction in that number. And then maybe, Eric can chime in too, but as visibility demand increases, as you guys talk on the call, how do you think about volume increasing as we work towards a smaller footprint? Thank you and I'll hop back in the queue. Bernard Birkett : Yes. So on the CapEx, we were focusing on really is growth - our investment in automation and growth and obviously there is always a certain level of maintenance CapEx, which is about $45 million. No, typically for the last year or two, we've been running at about 6% to 7% of revenues for CapEx spend and that's what we would be targeting, but it's - we always have to make sure that we're investing the appropriate amounts, and the business to make sure that we can continue to drive the growth.But a lot of the investments on CapEx that are in more in equipment and automation, which provide faster returns on investments compared to investing in buildings and facilities so hopefully that covers it for you. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Larry Solow : Just a couple maybe, one of my high level questions, just on the Daikyo investment. Was there any reason for timing of that or was there some kind of option on that that was expiring or is that any thoughts on that would be great. Eric Green : Larry, the discussions with Daikyo and obviously, it's a very long a deep relationship we've had for quite a while and but it's very important between both companies because when you think about the technology and parts of their portfolio, how it supports our growth in high-value products and particularly around the Biologics space.So, we've been engaged in dialog and how we can continuously build a stronger relationship and partnership. There were no actions required due to previous agreements, but this increase from 25% to 49% does put us in a very good position with Daikyo as their exclusive partner both on a distribution of their existing products, but also the license and technology that we share between the two firms and that was a major thrust Larry to bring this forward and to reinforce the growth that we have in our high-value products and particularly in the Biologics space. Larry Solow : And then also on the - I know you at the SmartDose - I guess next generation SmartDose, which you guys have shown I think already to investors, just - obviously that's being now commercialized, can you just sort of highlight sort of the advantages of that over the prior product and if you can kind of help further adoption faster. Eric Green : Larry, what you're seeing there is that with the original first version that we came out with that was targeted towards smaller doses and particularly in the biologic space and what we're being asked by our customers, they want to take that technology and allow them to move certain molecules - drug molecules from IV infusion environment to a subcu. And so that - and these tend to be molecules that are in the market already.So, this is actually good news for West because the technology can handle larger volumes as we indicated with the, the launch of the 10 ML cartridge dose at this point of time and it allows us to support our customers through development driving from IV to subcu and we have several development agreements underway as we speak obviously, as in the past we don't talk about our the specific customers or the molecule itself, but there are many that we're currently working on. Larry Solow : And then just a couple for Bernard. On the restructuring I guess that's one particular program that's expect to save you guys $40 million annually, is that pretty much complete, did you start seeing some of those benefits and will you get that whole benefit or will some of that money be reinvested back into the business? Bernard Birkett : So it's - it will be completed by the end of Q4 and the vast majority of the work will be done and we'll start to see the benefits come through in 2020 on a phased basis. So, as we move through the year, we will be able to harvest more of those benefits. Larry Solow : And then just last question I joined the call little late, you may have addressed it. Just on the lower tax rate this quarter was that - was there an additional credit in there was that more related to the options, expenses? Bernard Birkett : More related to the options expenses and at this point, there were no other major adjustments to tax within the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger : The Daikyo ownership stake increased, did any other part of the relationship change other than the ownership stake? Eric Green : No, it's relatively the same as I've mentioned earlier, we do have exclusivity with Daikyo and between the distribution and license and technology agreements, but it was an increase in stake as the major change of the agreement. John Kreger : And then, I think in the press release you mentioned a small acquisition benefit, again, was that just the impact of the higher stake or was there some other deal that you guys did in the quarter? Eric Green : No. That was - actually that was - that is due to the transaction we had last quarter due to South Korea to acquire our distributors, so allows us to work directly with the end customers, which by the way has gone quite well. The integration has gone very smoothly and we've already seen the benefits with conversations with some of the largest biosimilar companies in that part of the world. John Kreger : And then, Eric, one more, maybe can you just talk a little bit more about how you view the pharma client segment, what do you think the key is to driving better growth as we kind of look out to '20 and beyond. Eric Green : Yes, John, the big driver there, the number one driver is continuing to convert large pharma customers from the standard products to high-value products. That's the number one thesis of the growth of that unit, the other when you thinking about total cost of ownership, so as we demonstrate to our clients that we're able to take cost out of the system and provide a higher quality, better cycle time to them allows them drive their inventories down in a better, cleaner product in the marketplace.The second one is in the, specifically in the diabetes application that continues to be robust. You see that in our contract manufacturing space. When you think about all those devices that we're producing for through contract manufacturing, it also requires primary containment, which is usually the less component specifically around the insulin portfolio. The pipeline is strong and we're feeling very comfortable.I think what you see with 2018 performance is the impact of Vial2Bag and as we work through that, you won't see that direct impact going forward, but more upside when we eventually get the product back in the marketplace. John Kreger : Any update on that recall of both in terms of timing, but also on what the expense burden was in the third quarter? Thank you. Eric Green : Yes. We're obviously still working through the process, so we don't have an update on the timeline for re-entry into the market at this point. On the expense side, you're looking at probably a couple of million dollars, so nothing too material. Operator : Our last question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : To follow-up on John's last question there, Bernard, could you quantify the revenue headwind from Vial2Bag. Bernard Birkett : It was in the quarter but I think about $4 million for the quarter. David Windley : $4 million for the quarter. Okay, great. Broader strategic question, in terms of capacity in so much as you've globalized your operation footprint. Bernard, you talked about investments in automation and things like that, I am interested in how you think about your runway for capacity by say, the end of this year when you've taken the targeted facilities offline, you've invested in automation, you have Waterford online, things like that.Are you - do you have room in your existing footprint to support growth for a fairly significant period of time and if you could put a timeline on that, that'd be great? Or should we be thinking about you're beginning to add modules to Waterford or expanding other facility locations in order to support growth. I'm just curious kind of where you - where will you stand with your capacity by the end of the year? Bernard Birkett : Well, at the end of the year, we have adequate capacity for a number of years, we believe with the obviously the existing footprint with the levels of automation, we're looking at and automation is a journey, it's not going to be completed in one or two years, it's a multi-year process. And so we don't see that we're going to have to add facilities for production in the coming years. David Windley : In terms of margin, you've been focused there, you've talked about certainly maybe starting with contract manufacturing, you've talked about kind of driving some more efficiency into staffing levels and things like that in the contract manufacturing business, the year-over-year kind of progression on margin slowed in the third quarter and I wondered, maybe starting with contract manufacturing, where there factors that kind of flattened that out, but then also in Proprietary Products were there mix differences from say second quarter or the first half that influenced the year-over-year expansion of margin? Thanks. Bernard Birkett : Yes. On the contract manufacturing, the margin expansion was a little bit slower than we would have expected in Q3 and we would have expected to see a little bit more and we have specific areas that we're targeting to improve the margin within contract manufacturing, so we have very focused groups working on that and so that is still a primary focus for us to make sure we start to see that margin expansion progressing through 2020, but it has been - in the third quarter, it was a little bit behind, where we would've expected it to be and we understand the reasoning behind us. It was regarding one or two of our facilities and the level of efficiency and productivity, we saw in those. So we have, as I said specific programs in place to tackle that.And on Proprietary, what we saw is from a standard margin perspective, we're pretty much in line with where we have been for most of the year or so, our mix is where we would expect it to be in the third quarter and we have a number of summer shutdowns, particularly in our European plants.So the level of absorption that we get in the third quarter is normally a little bit lower than what we see in the first half of the year and that was primarily the impact on margin. So it slows margin expansion, a little bit in the third quarter and that's something that we would have expected. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to our host. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Kevin.

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Gigi. Good morning and welcome to West fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call. We issued our financial results this morning and the release has been posted in the Investors Section on the company\u2019s website located at www.westpharma.com. This morning, CEO, Eric Green, and CFO, Bernard Birkett, will review our results, provide an update on our business and present our financial outlook for the full year 2019. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors Section of our website. On Slide 2 is the Safe Harbor statements. Statements made by the management on this call and in the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. Federal Securities Law. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and forecasts. The company\u2019s future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company and actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made here. Please refer to today\u2019s press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risk to which is the subject, including our 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports. During today\u2019s call, the management will also make reference to non-GAAP financial measures including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning\u2019s earnings release. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to West\u2019s CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a strong finish to 2019, and we\u2019re entering 2020 with good momentum, thanks to the solid execution of our Market-Led strategy. Overall, our 2019 performance demonstrated the favorable market conditions and durability of our business. The commitment and focus of our One West team is delivering superior value to customers. Through our high-quality products and solutions is what differentiates West as the global leader for containment and delivery of injectable medicines. We ended the year with 13% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. We expand growth and operating profit margins largely through strong high-value product sales growth and great results from our global operations initiatives. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, and we generated strong year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. As we enter 2020, we\u2019re building on the positive momentum we generated in 2019. We are introducing full year 2020 financial guidance that assumes organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the upper end of our usual 6% to 8% range. We\u2019re also forecasting double-digit earnings growth, adjusted for tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Bernard will go into greater detail on our 2020 guidance shortly. Slide 4 shows a detailed summary of the sales performance in 2019. Proprietary Product sales grew organically by 14.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 60% of Proprietary Product sales grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout the year. Let\u2019s take a look at the performance of the market units for the quarter. Starting with biologics. This market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. Our biologic customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma continue to come to West and our partner, Daikyo, as the preferred choice for high-value product offerings. This is reinforced by the very high participation rate we continue to experience with all new biologic and biosimilar approvals in 2019. The generics market unit finished the year on a solid note with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by sales of Westar components and products from our self-injection delivery platforms. As we have discussed in past calls, our self-injection delivery platforms are being adopted by not only biologic customers but also by small molecule generic customers looking to differentiate their drugs with our devices. Our pharma market unit saw double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, strong high-value product sales growth was a driver combined with a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the impact from the previously reported voluntary recall of our Vial2Bag product. And Contract Manufacturing ended the year with high single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again by sales of health care-related injection and diagnostic devices. On Slide 5, we have several exciting product launches that positions the company for continued growth, such as NovaPure 3 ml cartridge components that satisfy an unmet market need with the increase in sensitive biologic products being developed in dosages larger than 1 ml. We expanded our self-injection platform with SmartDose Gen. II injector with a patient experience in mind, enabling subcu delivery of high-viscosity drugs at dosages up to 10 mls. We also introduced an advanced elastomer formulation, which enhances performance and reliability featuring Westar Select quality and low particulate levels, while mitigating risk for our customers. And we launched AccelTRA Select, a line of products that provides generic customers with high quality, ready-to-use components with market-leading delivery times. Turning to Slide 6. We outlined our One West global operations strategy and management system. Operating with the excellence and efficiency that is inherent in our One West system has enabled our success and growth in 2018, and will do so for the foreseeable future. Our global operations team had another excellent year. The team is focused on continuous improvements related to service, quality and safety, while at the same time, driving efficiency gains. Over the past year, we completed the restructuring program that was announced in early 2018 and reduced our global manufacturing footprint to 25 sites. We are improving productivity, making more informed choices in capital investments and have set the stage for the next phase of improvements through automation and advanced manufacturing systems. The efficiencies we have gained by employing this new global operating system has meant we have additional cash available to reinvest in the business. Highlighted on Slide 7 are investments we completed in 2019 that will drive growth going forward. The acquisition of our Korean distributor creates a direct presence for West and a market seeing strong growth, especially in biologic drug manufacturing. We also increased a minority stake to 49% in Daikyo Seiko, Japan. After more than 40 years of partnership, we know that our two companies share a unique, committed to science, quality and technical expertise that continues to prove valuable to the customers and patients we serve together. In addition, in 2019, we enhanced our global digital capabilities with the opening of our Digital Technology Center in India. The DTC serves as a center of excellence for our global digital and transformation team, supporting many areas of our business, including digital marketing, data analytics and supporting the future of digital manufacturing and automation capabilities. Driving sustainable business practices has been a long-standing imperative at West, as shown on Slide 8. In 2019, we received several accolades for our efforts across the six pillars of our corporate responsibility program. At West, we are committed to nurturing a culture of diversity and inclusion along with supporting the communities in which our team members live and work through both philanthropy and sustainable business practices. We made great strides in both areas in 2019. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance, 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Let\u2019s review the numbers in more detail. We\u2019ll first look at Q4 2019 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in all four market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some year-end balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we\u2019ll review guidance for 2020. First up, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 20. We recorded net sales of $470.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth. We also saw double-digit organic sales growth in our three Proprietary Product market units and high single-digit organic sales growth in contract manufacturing. For the full year, we recorded net sales of $1.84 billion, representing organic sales growth of 10% and 10 basis points of inorganic growth. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $153.2 million in gross profit, $20 million or 15% above Q4 of last year, and our gross profit margin of 32.5% was 100 basis point expansion from the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 32.9% was a 110 basis point expansion from the previous year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $73.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $67.1 million in the same period last year for a 9% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 15.5% was a 40 basis point reduction from the same period last year. As mentioned on our Q3 call, SG&A expenses for Q4 2018 were low due to the release of bonuses, primarily as a result of the Vial2Bag recall. Adjusting for this, we would have seen adjusted operating profit margin expand by approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.1% for the year was 160 basis points increase from 2018. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for the quarter and approximately 15% for the year. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 13% for the quarter and 18% for the full year. So what\u2019s driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 10, we show the contribution to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.7 million or 12.2 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $3.3 million or 0.8 percentage points of growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $6.9 million or a reduction of 1.6 percentage points. Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.5% for Q4 2019, up from 31.5% in Q4 2018. Proprietary Products\u2019 fourth quarter gross profit margin of 38% was 100 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. Proprietary Products\u2019 full year gross profit of 38.6% was 150 basis points above the margin achieved in 2018. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products\u2019 gross profit margin for the fourth quarter were a favorable mix of products sold, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Our high-value products represented 63% of Q4 Proprietary Product sales and generated double-digit organic sales growth. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.4% was flat compared to the prior year quarter, however, we saw Contract Manufacturing margins show sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. Now, let\u2019s look at our balance sheet and review how we\u2019ve done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow of $367.2 million for the full year 2019, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the full year 2018 and a 27% increase. Our 2019 capital spending was $126.4 million, $21.7 million higher than a year ago but in line with guidance. Working capital of $717.1 million at December 31, 2019, was $106.4 million higher than at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance at December31 of $439.1 million was $101.7 million more than our December 2018 balance, primarily due to improved operating results. Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We expect our full year 2020 net sales guidance to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion, including an estimated headwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 7% to 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, and capital expenditures will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our EPS guidance. Estimated FX headwind has an impact of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, and it also includes \u2013 it also excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. To summarize the key takeaways for the year, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing; gross profit margin improvement; growth in operating profit margin; growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in full year 2019 operating and free cash flow. Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of continued organic sales growth and operating margin and EPS expansion. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. Our execution in 2019 has positioned us well for the year ahead. We\u2019re making significant progress on many fronts. Our Market-Led strategy is delivering unique value propositions to our customers. Our global operations team is delivering efficiencies and improvements in service and quality, and we\u2019re reinvesting in our business with digital technology, automation across our operations and strategic partnerships to fuel our future growth. Our mission to improve patient lives propels us each and every day. We do not take this for granted. We realize that our products are used by millions of patients across the globe on a daily basis, which is why we\u2019re so dedicated to continuously improving our capabilities. As we look to the future and the new drugs that are being launched by our customers, we know that West will play an integral part in bringing those medicines to market. We are committed in the growth strategy. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and we look forward to a successful 2020. Gigi, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hi, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Could you talk to, Eric, where \u2013 what you \u2013 what capacity expansions you are targeting? Is it more space in Waterford, et cetera? And then, I guess, the first question really should be, where do you think you are with your Six Sigma program that you\u2019ve implemented? Was last year, your first full year of it? Or was it your first year, you really thought it was gaining traction? Could you talk about kind of where you are with that program in your mind? And then the question on where the CapEx is going. Eric Green : Okay. First of all, thank you, Paul. Absolutely, I think we\u2019re early in the stage of lean implementations across the globe. I\u2019ve had the chance to travel to a number of our sites, as you know, across the globe and have continuously impressed on the momentum, the focus, the energy and the capabilities have launched this One West Lean improvement system. So, I\u2019d say we are in early stages, but we\u2019re seeing some excellent traction as we go forward. And I expect that this is not just a onetime impact, but this is an annual benefit that we\u2019ll see going forward and just puts us in a much better position as we think about future investments for West. In regards to capacity expansions, what we\u2019re looking at and what we\u2019re investing towards is more expansion of capacity on current existing platforms. To give you an example, we\u2019re investing in additional growth capacity in Crystal Zenith over what amount insert needle, pre-filled strings out of Scottsdale. We\u2019re also investing in further expansions in the self-injection devices of SelfDose and SmartDose based on current demand that we have committed by customers. So, these type of investments will continue to go into our high-value products like Kinston, Waterford, in other locations around the globe. But these \u2013 it\u2019s less than land and buildings. It\u2019s more about technology, automation and more modular cell manufacturing. Paul Knight : Thank you very much. Eric Green : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Windley : Hi, thanks. Congratulations on a really strong year. Appreciate you for taking my questions, and one of those is follow-up to Paul. Come at this CapEx spending a little bit different. You\u2019ve talked really from the time Bernard joined, the CapEx budget has come down pretty dramatically, hit maybe a lower point than we expected in 2018, up a little bit in 2019. I think your 7% target means it goes up another $15 million or $17 million in 2020. Can you talk maybe about the additional context of what is \u2013 not only where that \u2013 those dollars are going, as you just answered, but what\u2019s driving the reincrease of those dollars? Bernard Birkett : Hi, good morning, Dave. It\u2019s pretty much \u2013 the spend is pretty much in line with the percentage of revenues between 2019 to 2020, were pretty close. And when we look at the opportunities that are in front of us, more than half of that CapEx budget is going to be focused on growth opportunities, which tie back to the ones Eric have just spoken about. So, it\u2019s driven by customer land and customer interest. So, we typically spend between $40 million to $50 million on maintenance CapEx. And on IT, we\u2019re looking at about $10 million to $15 million. So, the balance is really on all growth opportunities. And again, it\u2019s an on expanding capacity, primarily through introducing you spend on equipment. David Windley : Got it. And then kind of related to that, the digital rollout, I think automation kind of just would be \u2013 become part of that definition. We, in a trip, saw that Kinston is kind of a base case for that. I wondered if you could talk about what you see as the timeframe for rolling out some automated manufacturing through some of your other key sites. And then what like margin benefit, and what kind of efficiency power that has for the business as you do that? Eric Green : Yes. No, David. We implemented, as you know, the automated work cell in Kinston. Last year, we had it as a pilot and validated with the customers. We\u2019re actually \u2013 in 2020, we\u2019re expanding that capability, and we\u2019re looking at three additional locations in Ireland, Germany and also in Singapore to allow us to have more reach to certain products and certain customers across the globe. So, we\u2019re actually quite encouraged by the initial success we\u2019ve had in 2019, and we\u2019ll be expanding that as we go forward. What\u2019s really also important is that the digital aspect of that with the team that we\u2019ve built in India, they\u2019re able to actually start capturing the data and making it much more effective and efficient as we go forward. So Bernie, you want to talk a little bit about the \u2013 on this? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So Dave, it\u2019s a multiyear process, and we have developed automation for some of our product lines, and we will continue to further develop that over the next number of years, and it will be rolled out on a phased basis. And the objective of doing that is, obviously, is to create more efficiencies and support the long-term construct that we have of driving 100 basis points improvement year-over-year. And so it\u2019s to facilitate that and also to keep up with the demand that we\u2019re seeing from our customers and also to drive higher quality. So, automation brings us a number of benefits. And again, though, it is a multiyear process. David Windley : Got it. Last quick question on the \u2013 could you quantify \u2013 maybe you did and I missed it. But could you quantify the benefit to EPS in 2019 from stock comp that would be equivalent to kind of what you\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s not the right way to ask it. But the benefit from stock comp that you\u2019re not including in 2020 guidance? Bernard Birkett : For the year, it was about $0.14 in 2019. David Windley : Okay, great. Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Great. Just a real quick follow-up. The $0.14 the year for the stock comp benefit, what was it in the quarter? Eric Green : Yes, $0.02. Larry Solow : $0.02, okay, great. Eric Green : Yes. Larry Solow : Okay, great. So just taking a step back. So really great quarter, great \u2013 obviously, the outlook. Just looking on the Proprietary segment. A little bit surprised on the generic side that you have high single digits for the full year and double-digit growth in the quarter. Do you see that continuing? And what is driving that? And the second part of the question, can you give us a little update on AccelTRA and how that\u2019s progressing? Is that still sort of in the early stages? Eric Green : Yes. So, Larry, thank you for that. We are seeing a couple of key drivers in the generic space. We do believe \u2013 we think long term, we always talk about mid- to high single-digit growth in the generic space. And what we\u2019re seeing is very strong high-value product, which is being led by a couple areas. One is, as you pointed out, the transition, the work we\u2019re \u2013 we have around AccelTRA and moving customers from standard to high-value product portfolio. The second area we\u2019re seeing an uptick and the demand are around self-injection, the platform. And in particularly, when you start thinking about SmartDose and SelfDose. So there\u2019s an uptake demand that we see right now that we \u2013 we\u2019re pretty confident as we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to see that growth. So I\u2019m pleased with the success of generics. But for the full year of 2019, we saw the growth, not just with the large generic clients, but also the mid- to small customers also, which is very encouraging, that we\u2019re increasing penetration. Larry Solow : Great. And you mentioned SmartDose, obviously, accelerating a lot of \u2013 a lot more trials, I guess, getting underway. Last quarter, you spoke about some pretty good momentum in CZ, I think to date through Q3 you had five approvals. Could you maybe just give us a little update on how CZ is going and outlook into 2020? Eric Green : Yes. That\u2019s one of the areas we\u2019re investing in actually manufacturing expansion as we speak because demand is pushing our limits on capacity. So, we are currently in process of expanding capacity in our facilities, and we\u2019re very encouraged with the number of not just products that of not just products that have just been approved and launched, but also what\u2019s in the pipeline. So, it does go back to \u2013 unfortunately, it goes back a few years ago. We talked about, once you get one or two clients comfortable, when you commercialize, there\u2019s been a wave of interest and especially with the sensitivity of new biologics coming to the market where Crystal Zenith is the real \u2013 the true configuration that they\u2019re looking for long term. Larry Solow : Okay, great. And then just on the margin expansion. Obviously, you had, I think, 160 bps you mentioned for the year, a little more than 100 on the growth side. As we look out and with the restructuring, do you see in 2020, I assume you\u2019re still sort of targeting that 100 bps plus overall margin expansion. Do you see it favoring the gross profit line more than operating expense line or any color on that? Eric Green : Yes. So, we \u2013 again, a lot of it is just driven by mix and high-value products. And then that\u2019s supported with improvements and efficiencies. So, we would look at probably 70% to 80% of the growth coming on the gross margin line and then the balance coming from leveraging OpEx. Larry Solow : Okay. And then in the years past, SG&A has been a little bit back-end loaded. It was not \u2013 the prior year is a little bit more \u2013 a little more flat. Can you maybe just give us any color you have on sort of cadence of the year for that? Eric Green : Yes. We\u2019re \u2013 the way we\u2019re managing SG&A is to keep it pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter, we shouldn\u2019t have very large spikes. And if there are any spike on account, we will attempt to call them out before they actually happen to give you visibility on that. But you could see that the way it was managed throughout 2019, it was pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. Larry Solow : Okay. And then just last question on the high-value products. I think that you said over 60% of revenue dollars. Can you tell us what was in terms of volume, and Proprietary Products, or as the whole company, you want to tell there? Bernard Birkett : Yes, when you \u2013 with that type of growth that we\u2019re experiencing strong double digits, it\u2019s a little over 100 basis points increase from prior year. Larry Solow : Got it, great. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate it. Eric Green : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Avendano from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Juan Avendano : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and guidance as well in 2020. I had a few questions. I guess, you ended 2019 pretty strong, I guess, now I think that it would be appropriate or if you could please give us an update on the market penetration levels for high-value products overall and across some of your images, including Westar, FluroTec, Envision, NovaPure? At what level do you see that going to? Eric Green : Yes. Juan, thank you for participating. I think when we look at the high-value product portfolio and where the penetration is, you\u2019re absolutely correct. If you look at majority of the revenues are more of the products we introduced several years ago. And you think about NovaPure, which has been launched, but the uptake is significant. In fact, that\u2019s the other area of capacity expansion we have going on, both in U.S. and Europe to keep up with demand. So while the percentage is, let\u2019s say it\u2019s smaller, like, i.e., less than 10% of the high-value product portfolio, it\u2019s going to be much more meaningful over the next few years to come. So, we\u2019re really confident of the runway we have ahead of us and the penetration of when we go from Envision all the way up to NovaPure, through what we see in the pipeline will only increase. And that\u2019s really all I can say at this point in time. We believe it\u2019s a double-digit growth portfolio, driven by the high-value products on the NovaPure, higher-end products of that portfolio, and it\u2019s going to be about 100-plus basis point volume expansion every year just to keep up with that demand. Juan Avendano : Okay, good. And I guess, we\u2019ll see this when you file your 10-K. But can you give us an idea of how your backlog of committed orders and Proprietary Products ending 2019 compares to 2018? Bernard Birkett : We continue to see that grow. We\u2019re seeing a lot of strong demand. And again, it\u2019s across \u2013 particularly in the biologics space. And based on a number of the products that Eric has spoken about. So \u2013 and that \u2013 you know that when we talk about confidence, that\u2019s where we\u2019re getting a lot of our confidence from is the growth in that order book. Juan Avendano : Okay. And regarding the Vial2Bag recall, how is the solution of this matter going? And have you included any Vial2Bag revenue in your 2020 guidance? Bernard Birkett : We have not included anything in our 2020 guidance, and that\u2019s primarily based on the approval process and the regulatory process of getting back into the market. Some of that is outside of our control. So we just took a conservative approach on that to step back and say, well, when we get regulatory approval, then we\u2019ll add it into our guidance. Again, we don\u2019t want to be making excuses after the fact. Juan Avendano : Okay. And I might have missed this but how many basis points of operating margin expansion are you looking to realize in 2020? What\u2019s embedded in your guidance? Bernard Birkett : In the guidance is an implying \u2013 implied range between 90 to 120. Juan Avendano : 90 to 120 and my last one, I\u2019m sorry, but given the strength that you\u2019re seeing in Crystal Zenith and the fact that you\u2019re spending CapEx to build capacity there. I guess, if you could tell us what was \u2013 what is the revenue of Proprietary delivery devices, I guess, that you had in 4Q? And how do you see that in 2020? Eric Green : Hey, Juan, we don\u2019t break it down to that level. But what we can say is that the Proprietary devices grew strong double digits. Juan Avendano : Okay. The last update I got was about $40 million a quarter was the run rate a couple of years ago. And so, I mean, are you significantly above that now? Bernard Birkett : Well, that part of the business has been growing really strong double digits. So yes, we\u2019re significantly higher than that. Juan Avendano : Okay. Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Owens from William Blair. Your line is now open. Courtney Owens : Hi, guys. Good morning. Eric Green : Good morning, Courtney. Courtney Owens : Good morning. In the press release, you guys mentioned the small acquisition contribution. Can you expand on like what that actually was this quarter? I don\u2019t know, I guess, like what the acquisition was, not with the contribution. But, yes. Eric Green : Right. So, we had two \u2013 well, actually, one investment from an acquisition point of view is small, but it was done in Q2 of \u2013 earlier of 2018. We just call out the contribution that has had on the quarters following the close of that acquisition. It\u2019s GIS Korea, which is our entry strategy into the Korean marketplace. So now, we have a direct presence that we\u2019re going directly to the biopharma manufacturers in that region. Courtney Owens : Got it. Okay. And then just if you could talk about any M&A opportunities or priorities that you guys kind of considering or looking towards over the next 12 months, that would be great as well. Eric Green : Well, one thing I can comment there is that we\u2019ll continuously look at the landscape and see what assets, if available, would make sense to be part of West that enables us to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers. So I can\u2019t comment any further about any of the specific targets, but we are constantly looking at the horizon, saying what would be the right fit with West. Courtney Owens : Okay, thanks. And then my last question, the Contract Manufacturing segment came in a little bit stronger than we were expecting this quarter. I know you kind of talked about, I guess, the dynamics in the Proprietary business that drove that gross margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what were the drivers behind the sequential expansion in the Contract Manufacturing business? Bernard Birkett : It\u2019s purely accelerated customer demand coming from specific customers. And the really positive thing was that West was able to respond quickly to that customer demand and supply it when it was needed. And so it\u2019s \u2013 again, it\u2019s just purely demand in that market. And it was a little bit stronger than we would have expected it to be. But again, the positive thing is we were able to respond to that. Courtney Owens : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Bernard Birkett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Gigi and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s conference call.

Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.The past several months have been some of the most difficult times for our communities across the world as we face challenging circumstances related to COVID 19. This pandemic has made clear the importance of global health care and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. Our mission to improve patient lives cannot be any more meaningful than in times like today. We take great pride that for nearly 100 years we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines. Despite the COVID-19 challenges, the West team remains focused on creating and delivering value to all our stakeholders.West has two priorities that are guiding us through this pandemic. First and foremost, we're focused on the well-being and safety of our team members across the globe. Our crisis management team was engaged at the outset implementing precautionary measures across our company to protect our teams.It seems nearly every day I learned about another great way that our team is stepping up to deliver the critical components to meet the urgent needs of our customers and their patients while looking out for the safety of one another. These moments are not only inspirational, but they serve as a testament to the collective strength of the One West team and I'm grateful for their unwavering commitment to our mission.In addition, our culture of philanthropy and community involvement has our team members offering their time, unique skills and knowledge in support of local response efforts.Turning to slide four. Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers. The strong tenets of our market led strategy and globalization of the manufacturing network are contributing to the resiliency of West's business in today's climate.I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we experienced throughout 2019 have continued in the first quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive.Despite the current challenges so far, we have been able to maintain operations at normal capacity. For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our world-class global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up the increase in demand.Because of the constantly changing environment and its effect on the economy, we conduct business impact analyses daily and make adjustments as they are required. These assessments are an integral part of our business continuity plans within each of our global sites and operations network. Throughout the past several months, we have monitored our supply chain including our close partner Daikyo and at this time, do not foresee any negative impact from direct or indirect suppliers.As the pandemic has intensified as expected we have seen an increase in customer orders in recent weeks. We are monitoring order flow to ensure that we're addressing the true demand for our products.As shown on slide five, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first quarter performance and we entered the second quarter well-positioned. We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter largely through strong high-value product sales. This resulted in double-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the first quarter.As we enter the second quarter, the demand for our products continues to be solid from both existing customers as well as new opportunities from companies looking to develop COVID-19 solutions. Each day seems to bring new challenges; supply chain, transportation, government regulations. And I want to emphasize that across West, we're operating with a sense of urgency to address and manage these issues.Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric and good morning. I hope everyone is healthy and safe during this time.So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance primarily in our Biologics and Generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020.First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on slide six and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 13 to 16. We recorded net sales of $491.5 million representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth.Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 11.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which make up more than 63% of Proprietary Products sales grew double-digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1.Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings.The Generics market units experienced high single-digit growth led by sales -- excuse me, of Westar and FluroTec components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services including : Westar, NovaPure and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection systems.Moving to slide seven. We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded $167 million in gross profit $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90 basis point expansion from the same period last year.We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% for Q1. Excluding stock tax benefit, EPS grew by approximately 31%.So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On slide eight, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $51.1 million or 11.5 percentage points of growth. Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.7 million or a reduction of 2.2 percentage points.Looking at margin performance, slide nine shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 34% for Q1 2020, up from 33.1% in Q1 2019. Proprietary Products' first quarter gross profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products.Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, Contract Manufacturing's first quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion.Now let's look at our balance sheet and review, how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase. Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020 was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program. Our capital and financial resources including overall liquidity remains strong.Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates, compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62 compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55. Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million.There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07, based on current foreign currency exchange rates, compared to prior guidance of $0.04. The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 EPS impact from our first quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation.So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter. Strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion.I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. Our company is financially strong. Today, more than ever, the pursuit of our mission is priority and not taken for granted.West products are needed by patients across the globe and in many cases for the administration of life-saving medicines. As the market leader we are committed to ensure continuity of supply to our customers around the globe.In addition, we are supporting our many customers that are developing potential solutions to address COVID-19 with components for diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. We are confident in our long-term growth strategy.Although these are trying times, we are optimistic and dedicated to doing what is necessary supporting the healthcare industry, as it works to resolve this global pandemic. We will emerge from this experience collectively stronger. And on behalf of all of the team members at West, it is our wish that you stay healthy and safe, in the days ahead.Andrew, we're ready to take questions. Thank you.Question-and-Answer Session Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Larry Solow : Hey good morning guys. And thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter, good start. Eric Green : Great, thank you Larry. Larry Solow : Just on the Proprietary sales question on that side of it. Obviously very good growth and coming from the usual suspects here. I'm particularly impressed with the margin side. And the growth side, 130 bps up, year-over-year. And I think, last year Q1 was also a very good quarter.So, on a full year basis it was up over 150 bps. I'm not asking will these trends continue. But just what -- if you peel back the onion a little bit it seems like obviously mix is driving a lot of that.And is that just mix within mix as you not only increase your high-value products percentage but maybe go up to scale within high-value products to more of like say the NovaPure and stuff like that? Can you give us a little more color on that? Eric Green : Yes, Larry. Good morning and thank you for the question, it's good to hear your voice. You're absolutely correct. There's -- what's happening with Proprietary is really two levers are being pulled simultaneously.One is the high-value product mix effect but more importantly is that we're seeing increased growth and contribution of that growth with the products that have even higher margins. You start thinking about NovaPure, Daikyo, Crystal Zenith, even the FluroTec.And when you look at those in totality, that's roughly let's say about half of the incremental growth when it comes to the high-value products and with a much higher margin. So the mix shift is occurring through high-value products, but even more pronounced with the higher-margin subsets of that portfolio.The second lever that we are holding and the team is doing a really good job is this globalization of our operations. And as you know, we've been on this journey for a couple of years now and the team has done a phenomenal job to start implementing lean processes and initiatives across our plants which is allowing us to be more efficient and more effective and higher throughput.So the combination of both of them is giving us that type of margin expansion in Proprietary. And what excites me is if we think about the future pipeline it is around the NovaPure the FluroTec the CZ the self-injection portfolio. And that's what's really exciting as we think about the long-term growth trajectory of this business. Larry Solow : Okay. Great, and then just switching gears if I just may on COVID-19, just sort of a couple of questions there. How do you gauge sort of surge in orders true -- versus sort of true demand any timing impact?And is the gear up in diagnostics and potential vaccines and therapies is that even -- is that moving the needle for you guys in the short run?And then lastly on, the COVID with the drop in oil -- a significant drop in oil, I realize there'll be some lag effect to that but I would assume that would benefit you guys on as we look out the next few quarters. Thanks. Eric Green : Yes, Larry. In the COVID-19, specifically around our sales and products being introduced to support and I mentioned three areas around diagnostics, therapeutics and also vaccines. In Q1, we did not see any incremental revenue as a company due to COVID-19. We had some -- frankly Bernard can get in a little more detail, but we did have some additional costs. But what we're seeing right now and with the approach, we've taken with this -- with the market units we're able to have much more granular discussions with our customers. And as we start thinking about Q2 and Q3, we are actively working in all three corridors.To give you an example in the diagnostics our Contract Manufacturing arm of the business is currently scaling up on consumable products that are used in a couple of the devices that have been introduced in the market recently in the pipe. We won't speak about any specific customer, but these have been introduced recently into the hospitals in the clinic setting.When it comes to therapeutics there are a few that are in a market that we're already supporting and has been commercialized but they're currently, as you know, going through clinical tests to see the ability to combat COVID-19 and we're in those areas.And then lastly the vaccines, and those are a little more long-term as we look out 2021. And our FluroTec technology is a perfect candidate for the vaccine market. So it's kind of a staged approach and we'll see some of the benefit in 2020 and -- but most of it will be in 2021. You want to Bernard talk about the oil impact. Bernard Birkett : Yes. So there are some -- there'll be a tailwind from oil, but there is also some headwinds that we're going to see to offset that. So particularly around the logistics side and on freight, we're seeing some increased costs there given the well-documented issues with getting products to customers and just the supply chain itself and the impact COVID is having on that. And then, we have also some other costs that we're absorbing in supporting our employees as we're managing through the pandemic. We saw some of it in Q1 and there were some primarily showed up in our CM gross margin, which was probably impacted most by that. But I think, again, we will see some benefit, but there are other headwinds and offsets there. Larry Solow : Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Eric Green : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney. Paul Knight : Hi. Eric, could you talk about what you need to do to minimize the risk of a facility shutdown. I know, you're operating in effectively a clean room operation in many sites. But do you have to go another step higher? And you do alternate shifts? What do you to reduce your risk for these facilities? Eric Green : Yes. Thank you, Paul, and good morning. No, you're absolutely correct. We took a very proactive approach months ago when we started to see what we learned from our colleagues in Asia, particularly in our Qingpu facility in China, and also in South -- and Singapore. What we've done is we've taken a -- there's multiple steps that we've taken. One is the split shifts to minimize -- as they did the shift handovers minimize interaction so that social distancing is very important. Also, temperature monitoring. We also put a program in place that only essential employees were allowed to go into the facility. So you can imagine at our plants all the 25 plants around the world we have very important roles, but these are individuals that actually can work from remotely, and so we put that in place immediately.One other element we put in place is we really focused on ensuring that when our colleagues are not feeling well or there's some question about their health that they don't feel pressure to come into the office. So we relaxed some of our attendance policies. We improved. We expanded our compensation, if somebody had to stay home for a period of time with the COVID taking care of themselves and/or their family members.So those are many different levers that we put in place and to ensure that people are in the plants should be in the plants and also mitigating any risk that we have for maybe coming from the outside. This crisis management team we put in place is monitoring it daily. We can tell you, if there's absenteeism issues in any particular site.And I am very pleased and actually humbled on how well the absenteeism is very low in multiple sites. And I know in Europe it went up slightly, but it came back down to normal rates in the last several weeks, which is a real testament and our employees really understand the purpose of why we're doing this and to support the community.So, there's a lot of levers that we pull, Paul. It's not just one solution there's many. And we're not going to let off on the intensity of this -- of our approach, because we cannot afford to have an issue at a point. Paul Knight : And lastly regarding could you tell if there was stocking going on in the industry in Q1? Eric Green : Yes, Paul. We do not see stock and I'll tell you why. You know our business very well, it's that, we're really make to order. So November and December is really the time period of when we look at Q1 demand that we need to manufacture over the following three to four months.I will tell you this though. In recent weeks the conversations have intensified where customers are coming to us and that's where our commercial organization has done a great job of categorizing and working with customers to alleviate their concerns not to do increasing safety stock, because our lead times have not increased, because of the global network that we put in place.So and we were able to categorize any incremental revenues is it due to vaccines, therapeutics, supporting therapies, hospital enablement, and also frankly increasing safety stocks and that's what we're keeping an eye on at this point in time. That has been as pronounced. We've learned our lesson back in 2015 and 2016. And so we're very conscious of that and we have the right programs in place to monitor and manage through this. Paul Knight : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Danlei Yan : Hi. Good morning. This is Danlei Yan for Dave. Thanks for taking our question. I think you mentioned in Proprietary Products that your mix is improving toward higher-margin HVPs. And I want to hone in on NovaPure a little bit. Can you give us a sense of how large that is as a percentage of Proprietary Products? And what the growth is? And then is the growth being driven by existing products or an expansion of the product portfolio in that line? Eric Green : Danlei, it's twofold. One is, it's expanding the NovaPure or Nova brand portfolio with additional products and capabilities. But it is -- if you think about NovaPure, it's actually close to a double for an absolute dollar value during the quarter and that's a trend that we're currently seeing that started back in late 2018 and 2019.I'll give you an example one new product portfolio we launched with NovaPure is a one with 3 ml, which we believe -- plunger which we believe can continue to help have this growth rate continue. And we have a very high participation rate on NDAs. So this is a very positive portfolio, and -- but there's a lot of runway ahead of us in that area. Bernard Birkett : And we've also seen growth in other high-value products. So with CZ, FluroTec, RU, self-injection systems. So we've seen growth -- strong growth in all of those areas through Q1 and it's represented in many of the -- in the various market units. It's not just in one market unit. Danlei Yan : Great. Thanks for the detail. I had maybe a follow-up question. The company had a really strong first quarter, but revenue guidance was reaffirmed. And so I was wondering if you could give us some of the puts and takes of that guiding in the context of how strong Q1 was? Eric Green : Yes. I want to -- let me start and then Bernard will talk a little more about the puts and takes. I just want to caution. I mean absolutely when you think about -- if you look at the resiliency of the business and how the team is executing well under these circumstances and I do truly believe the tenets that we put in place are market led the globalization of the operations digitization, which is allowing us to get better analytics and real-time information it's really allowing us to drive growth. And we saw that -- similar growth in Q1. We saw that in Q4 last year. And so we believe it's a continuation.But frankly speaking the operating environment that everybody is in today is difficult. And so we want to be -- from my point of view, we want to be prudent and stick with what we've guided. I know there's some additional elements to that that Bernard will go through and we'll get more data points over the next several weeks and months so that we -- next time we have this call, we can get better information on how the trajectory will go for the balance of the year.Bernie you want to give some puts and takes. Bernard Birkett : Yes. And the other piece on that you've got to remember is the FX headwind that we have forecasted has moved from $15 million to $26 million. So if you take that into account and we're absorbing that while maintaining guidance between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion. So essentially it is raising guidance on revenue. And as Eric said, it's still early in the year. We're in unprecedented times with a lot of unknowns out there.So, again, we felt it was the right thing to do to maintain where we are and see how the remainder of the year progresses. But what we're seeing is that our order book is solid. Our manufacturing and operation units are functioning as they should and in line with our expectations and we weathered some storms in the first quarter. But again I don't think it's appropriate to raise it much higher at this point. You've got to think -- you've got to remember that piece on the FX. Danlei Yan : Great. Got it. Thanks for the color. Bernard Birkett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Juan Avendano with Bank of America. Juan Avendano : Hi. Hello, good morning. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for the role that you're playing through this pandemic. Eric Green : Thank you. We really appreciate that. Juan Avendano : I guess my first question is you used to give us an update annually on your participation rate across your different customer segments. Can you give us such an update for 2019 across biologics, generics and pharma?And related to this question I know that this is a long-term opportunity on the COVID-19 vaccines but what participation rate do you anticipate to have among COVID-19 drugs and vaccines that are currently in development? Eric Green : Yes. Juan on the participation rate last year in 2019, I'll put it this way. Our biologics participation rate is higher than it has been or equal to a little bit higher. So it's close to 100% as we get. And then in the generics and in the pharma space they actually improved. So our participation rate is -- it continued to improve.In regards to COVID-19 specifically around vaccine as customer, we won't give out customer names. But I can tell you that we're on many of the products that we currently develop and we'll be going into clinical trials hopefully soon that we can participate on that. I think reason why we have a good, very strong participation rate in vaccines is one of the characteristics is required is the coating on the elastomer. And the FluroTec technology is a market-leading technology. So we're feeling really good in that regard.Secondly around that when we start thinking about the criticality or the urgency to get these materials manufactured, it gives us the ability to flex our global operations. And as we're building 40-plus billion components a year, the demand on vaccines while it's important it's a good size, it's not going to be too much of a challenge considering we have multiple sites that can produce these products using FluroTec's technology. So that's how I would look at it from the vaccine perspective for the participation rate. Juan Avendano : Got it. Thank you. Your backlog of committed orders on Proprietary Products, it did increase by 44% year-over-year in 2019 according to your 10-K that you filed. I was wondering, if you could give us an update on your backlog of Proprietary Products orders that are committed as of the end of the first quarter? What the magnitude of the change has been? And can you remind us what your average production lead time is from the time you receive an order until you produce it and ship it? Eric Green : Yes. So we won't update the quarterly number but I can say it's solid. It's consistent. In fact with some of the discussions that we're having in regards to products used for therapeutics and/or vaccines that would ensure that that number stays solid.I think from a range of lead times I think the team has done a great job if you think about where we are today and we monitor this on a very -- on a weekly basis. We're about eight to 11 weeks on average. It does -- it is based on the product and the additional capabilities that we provide around that. But I would say, we're pretty stable at 8 weeks to 11 weeks at this point in time. Juan Avendano : Okay. All right. Thank you. Bernard Birkett : You got to also take into account that the order patterns from customers is changing slightly. Customers are actually placing longer orders with us. So they're not -- it's not just one or two quarters. It's actually our over three, four quarters and maybe beyond. So the real positive for that is that it gives us a lot of greater visibility and being able to meet customer demand within the lead times of the 8 weeks to 11 weeks on average. Juan Avendano : Okay. Good. Can you tell us what's embedded in your guidance -- revenue guidance for 2020 as far as the outlook by customer segment? I mean Biologics Generics and Pharma. What growth revenue growth do you expect? Bernard Birkett : So on Biologics, we're looking at double-digit growth. Pharma will be low to mid-single digits. And then Generics is mid to high single-digit growth. Contract Manufacturing will be high single digits possibly early double-digit growth. Juan Avendano : Got it. Thank you. It seems that the pricing contribution in the sales revenue growth in 1Q was 1.5 percentage points, which is a little bit higher than your historical average. Can you talk about the pricing dynamics on high-value products maybe and your components? And how much pricing you can get given this environment? Eric Green : Yes. I think when you look at pricing, it's plus or minus 1% historically after the last three or four years. You're right it's -- at 1.5 it's a little more on the higher end of that. So it's a very -- it's not a big variance. But I think what we're seeing right now is when you think about the growth that we're seeing in high-value products particularly the areas that Bernard and I spoke of these tend to be new molecules.So when we bring a customer on to those products, the price contribution doesn't kick-in until a year or two later, right? So that anniversary is out from a new product status. So we're about 1.5 in the first quarter. It'll be plus or minus of that going forward. And I think we're able to maintain our pricing structure when you consider that our focus is to convert more customers to the higher end of high-value products. Juan Avendano : Okay. Good. And my last one if I may. I mean not to nitpick, I mean, you're getting good margin expansion driven by your high-value product conversion and the good organic growth on Proprietary Products. But the gross margin did come in a little bit light relative to my estimate on the Contract Manufactured product segment. I guess, my question is when could we see mid to high teens gross margin in that segment relative to how it was before -- 2017 and before? Bernard Birkett : Yes. In Q1, we had some costs that we absorbed within well -- across all our operational units and there was a particular impact in CM regarding supporting employees as we go through COVID-19. So we have incurred some costs there. And that was a decision by management and it was the right decision to do that. If we exclude those costs and if business as normal our margin in CM would have been north of 15%.The impact on the Proprietary business was a lot less. But -- so that gives us encouragement to know that we're on the right track and our teams are delivering within Contract Manufacturing to get to the mid to high teens. We will be making progress throughout 2020 and into early 2021. But we are on the right track. That there were -- it was onetime cost. Juan Avendano : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you very much and I will follow-up offline. Congratulations. Bernard Birkett : Thanks, Juan. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Courtney Owens with William Blair. Courtney Owens : Hi, guys. Good morning. Eric Green : Good morning, Courtney. Courtney Owens : Good morning. My first question is around the updated kind of top line guidance. I know you kind of answered this a little bit earlier for somebody else's question, but just wanted to kind of talk more about like on the organic side. So, you guys started the year very strong. And I think in your prepared remarks Eric you said that you guys didn't really see any COVID-related revenues yet in Q1. So it's probably hard to say from your vantage point, but is really I guess if you kind of look at the rest of the year that confidence that you have that you guys will be towards the higher end of your organic or your long-term organic guidance of that 6% to 8%, is that driven by just like the base demand for the business? Or is it more so related to the COVID-related like incremental demand? Or kind of if you have to pick between that mix which side does it more fall on that you have that confidence that you'll get to that 8% as opposed to the 7% to 8% that you guys talked about last quarter? Thanks. Eric Green : Yes. Courtney I would say that the confidence is on the base business on the core business. We are aware of additional opportunities when it comes to the COVID-19 and the solutions that our customers are working towards. But that's a fluid and dynamic environment in regards to which therapies -- or therapeutics and/or vaccines will get through and at what time. And so when we have better visibility and clarity around that then we'll bring that into the discussion.On the CM side, it's a little bit higher in Q1 that we -- than we traditionally would see. And I think that will come down a little bit going back to what Bernard said earlier the full year probably looking at high-single-digits, maybe touching the 10% mark. But on the Proprietary side, the underlying core business, if you look at Q1 and Q4 of last year and the momentum that has been built up on the core, it's been relatively consistent. So it gives me confidence that the guidance that Bernard walked us through is really taking a lot of the opportunity to pull the 2019 out. Bernard Birkett : And it's hard to estimate like that. Now there's a lot of discussions around COVID that -- and we need to see something more concrete, and it'll probably get more visibility as we progress through the second quarter here. And we'll give you a better insight into that I think on our Q2 call. But it's still early. There's a lot of moving pieces in that area. Courtney Owens : Okay. Got it. Thanks guys. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Andrew. Thank you for joining us on today's conference call. An online archive of the broadcast will be available on our website at westpharma.com in the Investors' section.

I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast in our commitment to supply the much needed components and solutions to our customers under tough circumstances. Our Q2 performance emphasizes the continued result of our talented team members, the strength of our company, and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times. We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients, which could be more meaningful than at times like today. Driven by our mission, we experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market led strategy to continuously deliver value for our customers and the patients we jointly serve. Moving to Slide 4, the pandemic remains our priority. Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge sense of urgency in vaccine development. As the market leader, our teams are working tirelessly with our customers to ensure we supply the right components and solutions to help resolve this pandemic. The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines is a complex one driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. We're helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components. We're doing this in a way that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale up and launch of any successful vaccine candidates. As we stated during our first quarter earnings call, we have seen a high adoption rate of our fluoropolymer coated stopper made by both West and our partner Daikyo. These Are the industry standard for packaging sensitive molecules with an outstanding track record of quality and reliability. Notably, some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made this decision to use the best in industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. As our customers vaccine development rapidly moves into clinical trials, the entire West team has stepped up to make certain we can supply the demand for high value products as well as any immediate surge and requests for therapeutics. The organization is also preparing for the potential volume surges that could come if and when vaccines are approved for human use. All the work over the past few years across the enterprise to drive commercial and operational excellence, along with globalizing West's manufacturing operations has put us in the best possible position to meet the future pandemic demand. We are accelerating our capacity expansion to manufacture FluroTec and NovaPure components. These investments were in our five-year plan, and we have brought them forward to address the expected increase in demand the latter part of this year and into 2021. From our perspective, it is still too early to estimate how much volume could be generated by vaccine packaging. However, whether it's hundreds of millions or billions of doses, our West team is prepared and ready when the time comes. Turning to Slide 5 and our performance in the second quarter, our financial position remains strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters have continued in the second quarter and the outlook for the bounce of the year remains positive. We had 14% organic sales growth in the second quarter driven again by robust high value product sales. And with HVP sales growth, we've experienced strong growth and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS for the second quarter. To be clear, the majority of the organic growth in the second quarter was from our base business with some incremental growth coming from COVID-19 sales related to therapeutics. As for guidance, we believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year. That said, because of the strength and resiliency of our core, underlying business, and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with COVID-19 solutions, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year. Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and the outlook. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric and good morning. I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe during this time. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our Biologics and Generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter, as well as some balance sheet takeaways and finally, we'll review guidance for 2020. First up Q2, our financial results are summarized on Slide 6 and the reconciliation of non-US GAAP measures are described in Slides 13 to 17. We recorded net sales of $527.2 million, representing organic sales growth of 14.3%. COVID related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $19 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic and stay at home restrictions, such as dental, veterinary and elective procedures. We continue to see improvement in gross profits. We recorded $195.1 million in gross profit, 37.2 million or 23.6% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 37% was a 340 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profits with $106 million recorded this quarter, compared to 81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally adjusted diluted EPS grew 40% for Q2. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2, EPS grew by approximately 38%. Moving to Slide 7, our Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 13.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 65% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high value product offering. The Generics market unit experienced double-digit growth led by FluroTec and film coated products sales. Our pharma market units saw low single digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, lead once again by sales of diagnostic and healthcare related injection devices. So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $59.4 million or 12.6 percentage points of growth, including approximately $19 million of volume driven by COVID-19 related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $7.8 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.6 million or a reduction of two percentage point. Looking at margin performance, Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q2 2020, up from 33.6% in Q2 2019. Proprietary Products second quarter gross profit margin of 42.8% was 330 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix a product sold driven by high-value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Contract manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 19% was 470 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. The improvement is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. There was approximately 180 to 200 basis points positive impact on margin primarily due to a one-time engineering project work. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our gross profit expansion. One point to note, we took a one-time charge of $6.3 million for asset impairment. This is included in other operating expense. Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $205.2 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of 52.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 34% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $69.2 million, 12.1 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $735.4 million at June 30, 2020, was 18.3 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in inventory mainly as a result of increasing our safety stock levels and accounts receivable due to increased sales activity. Both DSO and DPO improved in the quarter. Our cash balance at June 30 of $445.9 million was 6.8 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. Our capital and financial resources including overall liquidity remain strong. Turning to guidance, Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.035 billion and $2.055 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of $60 million. There is an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 12.5%. This compares to prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $1.97 billion and growth of 8%. We do expect growth in Contract Manufacturing to be less than H2 versus H1 as a result of tougher comps. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.25, compared to prior guidance of $3.52 to $3.62. As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 On COVID-19 vaccine demand. CapEx guidance has raised to $170 million to $80 million. This compares to previous guidance of 130 million to 140 million. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.16 EPS impact from our H1 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our long-term construct remains at approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and continued EPS expansion. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. We have a rich history of leading in times of great challenge. Our customers expect this of us and this is what we're committed and prepared to do. I want to emphasize that across West, we are leveraging our global manufacturing capabilities, size and scale, to innovate, lead and operate with a sense of urgency to make a positive impact in healthcare and society. Our performance continues to reaffirm that our market lead strategy is delivering unique value propositions to our customers. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products with market leading service and quality. And we're continuing to invest in our business with digital technology and automation across our operations to fuel an even brighter future. We remain committed to delivering value to all our stakeholders on a sustainable basis, as well as to maintain and build upon the values that make up our one West team. On behalf of the team members at West, we continue to wish you good health in the days ahead. Josh, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Avendano with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Juan Avendano : Hi, good morning. Thank you and congratulations on the quarter and the role that you're planning to COVID response. Eric Green : Yeah, thank you Juan. Juan Avendano : Yeah. My first question is, what is the mix between FluroTec and NovaPure components that you're seeing being evaluated by the COVID vaccine players and any thoughts on the most likely packaging format, such as single dose or multi those and how many doses in that multi dose? Eric Green : Yeah, Juan, let me take these two questions. One is, in regards to FluroTec in NovaPure components primarily most of the interests with the \u2013 and again we have a pretty healthy participation rate with the number of companies working on a vaccine solution. In the vaccine area we're seeing more interest from FluroTec as the primary technology versus NovaPure. Now, there are certain situations where NovaPure is a better solution and customers have elected to go in that direction. But majority I would say is in FluroTec. In some of the therapeutics that we're working out whether already marketed or been labeled or expanded, that's using the combination mostly NovaPure and some FluroTec. In regards to the second part, that's a tough question where we stand today. As you think about how our customers are looking at vial configuration, whether it's one dose or multiple doses per vial. And it's a little bit uncertain at this point of time, but the way that we're mapped out all these opportunities with our customers, each one's a little different from a number of doses are the volumes that we're looking at would accommodate either one dose or multiple doses per volume. But at this point of time, I think it's pretty difficult to pinpoint exactly the number of doses per vial that our customers will be going with. Juan Avendano : Thank you. I appreciate the responses and the color there. And my second question is, we've seen a number of public announcements from Coronin, Silicon Oxide or SiO2 and ApiJect on the glass vial supply side for COVID-19. I would have expected to have seen something on Crystal Zenith from West. And so my short question is, what can you tell us about Crystal Zenith, how it compares competitively versus some of the other solutions out there that have gotten government grants for the COVID response? And what sort of COVID opportunities are you seeing for Crystal Zenith? Eric Green : Yeah, it's \u2013 we look at it a little differently. I think when you think about the preferred solution in the market right now is still glass. And so I know that the companies that are manufacturing glass are working on making sure they have the appropriate volumes, but I can't speak to them specifically. When you think about Crystal Zenith it's already a proven technology in the marketplace with a number of critical drugs specifically around the Biologics. And the demand that we have for Crystal Zenith is increasing. In fact, we are in process of increasing capacity in our Scottsdale, Arizona facility to address the increase around our one ml insert needle technology. We do see certain customers that require the Crystal Zenith technology in the areas of vaccine exploring that option. But I would say at this point, we have not got out and side government grants, frankly, I think our company as the market leader, we were leading from the front. And we're working with number of customers around the CZ technology. But I would say right now what it looks like is that the preferred solution on the immediate phase would be around glass. Juan Avendano : Great, got it. I'll leave it there, thank you and congrats once again. Eric Green : Thanks Juan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. You may proceed with your question. John Kreger : Thanks very much. Can you talk a bit more about your CapEx expansion plans? Are you \u2013 can we assume you're running sort of at full tilt at this point? Or do you have the ability to flex your output with your current configuration? And when can we expect the new capacity to come online that you talked about with the higher CapEx budget? Thanks. Eric Green : Yeah, John, what we have done is we decided to bring forward capital in regards to specifically equipment that will be placed strategically in three of our center of excellence sites of high-value products. We had this equipment earmarked for latter years based on trajectory of our current business and our current portfolio, but due to our discussions with customers, we are preparing to make sure that we will be able to address this surge that we'll see specifically around FluroTec stoppers in the marketplace. Now, in regards to the timing we're looking at towards the end of this year of having the capacity installed and validated. And we will be able to start the expansion of volume at that point in time. Bernard, do you want to talk a little bit more of the spec. Bernard Birkett : On the timing, John, some of the activity will be in at the end of this year and it's particularly related to FluroTec products and then we'll be layering in incremental capacity early on in 2021. And so all of the commitments that we have needed to put in place are actually in place with our equipment suppliers at the moment. So we'll have a phased introduction of that equipment, so it won't have any \u2013 it won't disrupt our business in any way. All of the equipment that we're ordering is replicating the equipment that we already have in place at West, so we're really set up well to make sure that we can onboard that equipment quickly and meet customer demand. John Kreger : Excellent and just to follow up to that, what sort of capacity boost will that give you for FluroTec, if you're willing to say? Eric Green : Yeah, we haven't revealed exactly the amount, but it's significant in the areas around FluroTec specifically. Bernard Birkett : Yeah. So based on all of the discussions we've had with customers and analyzing a number of different models, we believe that we will have sufficient equipment in place to meet any customer demand when it comes. John Kreger : Excellent, thanks very much. I guess one last one. Anything you can add on the sustainability of the pickup in growth in Contract Manufacturing? Bernard Birkett : Yeah, what's happening was the Contract Manufacturing really is around the diagnostics area and also injectables, auto injectors. And what we're finding is a lot of this is installed capacity that we've been ramping up for the last couple of years. We do see that the growth rate of high single digits to low double digits is more in line what we expect of Contract Manufacturing and it has been running a little bit stronger over the last several quarters. But on the other side, we continue to have discussions about future installed capacity of similar products. So we will see the second half of this year a little bit softer than the first half from a Contract Manufacturing perspective. But that's purely a comp issue. On the growth rates from a dollar perspective, we don't see any softening in contract manufacturing. And you connect \u2013 we see the revenue itself growing, but it would grow at a slower rate purely because of the comps that we're facing in the back half of the year. And you can see the positive impact that's having John on margins, where we were able to report 19%. Now, there were some onetime gains in there regarding certain engineering work that we were doing, which we would not expect to repeat in the second half of the year. But we forecast to see strong we think quarter-over-quarter growth when we compare to last year on the margin front. And this is something that we've been talking about for a while as we continue to improve the efficiencies and the utilization within the Contract Manufacturing network. And taking a lot of the learnings that we've had in Proprietary over the last number of years and really starting to implement those within Contract Manufacturing and so I would continue to see \u2013 expect to see margin expansion, but not to the levels of 19%. John Kreger : Great, thanks much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the nice acceleration. I wanted to ask a couple of questions around your COVID vaccine comments. We are hearing from some other vendors that are involved in the development whether it be in clinical trial space or maybe contract manufacturing space about the government's involvement in the overall funding or various governments I guess I should say, in the overall funding of these development activities and discounting as a result. And I guess I want to \u2013 you're clearly calling out FluroTec and NovaPure and you have for a little bit, are you getting or expecting to get full price on those volumes when they ultimately scale up and go commercial hopefully. Bernard Birkett : Yeah, Dave, our agreements with our customers are based on historic and current price points. So we are looking to obtain what we traditionally have received for those products. I realize that there's some funding going into certain manufacturing or R&D side, but we're not seeing the money really going into the percentage of COGS or the money going into the COGS to the supply base. So it's low. If you think about our products kind of on a configuration it could be anywhere between $0.15 to $0.35. If it's one dose or five dose, you can see how from a per dose perspective, it's not a significant percentage of the COGS. So I think we're well positioned and the expectations will continue with our policies around how we price according to the value we create, to support our customers. Dave Windley : So you anticipated where I might go next, Quintin may have tipped you off. I guess the curiosity that I have is that that historical argument has been one that that you've made, I've certainly made that the cost of these components as a percentage of \u2013 in most cases, a very high priced maybe even four figure per dose type price on a Biologic is a very, very small percentage. When we're talking about a price per dose that what some of these companies are promising that like $10 or if it's four or five dose per vial, it's maybe it's $40 or $50 of value is a very different equation than $1,000 dose Biologic How is it that the interest level or the sensitivity to that price is as low as it is or appears to be as low as it is? And I guess to spin the question the other way, if customers are able to get over that so easily in this environment, is that a signal that the adoption rate outside of COVID for high-value products should significantly accelerate because the price sensitivity is really as low as it is? Bernard Birkett : I can take the first part of the question, and maybe Eric might want to cover the second part of the question Dave. So just that we're clear, we have \u2013 we're not getting support from any governments. West is investing an extra $40 million, essentially this year in CapEx and even some into 2020. We've obviously \u2013 we're funding that ourselves. And when you look at, you're comparing the cost of our product to the end selling price. What we're saying is the cost of our product is a percentage of their COGS. So their COGS doesn't change, no matter what they sell the product at. The cost of producing is still the same. And we're still a relatively low part of that. And then if you work out the price per dose, potentially there could be five, 10 20 doses in a vial, where we sell one stopper per vial, so you got to divide back the cost of the stopper by the number of doses, so it becomes a really small part of the COGS. Regarding pricing, we haven't gone and tried to jack our prices in this whole process. We're maintaining the pricing essentially that we've had in place on many of these products. Now, pricing changes a lot of times regarding configuration. But I think that's the way to look at it rather than saying as a percentage of their price, if that's helpful for you and then the number of doses per vial. Eric Green : And Dave, when you think about our customers have been using our \u2013 they're using FluroTec or they're using NovaPure are very comfortable with it because they have user components on other molecules they have in the marketplace for other purposes, especially around Biologics. And so there's a comfort of think \u2013 when you think about how they can go-to-market fast, when you think about regulatory, you think about safety, think about quality and scale. And we have the scale, we can we can manufacture the volumes that we're speaking of in a very, very short period of time. So I think that's where that gives the customers confidence and comfort to continue to go after that part of our portfolio versus using the \u2013 dissipates extended product. So I'll stop there, but that's reason why we're seeing the demand in that area. Dave Windley : Okay and maybe a last question, in the news at least, I'm sure by numbers and perhaps the ones that don't get as much interest or press. The smaller companies are numerous, some of the highest profile of these players chasing the vaccine and the ones in Wall Street [ph], for example, I would think would be classified in your pharma segment. Can you speak to differences in growth rate that you're seeing, is that something perhaps as simple as timing as to where those inquiries and adoption rates and sampling demand might come from in regard to again, like you know, just to name a couple of the AstraZeneca's and J&J's of the world that are in this vaccine Chase. Eric Green : Yeah. No, Dave, when you think about whether it's small or large because of the nature of the molecule, we classify that as Biologic. Yes. So when we talk about vaccines, we're all encompassing. I won't try to split out the vaccine opportunities between the three units from our performance perspective. Dave Windley : Got it, okay. All right, very good. Thank you. Eric Green : Great, thank you, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. You may proceed with your question. Larry Solow : Great, thanks, good morning, guys. Eric Green : Good morning Larry. Larry Solow : Good morning. A couple of follow ups, Eric, you mentioned that the $0.15 \u2013 the $0.35 per vial? Would that be just for FluroTec or what is that sort of range discussing and you mentioned some companies \u2013 some customers have chosen NovaPure, which I guess encompasses sort of all the HVPs. Is there anybody just choosing FluroTec and maybe would Westar also potentially get at that equation? Eric Green : Yeah, Larry, it does vary on what the final configuration and all the additional services we provide. That number that was referenced is more around the FluroTec portfolio versus NovaPure. NovaPure is higher. Larry Solow : Right, okay and the 19 million you guys referred to in the quarter, 19 in the quarter and the 60 million for COVID related revenue is that the full year number? Bernard Birkett : Yeah, that's the full year. Eric Green : And that's anticipated number Larry. Larry Solow : That is close to 19, okay. Eric Green : Yeah, that's the full year number about 60 million that we see right now. Larry Solow : Got it and I imagine some you'd mentioned a little bit on the therapeutic side perhaps that should be [ph] I guess. And then the vaccines, I guess, obviously, it's just very clarification of components and testing and whatnot. And then inevitably, if something is commercialized and scaled, then you would obviously remember as we grow a lot more is that the way we look at that. Eric Green : Yeah, Larry, the way I look at it. Yeah, I think you're right. It's the way we break it out. And the way we're looking at we don't give out the numbers, but we're very \u2013 we segment this so we understand what's around hospital enablement. So this is like the IV and blood tubes, you think about supporting therapies to get in the ICU and then therapeutic treatments which we have a very high participation rate because of our Biologics position. Those are really the key areas when you think about more near term and as we think about vaccines as we work with our customers, obviously, there is some element of providing product for trials, but that is obviously low volume. And therefore we don't \u2013 we can't \u2013 and it's very difficult to predict when and how much and by whom. So we're holding off at that at this point. But as we said in our capital investment is that we are going ahead to ensure that we have the capacity on hand by the end of this year so we can handle the surge, if it is as early as early 2021 or late 2020. Larry Solow : Got it and then the margins in the quarter sort of really demonstrates the power of the operating model with 37% and 20% operating. Was there anything unusual either? You called out a couple hundred Bps on the contract manufacturing side, was there anything else unusual in the quarter that could have benefited those margins? Bernard Birkett : Well, other than the piece on Contract Manufacturing that I called out Larry, all of the COVID related costs have been recorded in COGS. They're all included in that margin number. Though it's pretty clean other than the CMPs and I think the Contract Manufacturing piece \u2013 yeah, that's about it. And then within operating margin, I called out impairments of certain assets. And that's a one time. Larry Solow : Right and you took that out on the adjusted number, right or is that in the adjusted number too, the write off. Bernard Birkett : Sorry, I didn't \u2013 Larry Solow : Is the write off in your adjusted number? Are you adjusted out? Bernard Birkett : In the adjusted number, it's in there. Larry Solow : It is in there. Okay. Bernard Birkett : We didn't bust it out. Larry Solow : Okay. And then you mentioned some \u2013 the increased overhead, which impacted your margins a little bit. Was that \u2013 is that written refers to FluroTec and NovaPure or that costs [ph] that hasn't come online? Eric Green : Yeah. It's something else, I guess, right. Bernard Birkett : Well, yeah. Well, if there's costs around PPE, there's incremental costs and supporting a lot of the workforce at our plants. We've gone to split shifts, so we're obviously paying shift premiums to keep the plants up and running. And then also there was some incremental freight costs. Larry Solow : Right, okay, great, all right, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Eric Green : Thank you, Larry. Bernard Birkett : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for any further remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Josh.

I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into our Q3 results and raised 2020 guidance, I like to make clear the importance of our mission at West and the values that formed the pillars in which we operate. In today's uncertain environment what seems like a new set of challenges each day, we remain focused on two key priorities. Keeping our team members safe and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we jointly serve. Moving to Slide 5. West is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation of scale and resources. Our team recognized at the outset of the pandemic that need to increase production capacity. We were already supporting the growth trajectory of our base business and the future demand for our products required for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics meant that we needed to act quickly and decisively. To address the increase in demand, we brought forward planned capital investments and production capacity. Earlier this month, we installed new manufacturing equipment at one of our HVP sites to prepare for the future demand of FluroTec and NovaPure. As of this week, that capacity is operational and we have additional equipment being installed at a second HVP site with more installations planned in the coming months at other global sites. The strength of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the forward momentum we have built over time with our market led strategy and the One West team approach to satisfy market demand. Now turning to Slide 6. The disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business in our daily lives. West is no exception. Thankfully, the changes we have been making over the past several years, the way we do business have enabled us to address these disruptions from a position of strength. Customers come to West for a scientific and technical expertise, and this differentiates us in the market. Despite the pandemic, we continued to share our expertise through our enhanced knowledge center, webinars, published articles and technical presentations at virtual conferences. We have been investing in digital technology and automation with two objectives in mind, bringing new connected products to market, as well as enhancing the productivity of our operations at every level of the organization. While we're early in our digital journey, I would like to share a few examples of our recent success, starting with our manufacturing automation strategy. We made great strides over the past year and helping us to achieve continuous improvements and quality, safety, service and cost. For example, our St. Petersburg, Florida site has developed an automation process for robotically loading and unloading molding presses. This has considerably reduced idle production time associated with product changeovers and improved operating efficiency. And our Kinston site has automated molding, trimming, rinsing processes, which will drive higher quality and final product and greater efficiency gains. And I'm especially pleased with the team's agility in bringing forward the production capacity expansion, I mentioned earlier. A great deal of planning and engineering went into this initiative to help us meet our customers' requirements. On the digital front, we have just introduced West virtual, the future of customer interactions with a truly immersive, fully interactive online experience. We expect this tool to be a primary customer interface, even beyond the current pandemic. Turning to Slide 7 and our performance in the third quarter, our financial results remain strong. I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters continued in the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. We had over 18% organic sales growth in the third quarter, driven again by robust high value product sales, as well as sales in contract manufacturing. And we experienced solid growth in operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the third quarter. Similar to the second quarter, our base business had solid organic sales growth in the third quarter. We also had incremental sales associated with many COVID-19 development projects we are supporting for both therapeutics and vaccines. Specifically for vaccines, towards the back end of the quarter, we were asked by our customers to accelerate initial deliveries of components is more than offset continued sales decline of products associated with injectable drugs and treatments such as dental and elective surgeries that have been impacted negatively by the pandemic. As for guidance for the remainder of the year, we are confident that we're well positioned with the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with pandemic solutions. Therefore, we're raising our sales and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance and guidance. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review our updated 2020 guidance. First up, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20. We recorded net sales of $548 million, representing organic sales growth of 18.2%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $32 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. Excluding net COVID impact, organic sales grew by approximately 11%. Looking at Slide 9. Proprietary product sales grew organically by 20.3% in the quarter. High-Value Products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double-digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q3. Looking at the performance of the market units, Biologics market units delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit experienced high single-digit growth led by sales of Teflon stoppers and FluroTec components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $194.6 million in gross profit, $46.8 million or 31.7% above Q3 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 35.5% was a 310 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $103.9 million recorded this quarter compared to $70.1 million in the same period last year for a 48.2% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 19% was a 360 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 46% for Q3. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.02 in Q3, EPS grew by approximately 53%. Let's review the gross drivers in both revenue and profits. On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $77.1 million or 16.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $32 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $6.1 million or 1.3 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $8.7 million or a reduction of 1.9 percentage points. Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for Q3 2020, up from 32.4% in Q3 2019. Proprietary products third quarter gross profit margin of 40.8% was 260 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. The key drivers of the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were : favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies; and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Contract Manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% was 350 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $323.8 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $63 million compared to the same period last year, a 24.2% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $116.7 million, $27.9 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $790.6 million at September 30, 2020 was $73.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Accounts Receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory, mainly as a result of increasing safety stock. Our cash balance at September 30 of $519.4 million was $80.3 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong. Turning to guidance, slide 13 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $85 million. There is an estimated headwind of $4 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 14% to 15%. This compares to prior guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and growth of approximately 12%. We expect our full year 2020 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $4.50 to $4.55 compared to prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.25. As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand. CapEx guidance remains at $170 million to $180 million. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our revised guidance. Estimated FX headwinds on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.18 EPS impact from our tax benefits from stock-based compensation. So to summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our sales and EPS projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct or approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and EPS expansion. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. Before I close, I'm pleased to share that last evening we received FDA clearance for West to market our 20 millimeter Vial2Bag advanced product. The team is excited to bring this innovative product to the healthcare professionals. To conclude, there are many challenges ahead of us, but we're resolute in our mission focus systems and most importantly, the team to address these challenges. We see strengths in our core business and we're confident in our long-term growth strategy. Our market led strategies delivering unique value propositions to our customers. Our global operations network is able to flex and respond to the demand, while driving market leading service and quality. And our investments in digital technology and automation will continue to keep us on the forefront of the industry. We remain focused on delivering value to all our stakeholders on a sustainable basis and doing our part to support the healthcare industry as it works to resolve this global pandemic. On behalf of the team members at West, we continue to wish you well in the days ahead. Gila, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Juan Avendano from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Juan Avendano : Hello. Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter again West and everybody. My first question is, it seems like the net COVID related revenue the benefit that you've been seeing over the last couple of quarters in 3Q and 4Q is anywhere between 30 million and 35 million per quarter. Why would you or would you not advise against annualizing this quarterly ground rate in the out years? I'm talking about 2021 and beyond? Eric Green : Yes. Juan, well, first of all, thank you. And we look at Q2 is approximately 19 million; Q3 was roughly around 32 million net COVID impact. And a lot of that has been around our therapeutics and supporting therapies and in Q3 saw a little bit of demand regarding vaccines to support the vaccines. But until we have visibility as our customers get product that's approved for human use, we are not able to guide any further is particularly around the vaccines. So Bernard did mention that for the full year, we're looking at about $85 million net impact of COVID-19. That's just based on what we know today and what we have visibility off. Juan Avendano : Thank you. And would you be willing to give us the split in the third quarter between therapeutics and vaccines out of those 32 million, how much was attributable to vaccines? Eric Green : Yes. So it was \u2013 the majority of it was around therapeutics and that's still, what we're seeing, now we have seen towards the back end of the quarter, some customers pull some of their demand for vaccines forward a little bit, and we have been responding to those demands, but primarily in Q3 mainly around therapeutics and some vaccine and revenues. Juan Avendano : Got it. And within the vaccine revenue, is this vaccine revenue associated with clinical trial activity or with at West manufacturing activity? Eric Green : Yes. Well we don't comment on exactly what the stages are \u2013 how our customers are ramping up. So we just can't comment on exactly the use at this point in time. Juan Avendano : Got it. And my very last question, if I may. And the margin expansion, congratulations on the margin expansion that the gross margin expansion that you were seeing on the Contract Manufactured Products segment is been two quarters of high teens gross margin. My question is how sustainable is this? And given the comments that you had in your prepared remarks about around the digital and automation improvements that you're making operationally, that's the setup West to deliver more than 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in the upcoming years? Eric Green : So to answer your first question on contract manufacturing, as we called out in Q2 we have seen significant improvement. Some of the Q2 bump in margins was related to some one-time engineering revenues and the associated profitability we saw with those. Again, we did see further improvements in Q3, if I was to look out between now and the end of the year; I would think the margin maybe a little bit lighter than that or showing again significant improvements on previous years. And then as we roll forward into 2021 and beyond, I would start to see the 18% plus being more sustainable over the long-term. But I was when we're looking at Q4; I would dampen down expectations a little bit on that one. Juan Avendano : Okay. Got it. And in the out years, the 100 basis points upside to that, given the digital transformation, the good trends on the high value products and obviously the increased utilization in the CMO segment? Eric Green : Yes. On our long-term construct, we have continuously said that we're targeting 100 basis points plus improvement year-over-year. And we continue to make the investments to make sure that we can sustain that level of improvement over the long-term and digital is part of that. Juan Avendano : Thank you. I'll leave it with that. I'll follow-up offline. Thank you. Eric Green : Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Juan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Larry Solow : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Can you \u2013 you mentioned the Vial2Bag approval there at the end. Maybe just elaborate a little more on that, so that mean that the whole product line will be coming back in 2021? Eric Green : Yes. What's coming back is the 20 millimeter version of the Vial2Bag which is more \u2013 majority of the demand in the adjustable market. So we are now as we got the approval late last night in the mode of ramping-up and to reenter the market or enter the market with the new innovative product that we're very comfortable and confident on will be a really solid solution. When you start thinking about transferring vile drugs from vile into a bag situation environment. So, and at the bedside of a patient, so we're excited about this launch and we're ready to move forward and thankfully the FDA has supported us on this journey Larry Solow : And obviously, just to follow-up on Juan's questions and a very nice margin improvement. And you mentioned NovaPure and Envision, could you just speak to and all those are two of your highest margin products, I believe sort of give us like a global look. What penetration is of those two services compared to some of Westar and FluroTec and, how much room we got to run between the two? Eric Green : Yes. FluroTec is really kind of a foundational element. We start thinking about particularly in the Biologics area. So the FluroTec coating that is used on both stoppers and plungers. And so therefore as somewhat foundational and that is being, the demand is obviously increased due to the current pandemic. We started thinking about penetration of envision, which has continuously grow nicely and then NovaPure, which is the highest level quality product that we provide in the marketplace. And that is the \u2013 the adoption rate is starting to continue to \u2013 continues to accelerate. It is still less than 10% or frankly, less than 5% of our sales and proprietary, but the highest growth that we're seeing and what's really encouraging as you know, we have good visibility what's in the pipeline and what our customers are looking to use for primary containment. NovaPure is now becoming quite a, I call it a staples in the biologic space. So we anticipate strong growth in NovaPure not just near-term, but more long-term on the base business. And in addition to that, we sort of think about some of the vaccines are being looked at and being developed for COVID. We are seeing interest levels around NovaPure. Larry Solow : And you spoke to the, the increased capacity particularly on the NovaPure and FluroTec. I realized that acceleration is partially driven by the vaccine demand in the short run. How about in the long run, it's these vaccines are not here forever or there are other options for these vaccine providers. Do you run the risk of overhead or unused overhead absorption? They put some of this increased capacity? Eric Green : Larry, the capacity that we've added was already baked into our five-year strap plan. So really what we've done is accelerated that CapEx by probably two to three years. So that this is capacity we were going to add in any case and say a vaccine didn't happen and we all want vaccines to be successful, but if it didn't, there would be some cost to cover really in the short term, but that, it's perfectly within our capability to do that. So we don't see any, no specific risk with this. It's technologies that we already have in our business, and that we are running today. So it's really expanding the current technology base. So from that perspective, there's not a huge risk, and we would not see that capacity sitting there idle for, it within the medium to long-term, if that vaccines were not successful. Larry Solow : Got it. And then just last question, just to clarify, actually a clarification. You mentioned, I think you said 95 million now for COVID related... Bernard Birkett : 85. Larry Solow : 85, okay. So, up from 60, so that's 25, and I think you sort of reverted back a little bit on the FX impact by about another 20 or so, so that's about three quarters of your increase on your guidance and the rest, I guess is the base business. Bernard Birkett : Yes. And so we're seeing strong growth across all of the areas of our business with COVID and ex-COVID, if you look at the growth rates excluding COVID, we're at double-digit growth rates. So it's strong across all areas of the business, and we've been showing growth in each of the market units and contract manufacturing. Larry Solow : Got it. Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson from Stephens. Please go ahead. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Just maybe one question on COVID vaccines, I mean, in terms of customer demand, I don't think you experienced stocking earlier this year, just generally, but as we think about the ramp up of these vaccines, do you anticipate customers building up inventories ahead of a potential launch? Or should we anticipate this vaccine work being largely made to order? Eric Green : A lot of our businesses made to order, but we are in active discussion with several customers of if and when a vaccine is approved and how we can respond. So, I think, earlier in the prepared remarks, Bernard mentioned a little bit about inventory has increased and some of that is due to build on, on some components that\u2026 Bernard Birkett : That's our inventory, that's right inventory with the customer. Eric Green : And that was the customer, it's our own inventory as we prepare. So we're well positioned to be able to react quickly and meet the requirements that the customers have, we have agreed upon with our customers. So, again, we're made to order, so we'll be able to respond once those \u2013 if and when those approvals come. Jacob Johnson : Got it. And then maybe a bigger picture question. I mean, in this COVID environment, we're seeing a lot of healthcare move into the home setting. Maybe it's too soon on the drug delivery side, but are you seeing any uptick in interest in products like SmartDose or SelfDose? And is this a trend, do you think, that could maybe accelerate in coming years as we come out of COVID? Eric Green : Jacob, that's exactly one of the areas we're starting to have further discussions with our customers, in particularly a couple of the development agreements recently signed and it commenced on what the customers is exactly just referenced, ability to take it away from an infusion setting to a delivery device environment that SmartDose is capable of doing. Now, it does take time to ensure that it's compatible and we \u2013obviously works as required. And we're confident in that area, but these development agreements do take time to get through over the line. We're seeing a bolt mixture of new molecules in the pipeline, but also molecules that are already in the marketplace that using other types of modalities for delivery. Jacob Johnson : Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks for taking the questions. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead. John Kreger : Hi, thanks. Bernard, could you just expand a bit more on your comments about accelerated CapEx? When would we expect that that program to sort of come online? I think, you said one plant has come online already, but can you just give us a little bit more detail about when the other accelerated programs are coming on? And I'm curious if that is impacting your expense levels as well, obviously it's impacting CapEx, but are you \u2013 to what degree are you running sort of elevated spending through the P&L too? Bernard Birkett : Yes, so, we're onboarding the equipment as we speak and \u2013 each week and over the next coming weeks, we'll be layering in more. And as we move into 2021, we'll be layering in more capacity. There is some expense around us regarding some engineering support, validation support, but it's not overly material. As we've already commented that the equipment and the technologies are onboarding our technologies and equipment that we have used in the past. So it's not anything new for us. So we have the systems and the people in place already to be able to do that. So it's not overly material on our results at this point. John Kreger : Great, thanks. And then the net COVID benefit, can we assume that is mostly flowing through the biologics segment? Bernard Birkett : That's correct, biologics and then generics have seen some. John Kreger : Got it. Okay. And curious, obviously, you've gotten a really nice lift from the pandemic in terms of demand. Can you talk about sort of the non-COVID pipeline that you're seeing? And are you able to meet the underlying demand levels there? Are you having any capacity issues? Eric Green : No, you're absolutely right. In the last quarter, we had double digit growth on the ex-COVID in both \u2013 in proprietary, which is really the area that were impacting the most wood sparking units probably supporting the most. And when you think about the pipeline in our biologics businesses is very robust. So not just molecules that have been launched and continue to have higher uptake in the marketplace, but it's new molecules that are being developed and we have a very high participation rate also in biologics. So the underlying growth rate of the three market units continued to do quite well. And that does put, as you referenced, additional capacity pressures on our capabilities, but that's where these investments we're bringing in and we're able to quickly install, validate, and move it into operational productivity. So the underlying business and we believe that will continue to go forward as is based on our current participation rate on new molecules coming through the pipeline. John Kreger : Great, thanks. And just one last thing to clarify, can you remind us at what point in the drug development process are you typically getting engaged by the innovator? Is it preclinical or early stage clinical? Eric Green : It's preclinical. So, we're very early on and a lot \u2013 in many cases, if they're not using, as you know, we have a pretty high participation rate on many of our customers' drug portfolio. So if they're looking at moving away from some \u2013 an element or products that they're already using within other parts of their portfolio then we will obviously alter and move to a higher value product like NovaPure, but it's very early on with our customers. John Kreger : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Danlei Yan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Danlei Yan : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just have one that hasn't been asked already. As cash builds, how is \u2013 how are you thinking about prioritizing deployment of capital? Bernard Birkett : So, right now, we're focusing on making sure that we're adding the additional capacity, the required capacity that's needed, and you can see that we've increased or had increased our CapEx guidance. And that's in the short to medium term as we look at where we deploy capital in the future. Yes, we will look at M&A, but again we take a very disciplined approach to looking at that and how we deploy capital in that area based on what are the strategic objectives that we have and what incremental value cannot bring to our customers and how we will create value from those acquisitions and add stakeholder value. And so, we have a pretty robust constructs around the hurdle rates that we have to meet, but that is something that we have started to look at. And if we have any updates for you in the future, we'll obviously communicate those to you. The one thing that we are cognizant of is that we have a very strong and robust organic growth story and strategic plan in place. And our priority is to make sure that we continue to deliver on that and not get distracted. So, hopefully that answers your question. Danlei Yan : Great, thank you. And yes, it does. Operator : Thank you. I show no further questions in the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Julian. Thank you everyone for joining us on today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning and welcome to West's fourth quarter and full year 2020 conference call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. This morning CEO, Eric Green; and CFO, Bernard Birkett, will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present our financial outlook for the full year of 2020. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. West had an extraordinary year of success in the face of the biggest healthcare challenge of our generation, a record-setting year of sales and margins were driven by the base business demand of our components, devices and solutions as well as the accelerating demand for components associated with COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. This was accomplished by our dedicated team that was across the globe working tirelessly to show up each day at our facilities, our lab and remotely at their homes to make a meaningful difference to customers and patients. I want to begin by acknowledging these incredible effort and say thank you. Starting on Slide five of the presentation, the past year has truly brought to light the importance of our mission and values that guides our work each day at West. We remain steadfast in our purpose to serve society and lead by example for the communities in which we live and work. Importantly, we continue to manage through these unprecedented times by focus on two key priorities; one, keeping our team members safe and two, ensuring uninterrupted supply of high quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we jointly serve. The criticality of our business today is shown in the character and the perseverance of our team members to deliver on our commitments as a trusted partner for our customers. The strength of our performance this past quarter and throughout 2020 demonstrates the forward momentum that we have built over time with our market-led strategy, globalization of our manufacturing network and one West team approach to satisfy market demand. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2020 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth and by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and contract manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways and finally, we'll review our 2021 guidance. First up Q4, our financial results are summarized on Slide 11 and the reconciliation of non-US GAAP measures are described in Slide 20 to 23. We recorded net sales of $580 million representing organic sales growth of 19.8%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $46 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volume due to the pandemic. Looking at Slide 12, proprietary product sales grew organically by 25.1% in the quarter high-value products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q4. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 17, we have a critical role to support our customers as we work to resolve this global pandemic. The participation rate remains very high and our products are being used in this battle. We have strengths in the underlying core business and long-term growth. Our focus on execute, innovate and grow allows us to be more responsive to the changes in the industry. Our market-led strategy is delivering the right products and solutions to our customers. Our global operations network continues to flex and respond to increased demand and capacity requirements and our investments to fuel R&D innovation in digital technology will continue to keep us on the forefront of the industry. The future is promising, but most importantly, we remain grounded by our mission and values each day at West because every component has a patient's name on it. Catherine, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator :   Our first question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Great. Good morning, guys and congrats on great quarter and year in a tough environment and thanks for taking my questions as well. May be first question,, can you maybe just give us a little more color just on the COVID expectations I think did about $100 million of stake in 2020 maybe a little less, about $250 million or $260 million for this coming year. Can you just give us a breakout, is it -- are you seeing more on the vaccine side, you mentioned some customers are using, it sounds like most are using FluroTec on the vaccine side. Some are looking at NovaPure. Can you give us a higher level maybe just a mix and any color you can add to that will be great? Eric Green : Thank you, Larry and I appreciate the question. When we started this journey I'd say in the end of Q1 early Q2 of 2020, the primary focus at that point from revenue was more around the diagnostics and a few therapeutics that are being approved for COVID-19 and if you look at the tail end of 2020, it started to flip more towards vaccines and as we move into 2021, you'll see most of -- going from as you said little less than $100 million of the revenues associated with COVID-19 in 2020, our guidance was $260 million approximately for 2021 majority of that will be vaccines related and our participation is very high and the types of solutions that we're bringing to the customers tend to be around FluroTec and in some cases the NovaPure in addition to products that it fills . So that's the transition that you'll see in the mix of type of revenues to support the COVID-19 solution and that aligns up very nicely to the investments we made with additional capital equipment and our facilities to support the increase in demand that we have visibility for several quarters ahead of us. Larry Solow : Okay. And it sounds like I know you said you've accelerated, you talked to us for a couple of quarters, the investment into NovaPure and Westar and FluroTec. Is that the acceleration or the continued acceleration that looks like going into 2020 -- 2021, excuse me, is that sort of ahead of where you thought you might have been even a quarter ago in terms of the outlook for this year spending wise? Eric Green : Well no, we were actually slightly ahead of schedule of implementation and the teams has done a phenomenal job working with their suppliers and being innovative and getting the materials into our sites or the equipment and then obviously the validation process. So they've been working literally around the clock as many companies are doing to get these lines up and running and validated, but the reality is that the new equipment we installed, we didn\u2019t have a lot of revenues associated to those in 2020 that started pickup in 2021. There is additional equipment that is scheduled in the first half of this year, which is on track and then also within line that we originally talked about prior to capital expenditures. So we're comfortable where we are and further conversation with customers gives us confidence that we're planning accordingly looking at current demand and potentially future demand. Larry Solow : And it looks like the back of the envelop it's about 10% growth excluding like we take our COVID from 2020 and 2021 and I guess that's excluding the current benefit I guess that sort of puts you in line with your sort of 6% to 8% organic growth targets excluding the COVID related sales and that's about in the ballpark. Bernard Birkett : That's correct Larry, so we still see a lot of strength within the core business and Eric kind of alluded to in his comments also, he felt that's throughout 2020 and we continue to see that as we move through 2021 and then you have the COVID vaccine on top of that. Eric Green : You're in the ballpark there. So that continues to be pretty much in line with our long-term construct. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Avendano with Bank of America. Your line is open. Juan Avendano : Thank you and congrats on the quarter. According to my calculations or a mix there was any customer reclassifications among the customer segments, generics grew about 42% year-over-year and I'd suppose that all of this non-COVID related. Can you confirm with me whether or not this is correct and what drove this significant step up? Eric Green : Generics was I think high single-digits already double-digits, some are already getting 42%. Juan Avendano : I'll check my math on that. And then can you give us an idea about the backlog of committed orders as of the end of 2020? Eric Green : When we look at the backlog, I'll say that it's stronger than it was in prior-year and the mix of it is more towards the high-value products. The other aspect of the order book is that we're having great success with customers having longer visibility so that we have better opportunities to plan accordingly in our manufacturing processes. So yes, it's a stronger order book, the mix is more towards our high-value product components and we do have longer outlook and obviously on top of that, that's our core business on top of that, you have the vaccines in addition to visibility of what we are responded to over the next several quarters. Juan Avendano : Thank you. And I guess that there has been some evolving changes that could happen on the COVID vaccine packaging configurations. Pfizer is now squeezing six doses out of this five dose vial and Moderna might be considering putting 14 doses and supposed to 10 by doing some configurations. Have you taken to accomplish potential changes in the packaging configuration in your COVID-19 revenue guidance? Eric Green : That's all been taken into consideration with our guidance and so there is two ways of looking at it and it's great that we're able to get more doses per vial to build to respond globally as quickly as possible. Whereas you think about long-term there's obviously future opportunities as you think about moving down to single used vial and/or prefilled syringe which potentially could become a preferred solution long-term. So we take all that into consideration. We feel good about where we are with our capacity and our capabilities and also we're engaged with a dialogue about what does this look like long-term. Juan Avendano : Thank you. And then before I get back into the queue, I guess on the contract manufactured products, do you plan to add capacity in 2021 and is there a chance for that segment not to actually deliver double-digit growth in 2021 unless you add capacity? Eric Green : We've been talking about the growth in contract manufacturing for a while. We've seen that -- we'll gravitate towards mid-single-digit growth and it wouldn't be at the double-digit growth where we've seen over the last number years, just given the nature of that business. We continue to invest and it's part of our CapEx forecast for 2021 and there is a number of growth initiatives in that area and what we have been communicating that the growth rate will become more in line with our overall construct. And I think if you look at Q4, the Q4 number, the absolute dollars was pretty consistent throughout the year with contract manufacturing. It just came up against a really big comp in Q4. So the percentage growth rate looked a little bit lighter than the previous quarters. But from a dollar perspective it's pretty much in line with where we have expected to be and where we have communicated it will be, but we continue to invest in that part of our business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul Knight : Could you talk to I think Bernard, you mentioned that there is negative COVID effect. Could you qualify that and is it possible to even quantify how much headwind you had in your past results? Bernard Birkett : We haven\u2019t really broken it, but we're concentrating on given the net impact to our business, but it's really been in animals health and some in dental, which those two areas are within our Pharma market unit. That's where we feel some slowing down. It wasn't overly material for us and then I think there was some elective surgeries as well that will impact us, but nothing drastic that I would have to call out. Paul Knight : Right and then Eric as you look at these capital expenditures, do you have flip trend that you can just turn around and done quickly or do you have to go from greenfield sites I guess ultimately, how quickly does this come online? Eric Green : Very quickly, Paul. The work that has been done by the team over the last couple years for globalizing the operations and as you know we moved from 29 plants to 25 plants has enabled us to think about future growth, leverage our existing assets. So it's a very short turnaround. The longest part of the lead time is around getting the equipment built and then there's always validation process associated to that, but all these equipments being put into existing facilities. Paul Knight : Okay. And then lastly, Eric you in your progress on your goal of extreme if I call it that from when you started, are you halfway there, are you full way there or what's your view on what you wanted to accomplish when you arrived? Eric Green : There's a lot more to do Paul. I honestly believe we're in a very good position to leverage not just what we built today, but what we can do tomorrow for our customers. We're holding the conversations or beyond our current portfolio. We have more work to do on globalization of the enterprise. We have great opportunity to move towards more digital. I am extremely pleased on how the team implemented as for Hana during this pandemic in a virtual environment globally and that's a quite a test and that was done with our internal digital technology center out of our Bangalore site. So you hear by my tone that I think there is a lot of opportunity for us to really have a more meaningful impact on patients and they will support our customers as they move towards new innovative solutions and particularly around the biologic space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Your line is open. Jacob Johnson : Maybe first following up on Paul's headwind question, as things hopefully reopen kind of falling the vaccine, people return to the doctor and then I guess take their pets to the veterinarian, have elective surgeries. Could there be upside to your expectations around growth in 2021 kind of ex-COVID? Eric Green : It's very open ended question, as those things happened, yeah ideally we would say there will be some level of upside where we're focused on delivering within the construct and the guidance that we've given now and making sure that we're able to deliver on that vaccine demand to get everything back to normal and then if other markets open up, we will have the capacity in place to be able to serve those also. Jacob Johnson : And then on COVID work, can you talk about where you're seeing demand from these COVID vaccines and therapeutics by geography? Is this largely focused on opportunity in the US and Europe or is this a situation where there could be opportunity in Asia-Pacific as well. Eric Green : Global, so some of the firms, obviously the ones that are proven in the market right now for emergency use, they are not just in the United States but they are partners in other regions of the world and so we enforced because of our position and our assets are global, we're able to support them. So if they decided to do internally and go externally with a partner, we're there to support them with their primary containment solutions. So we're seeing, if you think about it, in Asia there's probably a little more prefilled syringe demand in the market particularly in China, in Europe and in Asia is pretty consistent on the vial configurations, and it's consistent product, that we provide throughout all these customers; the FluroTec coating is primarily the main driver. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is open. John Kreger : I had a question obviously at the beginning of '20, you weren\u2019t thinking about COVID demand. How have you been able to handle your non-COVID work? Have you had to sort of defer that underlying order flow or have you been generally able to keep up with the sort of typical non-COVID orders? Eric Green : In general, we've been able to keep up however, I would say there are times where we had to engage with our customers to identify if we had to risk -- pivot respond to particular our COVID order, how we work with our customers since we're made to order and our customers have been very supportive, for the most part we've been able to respond. I just put it in context, just in our proprietary business, we do over 30 billion components a year. So when you think about the demand that we're putting on our operations with the additional demand for COVID solutions, it's meaningful, but it's not over taxing the global operations. John Kreger : And then maybe corollary to that, as you work with clients kind of upstream and their pipeline work, are you getting the sense that some of that work has been back burn base as they strength to meet the COVID challenges or again has the normal flow of non-COVID work been pretty stable in terms of the development process? Eric Green : It's interesting, we're finding if you look in the mirror a little bit, it was approved by the FDA in 2020 versus 1918 where you'll find is pretty -- somewhat consistent, which is interesting because we do work with certain customers that might be of particular delay in clinical trials and so forth but we're seeing a relatively stable, consistent pattern as we speak today. And on top of that, we look at our participation rate, it remains equal if not better if you just and that's taking the vaccines out of the equation. On the core business, we're seeing very strong participation rates. So we're not seeing too much of a deviation what we've seen in the last couple of years. John Kreger : And then one last one, can you just remind us why generics tends to grow notably faster than pharma and as you look out 2021 or 2022, do you think you'll see the same trend or a little bit more of a normalization of those two buckets? Eric Green : There is two comments and maybe Bernard if you want to add, but the first one is if you think about where we started with on this market led approach, it became apparent when we started a few years ago that the generics market unit was a lower market share amongst the three. So we had a greater opportunity to capture more share just by simply repositioning new portfolios like AccelTRA that are very attractive to that segment. And the other aspect just to remind of is the pharma business includes dental, includes that -- includes other ancillary segments outside of just branded small molecule and therefore, you'll see a little bit more of a softness in that business, but we're seeing the number of ANDAs continue to be very strong, which is what drives the generics business for West. I don\u2019t know Bern if you want to add any comment to that. Bernard Birkett : It's been capsulated, it's our market share is different within those two market units and there's more room for us to grow within generics and they're essentially put the market units in place. It allows us to focus in on that area and start to grow our business within generics and that continue to be the case and there is still -- we still have a pathway forward to continue that accelerated growth and then we're introducing new products also to help us to get more entrenched with the generics market space. John Kreger : Great. Thanks and maybe just one last one, the COVID contribution that you quantified for '21, as you think about longer-term planning, do you view that as sort of durable or more of a bolus that will likely decline in '22 and '23? Bernard Birkett : Well, one of the things that we've looked at is the mix of our COVID-related business and as Eric said earlier, it started out more on the diagnostics therapeutics, I guess we went through the first half and the first call it three quarters of 2020 and that more become larger within vaccines and we have been communicating that we felt the vaccine will be where West would see the biggest opportunity for us and that's reflected in our 2021 guidance. So it's really how does the vaccine play out over the next number of years, what sort of booster shots will be required. So that's how we're trying to frame us and believe that into our planning. So it is obviously how does that vaccine market develop over the next number of years and will boosters be required, but that's primarily what we're participating right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dave Windley : Thanks to your team as well, I hope to get the vaccine soon, so we're all one of the patient. So thanks for their hard work. I was hoping probably have a series of clarifications. So in your COVID vaccine or excuse me, your COVID contribution to '21 as I am listening to you describe how that has kind of evolved in the last quarter or so, should I interpret that the 100 million of kind of base in '20 stays in that same mix and the vaccine is the 160 contribution on top of that or does most of the 260 actually then become vaccine as we move into '21? Eric Green : Yeah it's primarily the growth we see within the vaccine segments. As we said there was a lot on the therapeutics within 2020 and the early part where we try to figure out how to treat this thing and then that shift is the -- as we got into the latter part of the year until now more the focus is around vaccines for us and there is some within therapeutics, little bit in diagnostics, but it's primarily vaccine related. Dave Windley : And then to Jacob's question on global and your answer there, it sounds like your clients are making high-value product choices globally. Did I understand that correctly or are you seeing downshift to standard in say developing economies things like that? Eric Green : We're seeing consistency Dave around our high-value products particularly on FluroTec and characteristics of the vaccine, their molecule itself. So we're not seen any reduction I guess if you want to call that from the high-value product portfolio. So it truly is HVP globally. Dave Windley : Sure that sounds great. In terms of then broadening out from COVID, is this experience is the last year and the ability to kind of I'm sure clients are familiar with these products, but your ability to respond quickly to clients to ramp up your capacity for these high-value products, is that stimulating higher adoption of high value in the non-COVID opportunities with these clients? I was just wondering what kind of knock-on effect that my create in your conversations with clients? Eric Green : Yeah if you look at our biologic portfolios, we have a very high participation rate there. So that tends to be primarily a runner for FluroTec platform, but to your point, we are seeing an acceleration conversation around NovaPure because now -- because of scale and a greater understanding of the characteristics of the primary packaging containment. So as they look at vaccine that will spill over to more of a platform approach going forward, that's how we see it and that's why we're continuously building and pushing for helping our customers get to that NovaPure conclusion with our new molecules that they're working on. Dave Windley : Interesting so that kind of segues into my last question, which is can you give us some sense, I think two or three years ago and really throughout this period of time, we talked about high-value product as a percentage, but within high-value product you obviously have many tears NovaPure at the higher end, can you give us a sense of how the mix has shifted within high-value product from Westar at the entry level and NovaPure at the high level? How does that evolution look if we could see that detail? Eric Green : Yeah we don't give up the exact numbers for each area, but what you would see if you look at -- if you recall that a while ago, we showed a spectrum of all the high-value products from whereas we said Westar all the way up to NovaPure. What you're seeing is the higher growth and now it's higher dealt on revenue is the upper right-hand side versus the lower right -- lower left side. So to your point, we are seeing that adoption, we certainly see the volume and as you know that our business, it takes a while to get that adoption and then build it into the platform of our customers. So the higher growth is in the upper hand side of that spectrum. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Quintin Lai for any closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Catherine and thank all of you for joining us today -- on today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand today's conference over to your speaker Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to West's first quarter 2021 conference call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Starting on slide 5. I am pleased to report that we had an exceptional first quarter. This was driven by strong organic sales growth in both our base business and the accelerating demand for products associated with COVID-19. Our high-value products continue to fuel increased gross and operating margins. Together this has resulted in record EPS for the first quarter. The strength of our performance is demonstrated in our ability to execute the market-led strategy, leverage the power of our global manufacturing network and rally as a one West team to meet the increased market demand. I am proud of how our team members have focused on our priorities and emphasize the importance of our purpose and values during these times. Turning to slide 6. We have highlighted the key drivers of growth in Q1. We continue to see strong uptake of HVP components, including Westar, FluroTec, Envision and NovaPure offerings as well as Daikyo's Crystal Zenith. Bernard Birkett : Thank you Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics pharma and generic market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance. First up Q1. Our financial results are summarized on slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-US GAAP measures are described in slides 17 to 20. We recorded net sales of $670.7 million, representing organic sales growth of 31.1%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $102.9 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. Eric Green : Operator : Thank you.  And your first question is from the line of Juan Avendano of Bank of America. Juan Avendano : Hi, hello good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. I guess my first question was\u2026 Eric Green : Thank you Juan. Juan Avendano : Thank you. My first question was as we think about the pediatric and then potentially the booster opportunity one of the most significant comments that you made on the call, which confirms one of our ideas was the ratio of packaging components to dosages perhaps being a little bit more on one-to-one than versus the initial roll out. And so can you elaborate on the visibility on perhaps -- that you have on the packaging configuration for boosters in the future and how you see that opportunity evolving? Eric Green : Yeah. Juan you're absolutely correct when you state that there's -- we're in discussions with our customers as they look at the various forms of delivery. And there is a -- obviously we're involved with discussions about smaller units of doses per vial and/or moving towards the prefilled syringe, which in our business that would have an impact on the volume that we would produce and support our customers, hence the -- some of the investments that we're currently making. The second thing I'll -- and that will evolve Juan over the -- if you think about over the next several quarters is there's a lot -- there's still a lot of moving parts. I think secondarily to that we do have visibility of demand around the vaccines that's pushing into the 2022 time line. So we feel really good about where we are, but we know that we need to continue to see -- pivot if necessary as the number of doses per unit changes because it will require a slightly different product configuration. Juan Avendano : Thanks. I appreciate that. And how would you characterize the inventory management trends across your COVID-19 vaccine customers specifically. Do you have any concerns about customers stocking up on inventory of packaging components any pull-forwards that you see, or would you say that your current sales are pretty well-aligned with the pace of vaccine distribution? Eric Green : Yes. Juan, within the vaccine distribution our pace is well in line. In fact, we are engaged with the companies that have vaccines in the market, but also the firms that are working on development of gaining the approvals to be into the market shortly and those are on a regular basis, so we can stage our demand whether it's weekly or monthly as we go forward. But, I'm pleased on the team's response and we're able to keep up with the demand where we sit today. Juan Avendano : All right. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. I\u2019ll leave it there for now. Appreciate, you come back again. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Paul, your line is open. If you mute, please unmute. Paul Knight : Hi. Can you hear me? Eric Green : Yes. Hi, Paul. Paul Knight : Hey. How are you? Question on -- are you seeing orders on COVID-related products into 2022 yet? I mean what's their duration they want to look into at this point, Eric? Eric Green : Yes. Paul, when we look at our order book, roughly one-third of it is COVID-related and it is extended into 2022. So obviously of what we're doing today, but the visibility we have is going into the following year. Paul Knight : Okay. And then, how are you running on capacity at facilities globally? Are you hitting any ceilings yet, Eric? Eric Green : Well, that's -- we are -- in certain areas, we're getting close to that capacity level. Obviously, as you know, we're running 24/7 multiple facilities, particularly around our high-value products. However, we're layering in various capital investments. The first wave is -- will be completed in the next number of months. And that is -- gives us significant lift around our HPP, and we have another wave coming in over the next six to 12 months. So, we're keeping up but it does require the installation, validation and moving to commercial production immediately with this new equipment we have online. Paul Knight : And then lastly, on the core biologics demand, ex COVID, obviously seems to be accelerating. Could you talk to that and what your outlook is there? Eric Green : Well, that's an area of excitement. I mean obviously a lot of areas within our company. But in the biologics area, it's a combination of two things. One is the number of new molecular entities being approved and our participation rate continues to be very, very strong. And I'm pleased on how our teams are responding and supporting our customers, particularly in this time of -- during the pandemic. Also we're starting to see a -- the volume increase on a number of the biologics that have been recently introduced in the marketplace ramping up, and therefore, the volume component on existing molecules in the marketplace, we're seeing additional growth there. One last comment I'll add, just because we're seeing really good strong growth in biosimilars in our Asia Pacific region. So it's a combination of multiple aspects, Paul. And this is a very bright spot for us outside of the COVID conversation of our core base business. Paul Knight : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. John, your line is open. If you mute, please unmute. John, your line is open. Eric Green : Good morning, John, you there? No. Operator : We\u2019ll move to the next question. Our next question is from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I guess my first question is just on guidance. If I annualize your first quarter revenues, I get to something above your guidance for the year. What puts or takes could there be in the future quarters that would result in revenues being below this first quarter or maybe more simply just any seasonality you'd call out this year as we think about modeling? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So we called out in the prepared comments there was a one-timer in there approximately -- just close to about $12 million, which related to some cancellations that we had in there. And that was a one-time fee that we were able to recognize. So, that -- and that was primarily around COVID. So you got to back that out, when you're putting the run rate together. And I think that gets you pretty close to our guidance. Jacob Johnson : Got it. That makes sense, Bernard. Thank you. And then, a question, it seems like a lot of these COVID vaccines are using FluroTec or NovaPure. Is the decision there just based on customer preference, or are there any particular types of vaccines that require NovaPure versus FluroTec? Eric Green : Yes, the types of vaccines that are in the market right now do require that barrier coat which is -- which we and our partner Daikyo, are very well known for in the industry with the -- what we call the FluroTec, so fluoropolymer barrier. And that -- so that has become the standard in the industry. And therefore, we're seeing that adoption obviously with the types of vaccines that are in the marketplace and/or the ones that are being developed as we speak. In some cases, we're leveraging our NovaPure offering, because our customers want that assurance of the highest quality product in the marketplace. So those are the key drivers of that decision. It's around the science and the technology than anything else. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ll leave it there. Eric Green : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line Dave Windley with Jefferies. Dave Windley : Hi. Good morning. More than thank you for the work you're doing -- your organization is doing to get vaccines in arms, on more recipient. And Eric, congrats on the ESG focus that you've put on we noticed in our work that you're very, very highly rated in ESG, despite what I would think would be some business model headwinds to overcome in that regard, so congrats on that. My question is around your HVP, I appreciate you guys always give the market unit growth. It makes me smile to hear, Bernard emphasize strong double-digits in the context of a 30% top line growth. I suspect it, it's very strong. I wondered -- I may strike out on this, but I wondered if you guys would be willing to give maybe a little bit more precision about what strong double-digits means. Again, with 30% top line growth, could be a three-handle, four-handle, five-handle, I'm just wondering if you might give us a little bit more precision about where those growth numbers are landing by market unit? Eric Green : Yeah. I'll start Dave, if you don't mind. And then -- so first of all, thanks for the comments. It takes the entire organization value behind the ESG. But that's part of the DNA of West for many, many years. In regards to HVP, you're absolutely correct, majority of the incremental growth that we're experiencing here at West, particularly in the last quarters, but as we look forward is within the HVP portfolio. We tried to highlight that, we're excited and encouraged by the uptake of the higher end of that range. And as you know has a more attractive economic profile for West. And not to say, it has a phenomenal performance for our customers, from a value proposition. But we're seeing over -- about over two-thirds of our growth coming in the high-end of our HVP. And so if you can kind of think about -- do the math from there you get to that number you referenced of 30%. It's a very, very strong growth. In the walls of West, we don't really talk about the percentages in these two lines like, NovaPure. We talk about the number of units and how can you double or triple that portfolio, in a very short period of time. So, it's about as much context I can give on this. Bernard, if you have any... Bernard Birkett : Yeah. I'd rather keep it the way, we've been reporting today, but you can produce that a lot of -- we're seeing a lot of strong growth in biologics. And biologics is primarily high-value growth product. And -- but we're also seeing this in generics and pharma, but not to the same extent, but primarily all of biologics is high-value product growth. Dave Windley : Got it. So maybe that was a foul ball. I didn't completely miss the ball. But In terms of your \u2013 Eric, your commentary on the high-end, just to be specific, you're talking NovaPure the very highest one, or are you talking about a couple? Eric Green : I'm talking about -- that's a good point, Dave. So I'm talking about from FluroTec vision all the way\u2026 Dave Windley : Okay. Eric Green : \u2026 up to NovaPure. Dave Windley : Got it, got it. And then, maybe another way to come at this is on the margin front. So going back years, we've talked about high value, as an overall bucket being -- generating gross margins probably north of 50% versus standard maybe 30% or lower. Would you be willing to comment on, kind of the overall gross margin in high value and how that evolves as the product demand moves up into the higher-end of your high-value product portfolio? Bernard Birkett : Yeah. So going back to your last comment as well, if you look at where we're investing and where a lot of our CapEx -- the incremental CapEx is going. It's going to products like around FluroTec and NovaPure. So it is tracking to the higher end of high-value products and to support that. And that -- now you're starting to see that come through. And you can even see it in the margin expansion that we experienced here in Q1 with proprietary, I think over 40% gross margin, that's probably for the first time, that we've seen that, it helps a little bit by that one-timer. And that we called out on those COVID-related agreements that we had to account for. But you're getting north of 50% on the margins now. And it -- as we progress, based on the investments that we've made and the growth that we see that that should continue. This all feeds into the long-term construct that we've rolled out there. And that's why we continue to have confidence in that that, we are able to continuously expand gross margins and operating margins and all of this feeds in. So that has been part of the narrative for a long-time. And now, you're seeing it come to fruition on a continuous -- on a more sustainable basis, Stephanie, go ahead. Dave Windley : Thank you. I will drop back in queue again. But thanks for the answers. I appreciate it. Bernard Birkett : Thanks, Dave. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Quintin. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Stephanie. And we apologize to John Kreger at William Blair for his technical -- having technical issues. And we'll sort that out later. Thank you for joining us on today's conference call. An online archive of the broadcast will be available on our website at westpharma.com, in the Investors section. Additionally, you may access a replay through Thursday, May 6 by using the dial-in numbers and conference ID provided at the end of, today's earnings release. That concludes this call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Erica. Good morning, and welcome to West's second quarter 2021 conference call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the Company's website located at westpharma.com. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Starting on Slide 5, I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter of growth. This was driven by strong organic sales in both our base business and the accelerating demand for products associated with COVID-19. Our high-value products, coupled with productivity gains, continue to feel expanding gross and operating margins. Together, this has resulted in significant EPS growth for the second quarter. The strong performance demonstrates the criticality of our business as the market leader in primary packaging of injectable drugs and is a testament to the foundation we have built over time with our market-led strategy, globalization of our manufacturing network and our One West team approach, which is bringing meaningful benefits to our customers to support patient health. We continue to manage through the challenges of the pandemic with focus on our key priorities of team member safety and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices. I am proud of our team across the globe for their dedication to customers, patients and most importantly, to each other as we have met the demands of our business. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and pharma market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance. First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-US GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20. We recorded net sales of $723.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 30.6%. COVID net related revenues are estimated to have been approximately $117 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. Summarized on Slide 14. Our mission to improve patient lives drives our passion to provide leading-edge, primary containment and delivery technology for our customers. Our market-led strategy is delivering as evident in our leading participation rate in new approvals and our role in support of COVID-19. Our global operations team is executing with the efficiencies and improvements in service and quality to meet increased demand, and we're continuing to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. In summary, the first half of the year has been exceptional. We remain well positioned with the strength of our core business and are confident in the long-term horizon of continued organic sales growth and margin expansion. We are proud to be the trusted partner for our customers across the globe and ensure the safe delivery of treatments to patients. Erica, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Paul Knight : What's your view on COVID vaccine demand in the year 2022? And is the technical requirements on containment as high as other high-value products? Eric Green : Yes, Paul, good morning, and thanks for joining. Yes, we have good visibility into 2022, and some of the recent comments regarding capital expansion is driven - a portion of that is driven by future demand. What you're seeing with our portfolio of the chosen configuration for a lot of these file configurations, sorry, is our NovaPure or FluroTec solution. So it tends to be mid to the higher end of our HVPs. There is - obviously, we're in discussion with customers as they are determining if there's going to be less dose per vial or move towards a prefilled syringe and also the conversation around potential boosters. So there is many still moving parts, but when you think about the next 12, 18, 24 months, we have a clear visibility of what we need to deliver to support the demand on hand. Paul Knight : And secondly, if you look in the - you, obviously, with your stability trials have a look into other biologics. Would it be fair to say, we continue to see acceleration in potential biologic approvals? Eric Green : Yes. What's exciting there is that not only the pipeline is rich, if you think about the more recent approvals that have been granted around the biologics or biosimilars, our participation remains extremely high. And the other indicator that gives us great confidence is, we start thinking about our confirmed order book. If you think about the incremental, which is significantly up, it's really broken in different areas, the biologics leading the charge for the majority of that, and it's around HVP. So we're quite confident of the future growth of the pipeline. Operator : Your next question is from Juan Avendano with Bank of America. Juan Avendano : My first question is, given the COVID revenue that is embedded in your guidance, and we know that about more than 3.5 billion doses have been administered - vaccine doses year to date. It seems - and also knowing what the ASPs are for the packaging components, it might seem like the NovaPure mix perhaps is higher than or is greater than a majority by FluroTec. Would you agree with that notion or not? And also on the COVID therapeutics, are you seeing more NovaPure than FluroTec? Eric Green : Yes. So what we're seeing - Juan, thanks for the question. So if you think about the COVID solutions that we're providing, from a unit perspective, FluroTec is actually much higher than the NovaPure, but we're seeing good growth in that area. But if you think about the new therapeutics that have been approved or in process through approval, it tends to be more towards the NovaPure. But when you translate from a revenue perspective, yes, NovaPure is becoming one of our top drivers of growth in our Proprietary business. Juan Avendano : Thank you. Yes. That's the way the math seems to point. Okay. My second question is, can you talk about the ordering patterns that you're seeing from customers? Some biopackaging tools companies such as Sartorius have noted that they're seeing customers place orders further in advance. And so are you seeing the same dynamic? And are you concerned at all that this might create a demand gap sometime in the future when business trends normalize? Eric Green : So Juan, one of the major pushes that we've had in the last couple of years is really the visibility into our customers' supply chain, and we've done a really good job leveraging some of our digital tools we deployed here within West. That gives us confidence that the demand that we are seeing is more in line with the demand of the pull within the marketplace. So said differently is, yes, we're seeing more confirmed orders that are further out, but that also - we're also seeing that the increase on the number of orders more near term is also increasing. So the confirmed order book has grown significantly, but the combination of more longer-term visibility, but also pure organic growth more near term. Juan Avendano : Thanks. And my last one before I get back in the queue. You alluded to this in the previous questions, but I mean, would you feel at this point as customers and sponsors are evaluating, the potential migration to a COVID packaging configuration that is smaller. Fewer dose vials or even prefilled syringes, do you think that, that change is more imminent now than in the last quarter? How are those thoughts going and how feasible is that to happen? Eric Green : Yes, that's still pending, but we're having these discussions with the customers. And it does require us to prepare in advance in the event that these transitions do occur. As you rightly said, if it remains within the vial configuration, we're very well positioned in that to be able to support the growth of NovaPure and FluroTec, if it transfers into a prefilled string around our plunger solutions. That's where we're also investing to make sure that we are ahead of the curve. So it is - it's ongoing discussions, Juan, and that will be yet to be determined at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Larry Solow : Congrats on a very great quarter actually. Just a couple of questions. Can you just help us sort of parse out on the gross margin, really impressive on the Proprietary side, close to 50%. As you mentioned, I think drilled 350 basis point improvement year-over-year totally. But if we just look sequentially, I'm just trying to sort of bridge the - you did 46% in Q1, and I think that had like a $12 million benefit from some canceled orders. So just sequentially, if we adjust for that, your gross margin was up like 500 bps on a little bit - just on Proprietary side. And I know sales were a little bit higher. COVID sales - related sales were a little bit higher, but I think my math is right. And is there anything sort of unusual in there that drove that 500 basis point sequential increase? Eric Green : It's not that it's unusual. What we're seeing is with product mix, we're seeing a strong pickup in gross margin. So it's just obviously the profile of the products that are being sold around FluroTec and NovaPure. And what we're also seeing is improved levels of productivity in our plants. And as you can tell that last year, we started to move to a 24/7 mode of operation within certain of our plants to increase production. And we have been able to generate a lot of efficiencies and increased levels of productivity as we went through the early part of the year, particularly into Q2 as we got more streamlined in some of the products that we were producing to support COVID. So it was really working on a couple of different elements. So it's not just one driver, it's a number of - it's the mix plus the increased levels of productivity. Larry Solow : Right. And I fully gather. Unusual, I meant maybe there was some like one - little one-time item, something that helped a little bit. Like last quarter, you had that $12 million supply grade credit. But it sounds like, no, right? It sounds like this is maybe not fully sustainable, but there's nothing really irregular. It's a lot of just the drivers of your growth for the last several years, right? Eric Green : Well, once you start running, those larger levels of volume through as well, you're going to get efficiencies. And that's what we did see in Q2. And there was a small little increased levels of production towards the back end of Q2 as we were preparing for Q3 because we do have a level of seasonality in our business. And when we get into Q3, we have planned shutdowns and scheduled maintenance that needs to take place, and particularly, in our European plants. So we wanted to get a little bit ahead of that. So we did build up a small amount of inventory, but nothing overly material. And so as we move into Q3, people have to take that into account when you're looking at the margin for the next quarter that we do have that level of seasonality. Didn't really appear as much last year, but in previous years, we do see a little bit of drop there. But again, it's planned. Larry Solow : Right. Okay. And not to split hairs, but a little bit of a - and this is - basically really gets lost in the shuffle, but on the contract manufacturing side, a little bit of a step back in margin, anything there unusual? I think we had thought that was going to sort of go the other way. Eric Green : Yes. And we have seen it improve as we've gone through 2021, but there were some one-time benefits that we did pick up in Q2 2020, much of it around engineering revenues that we were able to recognize last year. And I think at that time, we called it out as well. So that's the only kind of anomaly there. Larry Solow : Okay. How about on the CapEx outlook, it sounds like you certainly continue to pull things forward, which I think is a high-class problem and going to spend about - it sounds like close to $250 million this year. As we look out over the next couple of years, and I'm sure you still have further expansion opportunities and plans. Do you expect the CapEx, the absolute dollar number to sort of continue to grow? Or since you've pulled forward some, do you think this could sort of level off at least? Eric Green : As a percentage of revenues, I would expect to see it level off and come back to close to that 6% to 7% of revenues. It may not be next year, but I think after that, we'll start to see us normalize. Larry Solow : Okay. Just last question on the Daikyo. Obviously, you guys made a strategic investment - increased your investment a couple of years ago, and that certainly seems like the timing has turned out really well. And I think you put up like a $9 million number this quarter, and obviously, that reflects the strength of Daikyo's business as well. I know this number is a little bit volatile from quarter-to-quarter, but is that - I think run rate year-to-date were over $20 million. Any color on that or on the outlook there? Eric Green : Yes. That's - that number just isn't Daikyo there, but there's another element, too. But they did have a very strong performance in Q2. I think in the first quarter, we were probably $5 million or $6 million on income from affiliates. And I would expect it over time to come down to that level. I don't think it's going to run at what we experienced in Q2, I think it will step back a little bit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Good morning. Maybe first, just a follow-up on something you alluded to, Eric, on Juan's last question. If we do go to smaller dose formats, I think the product you're manufacturing is a bit smaller. Is there any downtime associated with switching over to a smaller format? Or is this something that's a pretty seamless process that it sounds like you're already preparing for? Eric Green : Yes, it's a seamless process. We're just - obviously, we had to change some of the manufacturing equipment, the molds and so forth, but the process and facilities and our team members that are involved making these products are all consistent. So it's a pretty quick transition. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for that, Eric. And then just on high-value products. Obviously, a lot of mix shift towards those with the COVID-related work. But I guess if we look at that portfolio ex-COVID, are you seeing high-value product mix ex-COVID? It sounds like there's a lot of reasons you're excited about what's going on in biologics, but just curious on that. Eric Green : Yes. You got my excitement, Jacob. Absolutely. So if you think about our - you go back to that confirmed order book that's one indicator for us is the mix of incremental within that portfolio is evenly distributed. When you think about between COVID new drug launches that I kind of mentioned that we're continuing to have a very high participation rate of new approvals and then the growth of the core business. And we even cut it a little bit further, over half or majority, call it, over half of it is in the biologics space. And the portfolio itself is all towards the high end of HVP. So you can see the momentum that is gaining. And when you think about the capital investments we're making because of the biologics growth and some of the small molecule new entrants, these tranches that we spoke of a reference, it is really - it is all around HVP when you think about FluroTec, NovaPure in existing facilities. So it's very high growth, I guess, in the HVP, and we expect that to continue on. I just want to preference the number of units that we are producing in HVP still is, let's call it, below 25% of our Proprietary portfolio. So we have a long runway ahead of us to continue this momentum with our HVP portfolio. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger : Eric, you said you've got a great order book and it's getting longer. Do you have a decent picture yet about whether COVID-related work will be larger for you or smaller in '23 compared to '22? Eric Green : That's a little bit too far out. We have good conversations that are ongoing. And as you know, investments we need to make are six to 12, maybe sometimes 18 months, in advance. So we do have some visibility, but it's too premature to mention that as we speak. John Kreger : Okay. Sounds good. And then a non-COVID demand question for you. Have you been able to satisfy all that demand at this point? Or have you had to defer any of those orders as you prioritize work relating to the pandemic? Eric Green : Yes. We're meeting our customers' demands so that we may have to work with a few customers here and there to make sure that we're scheduling their orders based on the commitments, but we're meeting all our customer commitments as we speak, and we will continue to do so. One of the release files that we've been able to observe in the last several - couple of quarters is the installed validated capacity that is going online. So if you think about some of the constraints that we may have had historically around HVP, those are being relieved as we speak. So - but the bottom line is that we are meeting our customer commitments. John Kreger : Sounds good. And then one last one. Could you give us an update on Crystal Zenith. I think last quarter, you talked about some new commercial lines coming online in Arizona. Just give us a sense of where that stands now? And what are the type of products that are driving demand for that newer category? Eric Green : Yes. Really, it's all around the biologics space. So it's around the prefilled strange. We had - as you mentioned, we had a line that went on that's up and running this quarter. It's a CZ, one - it's insert needle, prefilled syringe line. We have another line that is starting installation later this year with the focus having delivered before the end of the year. So it's a significant step-up for us around the CZ portfolio, particularly on prefilled syringes. In addition to that, we are working with our partner Daikyo as they are continuously expanding their capacity capabilities around CZ out of Japan to support with other configurations like Luer Lock such as vials configurations. So I'm pleased with the progress we're making, but there's more to come. Operator : Your next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Dave Windley : A very nice quarter and thanks for the updates and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start around productivity. You touched on this a time or two, Eric. The - and it seemed intuitive to me and you confirm that as your volumes in some of these higher - call it, higher tier, high-value products have gotten to some level of critical mass that you would get some scale on that. I guess I'm wondering if you'd be willing to put, say, some rough percentage numbers on - like have margins on a like-for-like basis improved by a material amount. Would you be willing to put numbers on that? Eric Green : Well, let me qualify and then I'll look to Bernard to quantify that. But you're - Dave, you're right. What's happening is that we're getting meaningful volumes over the last few quarters on the higher end of the HVP. And there's a - it's been driven by the biologics and a few small molecules. So it is a lot easier for our plants to run longer lot units in our facilities, and we're seeing that translate into better margins with those parts of the portfolio. And that - we believe that will continue because we're leveraging existing footprint. We are installing additional capacity, that's correct, but the payback is much shorter and all this is translating in better outcomes of NovaPure and also parts of FluroTec. So I don't know, Bernard, if you want to add any comments to that. Bernard Birkett : Yes. I would say, it's still - the vast majority of the margin expansion that we're seeing is coming from mix, but it is being supported by improvements in productivity and efficiencies. Now we did see a big spike in Q2, a big lift there. But as I said, when we move into Q3 because there are fewer production days, that's - the level of absorption in Q3 will be a little bit less. So I don't believe you're going to see as much margin expansion in Q3, and we typically see the most margin expansion in Q2 as we're running higher levels and the quarter is actually longer for us, but it's still primarily driven by mix. And I would probably think 10%, 20% of the benefit is probably coming from efficiencies of productivity. Dave Windley : Helpful. And specifically on that, beyond the crush of the pandemic, would you expect to continue to run plants three shifts a day, seven days a week into the foreseeable future? Or is that a treadmill that's kind of running unsustainably fast? Bernard Birkett : Well, based on the current demand we have outside of COVID, which is higher than our typical run rates, we are going to need to continue to run our plants accordingly so we can level load them. So I would say, in many cases, we will be continuing to run the 24/7. And the demand of new molecules are being approved and also our current base business would expect that. We think about the growth of our business today, yes, COVID has been a major impact to that, but the core is still growing around the double-digit range. So it's a very strong, robust foundation that we're working off of. Dave Windley : And the CapEx that you've mentioned and you've talked about within existing plants, and you - I think you named a few relative to projects that are either in flight or already completed. Is - Waterford when the company built it was highlighted for its kind of flexibility and modularity. Is that a target of a lot of this expansion? Or is it not exclusively water - is it more balanced across the world than that? Bernard Birkett : It's balanced across the world, but I would tell you that Waterford - if you visited Waterford two years ago, you would not recognize it. It has significantly increased throughput. Additional capital has been put into Waterford. We increased the number of team members in that site significantly. So yes, these investments we're making because we really create this network around HVP in multiple sites. So we are not dependent on a site, but we've raised the volume level quite significant in Waterford. And we intend to continue to do so because it's been designed exactly what you've articulated. It's a modular approach, we can keep on adding to it, the infrastructure and continue to put more volume through that. But I want to be clear, though, we still have that capability in Kinston. We're expanding Singapore. We have additional capabilities in other locations like Kovin and Eschweiler. So it's not just one site of investment, it's multiple sites, but heavily weighted towards Waterford. Dave Windley : Got it. Okay. Bernard Birkett : We visited Waterford a couple of weeks ago, and it was my first time there in about two years, and the level of activity in that plants compared to where it was two years ago, it's just transformational as to what's happening there and how we've been able to leverage that. And that's really helped us in our response to COVID and also the core growth, but it's - it does kind of highlight to us that we have to have some of this infrastructure in place before we actually believe we need it. So - but I think, as you said that it is on a modular basis, it allows us to expand much faster in the future than we would have done in the past. And I think, as Eric said, that's the same for Kinston and Singapore sites as well. Dave Windley : Last one for me. Hoping to draw out a specific number again. Last couple of quarters on your high-value products, you've used the phrase or the terminology over 70%. And I'm wondering, does that mean 70.5% over or 75% over or 80% over? Like it seems like the growth is so strong that it could be moving percentage points above 70%. I just wanted to get a more specific number if you'll give it. Thanks. Bernard Birkett : No, I won't give it. Yes. I think it gives enough color and also the trend is the important thing there as we can see significant improvement in that number quarter-over-quarter. And it is forecast to continue to improve based on the demand that we're seeing, particularly around the biologics segment. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Erica, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. An online archive of the broadcast will be available on our website at westpharma.com in the Investors section. Additionally, you may access a replay through Thursday, August 5, by using the dial-in numbers and the conference ID provided by the - at the end of today's earnings release. That concludes the call for today. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to West\u2019s CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning everyone. And thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5. Our team delivered an incredibly strong third quarter. Our proven market led strategy delivered double-digit growth across all three market units and geographies and excluding positive impact from sales related to the pandemic. We delivered double-digit growth in our base business. With continued strong adoption of our high value products, coupled with solid execution and leveraging our global operating model. It has led to robust margin expansion and EPS growth for the quarter. Our Q3 performance was made possible by the commitment of the West team members across the globe. We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients. I\u2019m very proud and humbled of how we live our purpose by producing billions of components and devices each quarter. And we do so with the knowledge that each and every component we make is impacting patient\u2019s life. We continue to fulfill our purpose by earning our customers\u2019 trust by leading with quality, service and science. Looking ahead, we are well positioned with the right growth strategy. Our committed order book remains robust. We continue to capture the benefits of the globalization of our operating network and continued capital investments to support the increasing demand driven by the pandemic and attractive end markets. With this substantial momentum, we are raising our sales and EPS guidance for the full year 2021. And for the 29th consecutive year, we are increasing the company\u2019s dividend. Bernard will go into greater detail shortly. Turning to Slide 6. Our key drivers of growth in Q3 are being fueled by COVID-19 customers that are using our stoppers and seals, including the highest level of NovaPure and FluroTec. Biologic customers that are shifting preference from FluroTec to our premium platform, NovaPure to achieve the highest quality and tightest specifications for their newly approved biologic drugs and pharma and generic customers that are increasing orders as their demand grows for non-COVID-19 vaccines and injectable drugs. Shifting to our device portfolio and our longstanding partnership with Daikyo Seiko. We continue to see adoption and uptick of customer interest for new pipeline drugs with Crystal Zenith syringes, cartridges, and vials. To meet this demand and stay ahead of the current growth trends for future approvals, we have continued to add manufacturing capacity for CZ. Our teams have successfully validated additional lines for insert needles, syringes, and will begin producing commercial product by the end of the year. All these products, as well as other HVP components are contributing to our growing book of committed orders, which position us well for the remainder of the year and into 2022 and beyond. Moving to Slide 7. To-date, we have been leveraging our global infrastructure and tapping it into the agility of our own team to meet the increased customer orders. As we highlighted in Q2, several phases of investment are proceeding, and now being realized. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have expanded capacity at 13 existing sites with 30 major facility modifications dedicated over 300 million of capital and added over 400 incremental pieces of equipment. All while keeping pace with a growing base demand and moving our operations to 24/7. As our book of committed orders continues to surge, we will continue to make further strategic investments to meet demand. Today, we\u2019re announcing a fourth phase of capacity expansion that will commence in 2022. This will primarily focus on expanding NovaPure production at our HVP sites in the United States and Europe. Shifting to the rapidly changing environment and the impact of COVID-19 on the global supply chain, no industry has been immune to this impact. We\u2019re working with our partners to help overcome challenges that span from transportation and logistics, to raw materials and securing labor, all leading to cost inflation and delays. We are successfully navigating this environment. Thanks to Part 2, our unsurpassed manufacturing footprint that will continue to serve our business well, as we operate through these unprecedented times. Turning the Slide 8, I\u2019m proud of this significant progress we have made on our ESG priorities. These have been an integral part of our one West culture and our commitment to all our stakeholders and the communities where we work and live. Over the past six years, we continue to raise the bar in all aspects of our ESG initiatives, and we remain on track to publish by year-end a supplement to our 2020 corporate responsibility report incorporating the SASB and TFCD ESG standards. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on the financial performance. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let\u2019s review the numbers in more detail. We\u2019ll first look at Q3 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance in our biologics, generics and pharma market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter, as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance. First up Q3, our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slide 17 to 21. We recorded net sales of $706.5 million representing organic sales growth of 27.9%. COVID related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $115 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. Looking at Slide 10. Proprietary products sales grew organically by 35.7% in the quarter. High value products, which made up approximately 73%, our proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all of our market units in Q3. Looking at the performance of the market units. The biologics market unit delivered strong double digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high value product offering. The generics market units also experienced double digit growth led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. Our pharma market units also saw a strong double digit growth with sales led by high value products, including Westar, FluroTec NovaPure components. And contract manufacturing had low single digit organic sales growth for the third quarter led once again, by sales of healthcare related medical devices. We continued to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $288.2 million in gross profit, $93.6 million or 48.1% above Q3 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 40.8% was a 530 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $182.8 million recorded this quarter compared to $103.9 million in the same period last year or a 75.9% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin 25.9% was a 690 basis point increase on the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 79% for Q3, excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.11 in Q3, EPS grew by approximately 72%. Let\u2019s review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $142.9 million or 26.1 percentage points of growth, including approximately $83 million of incremental volume driven by COVID-19 related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $10.1 million or 1.8 percentage points of growth. Looking at margin performance. Slide 19 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 40.8% for Q3 2021, up 35.5% in Q3 2020. Proprietary products third quarter gross profit margin of 46.3% was 550 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2020. The key drivers for continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were favorable mix of product sold driven by growth in high value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation. Contract manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 16.1% was 180 basis points below the margin achieved in the quarter of 2020. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to mix of product sold as well as timing of the pass through of raw material price increases to customers. Now let\u2019s look of our balance sheet takeaway and review how we\u2019ve done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash was $423.2 million for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $99.4 million compared to the same period last year, a 0.7% increase. Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by a working capital increase as well as timing of tax payments. Our third quarter 2021 year-to-date capital spending was $176.9 million, $62 \u2013 $60.2 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1 billion at September 30, 202, increased by $169.4 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales. Our cash balance at September 30 of $688 million with $72.5 million higher than our December 2020 balance. The increase in cash is primarily due to our strong operating results in the period offset by our share repurchase program and higher CapEx. Turning to guidance. Slide 14 provides a high level summary. Full year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.8 billion and $2.81 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $2.76 billion to $2.785 billion. This guidance includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $450 million. There is an estimated benefit of $55 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $80 million. This $25 million reduction in FX tailwind has been absorbed into our guidance. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 28% compared to a prior range of 24% to 25%. We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $8.40 to $8.50 compared to a prior range of $8.05 to $8.20. This revised guidance includes $0.35 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation from the first nine months of 2021. Also our CapEx guidance remains at $260 million to $275 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as we review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.19 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $0.27. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. To summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top line growth and proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 15, the excellent financial performance reported today continues to reaffirm that our strategy is working. Our market led approach is delivering unique value to our customers. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering product in this complex environment with a focus on service and quality. And we\u2019re continuing to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. Most importantly, we have an incredible team working to make this all happen. We are proud to serve as a valuable trusted partner for customers to support patient health and look forward to continue to play a critical role in delivering healthcare well into the future. Amanda, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Thank you very much. Congratulations on another good quarter. And sounds like the outlook Eric, continues to improve. Maybe you can just discuss a little bit on the additional capacity expansions today that you announced. On NovaPure is that \u2013 it sounds like just another acceleration from planned capacity expansion that was probably a couple years \u2013 originally going to be a couple years out. So maybe is this NovaPure your expansion driven more on the base business, on the vaccine side? Is that more of a mix? Maybe you can give us a little color on that. Eric Green : Larry thanks for the question and good morning. No, you\u2019re absolutely correct. So what we\u2019re seeing with the additional capital expansion is it was planned for further years out, brought it forward. This is more of a demand of both areas of biologics, new drug molecules being launched. And around the NovaPure, particularly around the plungers and also the life cycle management of COVID vaccines, as you think about various configurations, whether it\u2019s in a vial configuration or a prefilled syringe. So it is a mix effect. And we brought it forward based on our discussions with customers and commitments that obviously we are making for them, but also what they\u2019re making towards us. Larry Solow : And in terms of the life cycle management on the COVID vaccines, do you see this proliferating more into \u2013 as it goes more into doctor\u2019s offices and maybe less on the mass vaccine basis, whereas the community centers and whatnot. I would imagine that benefit to you. Do you have any visibility on that that you can share with us in terms of dosing, switching maybe from five, 10 per vial to down to single doses? Eric Green : Well, Larry those conversations are ongoing right now. When we look at the current mix that we have for our customers, it\u2019s still mostly in regards to the COVID vaccines, it\u2019s still mostly within vials and multiple doses per vials. But we continue to prepare ourselves as things do change over time. But the near-term, near-future we\u2019re really focused on meeting the current configuration. Think about our capital expansions, they\u2019re taking typically between one \u2013 let\u2019s call it 12 to 18 months to get in validated and start scaling up production. So that\u2019s the type of timeline we\u2019re looking at far as preparing ourselves for any additional demand and other configurations. Larry Solow : Got you. And then just last a quick one. I saw you guys have release on this and this might just be a small little additional service offer. You guys on this DeltaCube modeling platform that you put out, I think that was presented at industry meeting a couple weeks ago. Is there any color on that this sort of online I guess, it helps customers design their packaging needs and whatnot. Any color on that. Eric Green : Yes. Larry, one of the drivers, if you think about our pillars of strategy under execute, one of the key drivers of being market led is digitization, obviously internally, but externally for our customers and also digitization of product, now same focus on customers. What we \u2013 we have a wealth of data and science information that we\u2019ve developed in our laboratories and work with the customers over the years. And what we\u2019ve been able to do is use together our digital capabilities that we\u2019ve been building over the last couple years with a predictive modeling capability, which is a more data driven offering. So as you can imagine, a customer trying to identify with their complex molecule that they\u2019re looking at developing and obviously ultimately, commercializing. What is the ideal packaging configuration? And so that is where we are bringing that data to the forefront leading with science, being that scientific destination choice for our customers and providing that those insights. So more to come. We\u2019re excited that we launched this. But for me personally, it\u2019s a great example of our leadership position in leading with science for our customers. Larry Solow : Absolutely. I look forward to learn more about that. Okay, great. Thanks, Eric. I appreciate the thoughts. Eric Green : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. Your line is now open. John Kreger : A question about COVID visibility. Based upon your discussions with clients and your order book, when would you expect your COVID volumes to start to tail off? Eric Green : Well, right now, the way we see our confirmed order book on a complete \u2013 if you look at it as a complete order book \u2013 committed book, you\u2019ll find that the \u2013 we\u2019ll see that the COVID piece continues to increase. It\u2019s not the majority of it, but it is continuously increased. And so we have good visibility going into 2022. John a lot of the invest that we\u2019ve made committed to last year and the one that we just spoke of today a good portion of that is related to COVID vaccines to support not just the demands in the more mature markets, but basically on a global basis. So I won\u2019t give a number out on the COVID piece, but it\u2019s still very robust for us. John Kreger : Okay. Thanks. So the COVID 2022 outlook would appear to be up from 2021. Eric Green : Well, there\u2019s a lot of factors, John in that, but right now, the way we\u2019re discussing it with customers expanding capacity and building the capabilities in our plants, we anticipate similar, if not a little more stronger demand in 2022. John Kreger : Sounds good. Bernard Birkett : We\u2019re also seeing, it\u2019s not just the COVID demand that the CapEx expansions are for it. It\u2019s for our core business demand. And as Eric alluded to earlier, like we are seeing strong growth in those areas as well. So the CapEx is not just reliant on COVID, it\u2019s there to support our business over the short and medium and long-term. So we have enough capacity over time to or enough demand to fill that capacity when it starts to come online. John Kreger : That\u2019s good. Thanks, Bernard. Actually a follow-up question for you on margins. Given the surge that you guys have seen over the last year, what is your comfort level that they can be sustained as you think about longer term planning? Or should we think about those margins to kind of come back to the older trend line once COVID volumes start to normalize? Bernard Birkett : I wouldn\u2019t see the margins coming back to where they were. I think the gains that we have gained over the last 12 to 24 months, our plan is to hold onto those and actually expand margins further as we move out over the next number of years. And you can see it in the dynamic of our business and where the growth is actually coming from. So it\u2019s \u2013 a lot of it is placed within the biologic market unit, and that is driving a lot of the growth on revenue, but plus on margins. And again, it\u2019s not specifically reliant on COVID it\u2019s within our core business. And what we\u2019re actually seeing and you can see on some of the callouts, the growth that we\u2019re seeing around generics and pharma, we are seeing the high value products, getting traction in those areas also. So coupled with the efficiencies that we\u2019re forecasting to come from operations, we believe that we will continue to expand margins. Will it be at the same pace as what we\u2019re experiencing here in 2021? That\u2019s something that we will give further information on when we guide here in the first part of 2022. John Kreger : All right. Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik DeBruin : Hey, good morning. Eric Green : Good morning, Derik. Derik DeBruin : Hi. So a couple question. I think first one, can you talk a little about the contract manufacturing segment a little bit lower than what we had forecast and also comps start getting easier next quarter. So should we start to think about starting next quarter, your back at sort of that high single digit, low double digit growth rates that your long-term guide implies? Bernard Birkett : Yes. If you\u2019re talking about getting to the end of 2021, I wouldn\u2019t see. Derik DeBruin : Yes. Yes, yes. Bernard Birkett : I wouldn\u2019t see acceleration in the growth rates in that timeframe. My expectation is it\u2019ll be pretty similar to what we saw here in Q3. And we had been signaling that, talking about that for a long time, that the growth in contract manufacturing would modify for a period of time. And then as we move into 2022 and 2023, we would expect to see that growth to begin to accelerate again, but more in line with kind of mid single digit growth rates, rather than like double digit growth rates that we had experienced in 2017 and 2018. And so we\u2019ve looked at the mix of our business and looked at where we should be deploying our capital to make sure that we are getting growth rates, but also that it\u2019s on our proprietary side. We\u2019re still very, very focused on contract, but I wouldn\u2019t see it growing at double digits. Derik DeBruin : Great. That\u2019s really helpful color. And can we talk a little bit about how you sort of thinking about CapEx over the next 2022, 2023 time period? I mean, since you\u2019re pointing some things forward, should we expect similar levels next year? So that\u2019s one. And then I guess, what\u2019s the revenue potential for the additional capacity expansions that you\u2019ve got ongoing overall? Bernard Birkett : So as Eric said, we\u2019re seeing very, very strong demand both within our core business and responding to COVID. So, our CapEx stepped up in 2020 and here again in 2021, and we\u2019re not going to guide to a number for 2022, but it will be a little bit higher than what we would\u2019ve normally guided at least on that 6% to 7%. And that\u2019s the \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing is, and if you look at it over the last probably, 12 to 18 months, we\u2019re stepping up capital on an incremental basis. So understanding that the demand is there so that we can feed into it pretty quickly. So all of the capital expansions are tied into demands that we can see coming from customers over the 2022, 2023 time horizon. Derik DeBruin : Great. And can you talk a little bit more about being able to pass on for pricing raw materials? Just we\u2019re getting a lot of questions from clients on those topics across the board, but we\u2019d love to hear you sort of elaborate more on the supply chain and pricing dynamics? Eric Green : Yes, so we\u2019ve been passing on cost increases to customers again throughout 2020 and 2021, particularly on phrase, as freight charges and logistical charges increased, we were able to pass those on to many of our customers on components, specific components where we have seen price increases, both within contract manufacturing and in our proprietary business, we have been passing those on to our customers. And obviously, keeping them in the loop as to what\u2019s happening, but what are driving these price increases that we\u2019re passing on. And also as we look out into 2022, we have various mechanisms in place to enable us to pass on many of these increases and it depends on what the relationship with the customer, whether it\u2019s contracted business or not, but in the various sectors, we have various tools that we employ. So we\u2019re able to \u2013 we don\u2019t have to absorb the majority of those inflationary costs. And then also we\u2019re working on the other side to make sure that we\u2019re getting leaner and more efficient and to make sure that we can deal with those from that angle as well. So there\u2019s a multifaceted approach. Derik DeBruin : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul Knight : When you look and when you plan this CapEx and look at future demand, is it emanating from fill and finish customers, or is it emanating from the therapeutic programs that are in like stability trials? How do you pinpoint what this demand may look like in even 2023 and outer? Eric Green : Yes, Paul, the driver of the demand expansion or the demand increase that we\u2019re seeing in requiring capacity expansion is really driven by the therapeutic companies directly with the drug customers, not the fill and finish. So as you know, it\u2019s a whole ecosystem and we know where we play, but our interactions are directly with the drug customers. What\u2019s also exciting is to see is that it\u2019s not just concentrated one area, i.e. biologics. It\u2019s also, we\u2019re starting to see pick up in small molecules also which is good for our long-term franchise, but yes, absolutely the drug customers. Paul Knight : And then as you look at your capacity expansion, are you having to \u2013 is it 12 to 18 months with customer validation? And are you running into challenges that I\u2019m guessing some of these are even Greenfield sites, so will you have to stretch out that, what is the duration of a build to actual produce revenue timeline? Eric Green : Yes, Paul, what\u2019s fascinating about \u2013 what\u2019s actually quite exciting is that a few years ago we made the strategic decision to start creating centers of excellence and started to consolidate our manufacturing into particular sites throughout the world and became more effective through in systems, working with our customers, through our quality systems, also in processes to create more of an operating network. So the short answer to your questions, this is not greenfield. A lot of the investments we\u2019re making right now are physical equipment, process expansions, maybe moving some modular approach in some sites. You\u2019ve been to Waterford, we\u2019ll be looking at maybe expanding that site with another modular addition on the side, but it is leveraging existing facilities. When you add it all up, it really comes down to how fast we can have the equipment manufactured, delivered, installed, and gone through validation since a lot of the equipment is replicating what\u2019s in place already. The validation process with customers is very short, so we could have some expansion proved up and running less than just in a couple quarters. Some other expansions might take four or five quarters to get up and running. Bernard Birkett : Yes, Paul, as soon as the equipment hits the production floor and is validated, it\u2019s operational. So we have demand to feed into its straight away so that the payback on the capital is pretty quick for us at this point. And again, that\u2019s why we were doing this phased approach so we can manage it appropriately. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you. Eric Green : Thanks, Paul. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dave Windley : Great, I wanted to ask a few, first one is whether or not your views on your COVID revenue for the full year change with the results that you posted in third quarter. Is it still $430 million? Eric Green : $450 million. Dave Windley : $450 million okay. Eric Green : We called out. Dave Windley : Okay. Sorry. I missed that. On innovation Eric, the CZ was a topic of a conversation really dating back to before your tenure got quiet for a while and I hear you calling it out. Again, I guess, I\u2019m interested in, maybe some color around the drivers of that. Did the company \u2013 has the company kind of enhanced the material or work through some developmental bottlenecks with clients that\u2019s allowed that to kind of break free on a renewed basis? Eric Green : Yes, Dave, if you think about the device portfolio, let\u2019s just call it roughly 5% of West on the proprietary side. So 5% of the business, CZ is the largest portion of that. And what we\u2019re seeing is the reality is we\u2019re continuously optimizing the product and coming out with new line extensions, however it\u2019s taken while to see the market and gain confidence and traction, but once it starts becoming quite common use for the high end biologics, we\u2019re seeing that acceleration. So in particular with the insert needle syringes that we have been producing in Arizona, we\u2019re actually at the stage of doubling capacity by the end of this year. And that\u2019s what was referenced. So when you think about the growth, which is above the company average, significantly above the company average, we do see through the number of approvals of drugs in the market. Plus what\u2019s in the pipeline that\u2019s being reviewed as we speak that this is an exciting area, but it has taken time. You\u2019re right. Dave, it\u2019s been \u2013 this has been discussed for a number of years, but now it\u2019s becoming more noticeable in our growth numbers, particularly around devices. Dave Windley : And then sticking with innovation, in previous commentary, you\u2019ve talked about, hey, NovaPure is not the end of the road. We\u2019re not done with NovaPure. We want to continue to innovate, any comments on that front is NovaPure Prime in the offing at any time in the near future? Eric Green : Well, I don\u2019t know if I can use that now, because I\u2019ll have to notate you. I will say stay tuned, I got to be careful in that category, but I will tell you that what\u2019s really exciting is that the teams that we\u2019ve put together, particularly with the market led approach, we\u2019re getting better insights on where we are headed on what products are being pulled by our customers and what problems we\u2019re trying to solve. I know earlier, we just briefly mentioned a new digital tool and that actually was DeltaCube that was actually derived from conversations with our customers. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could do this? So stay tuned on that question. We are constantly developing and but be assured though there will be products that are being pulled by our customers today. Dave Windley : Got it. Last question for me is around capital deployment. You\u2019ve talked at times about being interested in acquisitions. I can imagine that maybe finding what you wanted at attractive prices might be a little hard in this market. Raise the dividend, but not by much. Is there any appetite given of growing cash on the balance sheet to say, make the dividend more substantial or are you holding it back for acquisitions? What\u2019s your thought around cash? Eric Green : Well, I would say the first priority, Dave, and particularly in the environment that we\u2019re in today is to continue to feel the very robust organic growth that we have in our hands and that we\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s a great problem to solve, right. And so we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our own infrastructure. What I\u2019m excited about is that it\u2019s a really short payback and it\u2019s expanding current portfolio. We do think there\u2019s opportunities on the M&A front and we\u2019re continuously building that capability out here. But our primary focus I\u2019ll tell you is laser focus on execution. But we\u2019re opening up our discussions broader than that today. Dave Windley : Thank you. Eric Green : Thanks Dave. Operator : I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Amanda. And thank you for joining us on today\u2019s conference call.

We are excited to discuss our 2021 results and outlook for 2022. We will start on slide 5. West delivered a remarkable year of success. As I reflect on the year three things stand out to me. First, our purpose. We serve to improve patient lives and we understand the criticality of our role in the containment and delivery of life saving and life changing medicines including the battle against COVID-19. Our team members have rallied together with great sense, strength and resolve to meet the accelerated customer demand. I want to acknowledge this incredible efforts and say thank you. Second, our proven market lead strategy, we have continued to meet shifting market and customer needs with unique value propositions across our business segments. This is evident in the continued strength of our financial performance in 2021. Lastly, trust. Customers trust West. As a global leader customers come to us knowing that we will deliver superior value through our high quality products and solutions. And we remain focused on delivering value to all our stakeholders on a sustainable basis and doing our part to support the healthcare industry. As highlighted on slide 6, 2021 was an exceptional year of sales and margin expansion driven by strong demand in our base business and accelerated demand for components associated with COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. We ended the year with 28% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and adjusted for COVID related sales our based business grew by mid teens organically. Our proprietary product segment led the way with 37% organic sales growth. And all of this was fueled by high value products, resulting in impressive growth and operating margin expansion for the quarter. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned with the right growth strategy around execute, innovate and grow. Our committed order book is at an all time high. We continue to realize the benefits of the globalization of our operating model and continue capital investments to support the increase in demand driven by the attractive end markets. Turning to slide 7. In addition to our financial momentum, West had several other notable accomplishments in 2021. We shipped over 45 billion components touching billions of patient lives. This was done with the continued safety of our team members as top priority and the importance of ensuring the continuity of supply for our customers. As scientific and technical leaders in the industry, we continue to broaden insights with our expertise through West knowledge center, webinars, published articles and technical presentations. We launched five product extensions that continue to bring additional value to our customers, and we donated over $2.5 million. But more importantly, over 3600 volunteer hours were donated by team members to help our local communities with the greatest needs. As we move to slide 8, we strive to be stewards of a sustainable future by factoring environmental considerations into every aspect of our business. In 2021, we expanded our ESG transparency reporting by aligning with a task force for climate related financial disclosure recommendations. This includes reducing energy dependencies, and lessening the emission production through renewable and greener energy, developing more carbon-friendly products, and actively engaging with stakeholders to seek out opportunities to have an impact on climate. Aligned with our focus to improving patient lives across the globe through our products, we remain strongly committed to creating a healthier environment with efforts that will have a positive impact on our communities, and future generations. Turning to slide 9, and the recent announcement of our collaboration with Corning. As you look across biotech and pharma companies, drug pipelines, there is a growing need to provide system solutions to support increasingly more sensitive and complex molecules. And with that comes a changing and increasing regulatory environment that are setting a high bar requirements for performance data on combination products at the system level. These regulatory changes are driving drug manufacturers to look to West to reduce risk by specifically specifying a system of packaging rather than individual components. We\u2019re excited to have Corning as a key collaborator as we expand our HVP value proposition to lead the industry from components to a truly integrated system that couples Elastomer and glass. In response to our customers this exclusive supply and technology agreement with Corning includes significant investment in R&D and capital for installed manufacturing capacity to expand Corning\u2019s valor glass technology. By combining West industry leading NovaPure components with Daikyo FluroTec coating technology and coordinates, Corning\u2019s valor, glass and velocity vials, the collaboration will enable new advanced pharmaceutical packaging solutions. We believe that an integrated system of elastomeric glass under a single drug master file is the next level of high value products. Our initial focus is addressing the need for complete system offering and in time, we will offer a broad range of systems from vials to prefilled syringes to cartridges. As we enter in 2022, we are building on the positive momentum we generate in 2021. We are introducing full year 2022 financial guidance that assumes approximately 10% organic sales led by strong HVP sales, and another strong year of both gross and operating profit margin expansion well in excess of 100 basis points. This guidance includes a substantial acceleration in our R&D efforts as we enter this new era of integrated systems. And with a robust book of committed orders, we see momentum in 2022 and continuing into 2023. As such, we expect to add more capital expansion plans for additional HVP capacity to stay ahead of our customers demand. We expect these projects to be completed throughout the year and ready for 2023 production. Before I turn the call over to Bernard to review our financial results in detail, I want to revisit our long term financial construct. For the past few years we have set our long term financial construct as any organic sales growth of 6% to 8% led by HVP sales and annual operating profit margin expansion of 100 basis points per year. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve had an annual organic sales CAGR of 13% and annual operating profit margin expansion of 240 basis points per year. Five years ago, biologics was our smallest market unit. Today biologics is our largest market with customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma coming to West and our partner Daikyo which is reinforced by our strong participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and also in Europe. As we look to the future, we see continued demand growth for HVP products. As we launch a new level HVP\u2019s integrated systems we\u2019re updating our long term construct two annual sales growth of 7% to 9% and we continue to expect to span operating margins by 100 basis points per year over the next few years. Now I will turn it over to our CFO Bernard Birkett who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let\u2019s review the numbers in more detail. We\u2019ll first look at Q4, 2021 revenues and profits, where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in each of our proprietary market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw on the quarter, as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will review our 2022 guidance. First up Q4, our financial results are summarized on slide 10 and the reconciliation of non-US GAAP measures are described in slides 19 to 22. We recorded net sales of $730.8 million in the quarter, representing organic sales growth 28.3%. COVID related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $124 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID 19 patients offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. Looking at slide 11, proprietary product sales grew organically by 36.8% in the quarter. High value products, which made up approximately 74% of proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all of our market units in Q4. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double digit growth led by Novapure and Westar components. The generics and pharma market units also experienced double digit growth led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. And contract manufacturing organic net sales declined by 2.1% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower sales of healthcare related medical devices. We continue to see improvement in gross profits. We recorded $300.6 million in gross profits, 89.5 million or 42.4% above Q4 of last year, and our gross profit margin of 41.1% with a 470 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profits with $189.2 million recorded this quarter compared to 119.1 million in the same period last year for 58.9% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 25.9% was a 540 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 52% for Q4 excluding stock based compensation tax benefit of $0.6 in Q4. EPS grew by approximately 58%. So let\u2019s review the growth drivers in both revenue and profits. On slide 12, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributions at $153 million or 26.4 percentage points of growth, including approximately $78 million of incremental volume driven by COVID-19 related net demand. Sales price increases contributed 11.3 million or 1.9 percentage points of growth. Looking at margin performance. Slide 13 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 41.1% for Q4, 2021, up from 36.4% in Q4, 2020. Proprietary products fourth quarter gross profit margin 46.3% was 460 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020. The key drivers for the continued improvements in proprietary products gross profit margin were favorable mix of product sold driven by growth in high value products, production efficiencies, sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation. Contract manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.5% was 70 basis points below the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to increased raw material cost and a mix of product sold. Now let\u2019s look at our balance sheet and review how we\u2019ve done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 14, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $584 million for the year, an increase of $111.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 23.6% increase. Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by a working capital increase as well as an increase in tax payments. In 2021, we spent over $253 million on capital expenditures, a 45% increase over 2020. The majority of the incremental CapEx has been leveraged to increase our high value product manufacturing capacity within our existing facilities. We expanded capacity at 13 existing sites, the 13 major facility modifications and over 400 pieces of equipment all while keeping pace with the growing demand. We have continued to increase capacity at our HVP sites in the U.S., Germany, Ireland, and in Singapore and we have been able to leverage our existing asset base to support proprietary products manufacturing. For example, our Williamsport Pennsylvania site formally a contract manufacturing site will be transformed with over half its manufacturing capacity to support proprietary products with elastomer mixing and batch off line. And this leverage is a close proximity to our HVP site at Jersey Shore. As we flex our global infrastructure with the phase capacity expansion, we are well-positioned for the continued growth in 2022. Working capital of approximately $1.1 billion increased a $277.6 million from 2020, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales, higher inventory levels and an increase in our cash position. Our cash balance at December 31, a $762.6 million was $147.1 million higher in our December 2020 balance. The increase in cash is primarily due to our strong operating results in the period offset by our share repurchase program and higher CapEx. Turning to guidance. Slide 15 provides a high level summary. Full-year 2022 net sales guidance will be in a range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $70 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 10%. This comp comprises a mid-teen growth in our proprietary business. The forecast includes mid-teen growth in our base business and mid-teen growth in our net COVID related revenues. For contract manufacturing, we are forecasting low-to-mid single digit negative growth in 2022. We do expect contract manufacturing to return to growth in 2023. We expect our full-year 2022 reports of diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $9.20 to $9.35, also our CapEx guidance is $380 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS had an impact of approximately $0.21 based on current foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock based compensation. To summarize the key takeaways for the fourth quarter, strong topline growth in proprietary. Gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate, and grow. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bern. To summarize, in Slide 16, the excellent financial performance reported today continues to reaffirm that our strategy is working. We have a strong base business proven by our market led approach was delivering unique value to our customers. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing the delivery products in its complex environment with a focus on service and quality. And we\u2019re continuing to accelerate capital spending across our operations to the current and anticipated future growth. We realize that our products are critical for healthcare across the globe which is why we\u2019re so dedicated to support patient health today and well into the future. So Wanda, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik DeBruin : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of points initially. So, can you remind us what the full-year COVID contribution number was for \u201821? And as you still look at the \u201822 guide, and just in general of the business, I mean are you capacity constrained on your non-COVID products. I\u2019ve been paced to be this is a polite way of asking that is as COVID sort of rolls off or you can be able to backfill that with non-COVID business and then reach into the question of what does \u201823 look like? Bernard Birkett : So, good morning, Derik. And on the COVID number is 459 for 2021. And we would expect to see that grow in the mid-teen range and within 2022. And capacity, I\u2019ll hand over to, yes? Eric Green : Yes, thanks Derik. So, on the capacity, you\u2019re right. And when we think about where we\u2019re adding the capacity, it is really around HVP products prior to at NovaPure plungers and stoppers. And if you think about the two areas of high growth that we\u2019re experiencing and we anticipate continued growth around the vaccines, but also in our biologics portfolio which would and is consuming the additional capacity that we\u2019re putting in place as we speak today. So, we have plans that we\u2019ve create investments in 2020 and that has been put in place and being ready for production as we speak. And we have additional capacity coming on throughout this year as in into early next year. So, it\u2019s a combination of both, Derik. Derik DeBruin : But you do feel confident that you\u2019ll be able to backfill. Is that, I mean, essentially every question I\u2019m getting from investors is like are you and other companies that are supplying to the COVID vaccine market going to have this big gap in \u201823 as things roll off? Eric Green : No. we will be able to utilize the existing equipment and future equipment we\u2019re installing right now because the approach we took on bringing customers towards the highest part of our growth in the portfolio so we can absorb that as we go into 2023 and 2024 if trajectory is changed around vaccinations. Bernard Birkett : Yes. and this is something that we you know in communicating throughout 2020 and 2021, as we layer in this extra capacity, it\u2019s not truly for COVID, it\u2019s for both core and COVID and even if there was a slight lag, it would be for a very short time based on the order book and the forecast that we have. So, we\u2019re relatively confident that we can use that capacity and pretty quickly as soon as it comes on board. Derik DeBruin : Great. I\u2019ve got some more, but I\u2019ll shut up and let somebody else ask. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just some more topic, I\u2019ll think maybe a different angle at it. Just to me it looks like I\u2019m kind of encouraged by the CapEx expansion up to $380 million; it\u2019s a pretty significant number and a good bump up from last year. So, to me that demonstrates some good confidence on your outlook and also I guess pumping up the long-term outlook by a 100 bips, I guess enough sort of from a current where we stand today, right, historically. So, I\u2019m kind of confident and confident about that but I\u2019m just trying to figure just this CapEx expansion. It sounds like it\u2019s more non-COVID related base business stuff and is it also is there a big chunk of that related to Corning, can you give us a little more visibility on Corning and also how that ties in with you sort of mentioned expansion and in on R&D which has been like 2% running about 2% a year. Is that do we should we expect that to bump up significantly as a percent of revenue going forward? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So, a couple of things there. So, on the CapEx, some of that CapEx is still around COVID and a lot of which you write it around also supporting the base business and is particularly targeted as a high value product area. So, what we would say getting close to 70% of our CapEx is growth based at this point. And on Corning, yes we are making some investments around that. We expect that to be around $50 million CapEx in the year. We\u2019ll go and laying our R&D, we will have a step-up in R&D also around Corning. And again, that\u2019s all baked into the forecast. Larry Solow : In terms of COVID and I realize this still our question works. But it sounds like you certainly expect growth this year. Did you get any feel for what your customers see going out of the next few years, obviously there\u2019s a lot of question marks but any feel for that? And second question there, is there been any as the therapeutics and we\u2019re probably the vaccines have evolved and is there any been any changes in packaging from sort of initial stages, or they are your customers looking more-and-more for your services and products. Can you give us any color on that? Eric Green : Well Larry, so what we\u2019re seeing right now is that you\u2019re right, we were initially providing solutions around the vials. And they were multiple doses per vial and we\u2019re seeing this transition in lifecycle management as we speak. And starting in 2022, it\u2019s the less doses per vial. So, it\u2019s a different type of solution that we provide some more economics from a unit basis but it\u2019s more of a transition less doses per vial which is a net positive for West. And the transition will take place, it is not perfectly in the calendar year but it\u2019s been 2022 going into 2023. The next stage after that and that\u2019s where Bernard was talking about some of the capital. It\u2019s still pointing towards back scenes as more towards prefilled syringes and so that is a scenario where we\u2019re so investing because that\u2019s more of a one or two year our type of the start of a transition for our customers. So, I hope they kind of get you this kind of landscape and helping to evolve for the next several years to the lifecycle. Larry Solow : Yes. I appreciate that, that\u2019s good call. Just last question if I may. Speaking of that, it\u2019s just on the price increases you mentioned I think it was about just below 2% price, any favor this quarter. I just look at that in light of I think supply chain impacts inflationary pressures. Certainly you guys are probably built has good or better than most companies frankly probably that in the world, they\u2019re not just in your industry. But obviously there is some inflation out there but particularly the oil and resin and stuff. So, deal price increases, should we expect these to maybe bump up a little bit over time, have you and then short term or have you been increasing prices a little bit to some customers to sort of offset some of these inflationary pressures? Bernard Birkett : Yes. We have the opportunity based on some of the contracts and agreements are in place to increase some of those price increases to cover some of these inflationary pressures. And so that that\u2019s within our wheelhouse to do that. And that is something that we have been doing towards backend of 2021 and we would I\u2019m going to see that here again in 2022. Larry Solow : Okay, great. Bernard Birkett : It\u2019s also the opportunity for us to and apply surcharges and certain instances where we see some specific inflationary pressure. Larry Solow : Right. Okay, great. I appreciate, thank you guys. Bernard Birkett : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is open. John Kreger : Hi, thanks very much. Eric, I appreciate the update on the long-term growth construct. Can you just talk about how you think about longer-term CapEx around that same construct? Should we be thinking that CapEx is sort of a percent of revenue around the sales perhaps declining after the big bullets in the last few years? Just how are you thinking about that number? Eric Green : That John, we are looking at a once we get through this bullets that we\u2019re currently managing through, we do want to get back to these 6% to 7% of sales and revenues. We do believe that is appropriate for that type of business, particularly we think about above 30% of our CapEx is around maintenance let\u2019s call it 10% 15% around our digital and then balance of this is on growth. So, we do believe that construct -- last year this year is really around the growth sector. And making sure that we have installed capacity. I will tell you when I\u2019m also very pleased in how the team has right sized facility network. As you know years ago, we had 29, we are at 25, and we\u2019re able to leverage those facilities more efficiently. So, the capital we\u2019re putting in is more around equipment and processes versus land and buildings. So, either teams done a very well very good job in that regard. And we\u2019re able to leverage and we\u2019re well-positioned for the future. Bernard Birkett : Yes, just on that, John. In previous year as it because we looked at the split of capital maintenance was 40% to 50% of the CapEx budgets. And so then obviously the remainder was on growth and IT. And now you\u2019re seeing the growth portion close to 70% and the thing with that as well as Eric just said, as soon as that CapEx hits our facility, it\u2019s straight into operations, we\u2019re getting the return on a much quicker and some of the CapEx investments we would have made a number of years ago just given the nature of them. And so, it\u2019s responding to demand, since you\u2019re responding as fast as we can and with this no increase capital allocation over the 2020, 2021, and into 2022. It should normalize and be on that. John Kreger : Got it, thank you. And then, a follow-up, Eric, I think you said at the beginning of the call, the order book was at a director level which sounds good. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that and I\u2019m thinking kind of two things. As you think about biologics versus generics versus pharma, what is that order book sort of tell you in terms of growth trajectory there. And also with tight supply chains, has your order book duration sort of extended or is it pretty typical today versus a year or two ago? Eric Green : So, it was two dynamics were happening. One is, I\u2019ll take the latter one first because I think you\u2019re right. What we\u2019re seeing is well the number has increased. We don\u2019t specifically spelt the number but its increase what we\u2019re seeing it\u2019s we have better visibility beyond the four or five quarters. So, it\u2019s for almost a two year horizon now. And one of the levers that will work with customers on is working with the supply chains working together to get that visibility so we can level load our operations more efficiently and be more effective and supports our customers. And at the other area, when you think about what if you kind of break it out of the increase, it really comes down to three buckets really. One is increase on the demand on around vaccines, another increase which I\u2019m very pleased about is quite different than it was let\u2019s say three or four years ago particularly in biologics. Is really a success of various drug launches for our clients or customers, I won\u2019t get into specifics and that\u2019s not just one but it\u2019s many. And then the third driver really is what I call the core growth in that is encompassing biologic results encompassing what we call pharma are small molecules and also generics. So, bottom line is all areas are growing nicely as for the more -- we waited for biologics, was a lot of drug successes we\u2019re seeing. And but again if you look at our CapEx profile, what we\u2019re putting into our facilities today it\u2019s the higher end of the HVP switch squarely goes after the biologic space. John Kreger : That\u2019s helpful, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Your line is open. Jacob Johnson : Hi, thanks. This maybe a little bit repetitive based on that last answer but I\u2019ll ask anyways. I mean, yes I\u2019ve considerable participation rate. I\u2019m just curious are you seeing a change in market share, your market share pre-imposed COVID. You are talking about mid-teens growth hedged over this year. You just bumped up your long-term growth outlook. Is this the market in biologics or are you taking share and is it kind of growth in those higher value products. Maybe it\u2019s all debugged but just curious kind of on the robust growth you guys are pointing to in this next year and beyond? Eric Green : Hi, Jacob. So, it\u2019s actually all of the above. So, what we\u2019re seeing as our participation rate is in biologics, we continue to be well north of 90%. And actually, I\u2019m very pleased on our performance in 2021 particularly when you look at in particular VLA was approved that then really use our types of products, it was more in different configuration. So, we look at that as an opportunity. And in the small molecule area, and we see about ANDAs were equal or slightly better and we were pre-COVID. And I would argue that pre-COVID if you look in step couple of years before that or even stronger than that. So, it as you\u2019ve seen a gradual improvement as we go forward. I\u2019m really excited about this partnership and where we\u2019re talking HVP to the next level because that again reinforces our leadership position and really bring in new technologies to the market that really de-risks our customer\u2019s process in entering the market. Jacob Johnson : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe following-up on de-risking the process. I think in December, the FDA put out some guidance on visible particular from this periods it effects something that could be a catalyst for you all or maybe it\u2019s nothing. Just curious on that? Eric Green : It helps us. Any time there is higher level quality requirements and our regulatory changes our direction that they would like to go. That puts us in a varied position, also our partner Daikyo in a very good position because we do have solutions that can rebuild standards and it could be adoption of existing molecules in the market but also the new pipeline. But to your point, the biggest catalyst of this relationship we built with Corning is all around regulatory changes towards combination devices and our systems versus individual components. So, it is very good for West as these regulatory changes become more stringent as we go forward. Jacob Johnson : Got it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks for taking the questions. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. On the commentary earlier regarding the trend toward pre-filled syringes, is this not where biotechnology industry wants to go, meaning the it\u2019s not just COVID vaccines which I\u2019m sure they want to do that as well but is that not kind of a primary driver for biotechnology customers right now and why I guess the other question. Eric Green : Yes, absolutely. Paul, so there is a push towards pre-filled syringes in multiple dimensions, right, if think about the biologics space and also you think about the vaccines themselves for easier distribution administering patients is and et cetera. So, there is a push towards technology that supports advancements of pre-filled syringes. And I think again that\u2019s the reason why we have a really good offer now between Crystal Zenith is an alternative for glass but also with working partnering with Corning. It does eliminate at the end of the day like you say it limits risk from going away from the vial. Paul Knight : And then, when we talk about capacity editions, from the initiation of spending, how long before projects are running and delivering revenue. Is it a year, is it two years, how long is it? Eric Green : Yes. It\u2019s a combination of two things. Let me try to frame that because it\u2019s been so good point you\u2019re raising. One point is once these equipment lands in our facility and we\u2019re able to validate, we\u2019re talking matter of weeks before we have an equipment up and running. And frankly, based on a digital connectivity to all our equipment across the globe, you will see that utilization go shoot up right up to the 80+% of range. But the point that will be conscious of is that when we talked about investments in 2020, is I think it\u2019s two phases we spoke of, I would say a little over to three forces of over 75% of those already in place in producing finished product. And the rest of that delta is can be completed early on in 2022. The other investments we initiated in 2021 called Phase 3 and Phase 4, I would say today where we stand is about 15% complete or 20% installed and producing finished product And the balance of that is planned to be completed throughout 2022 and the early 2023. So, based on our commitments what we made and our customers future demand, that\u2019s kind of the cadence we\u2019re seeing with these investments and how long does it take for the equipment to be built to be delivered and then installed. And that could take anywhere between a few months to two or three quarters depending on the equipment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dave Windley : Hi thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question I think John and Jacob have both asked slightly differently. Your long-term growth construct on revenue in particular, could you talk about contributors their expectations for growth between proprietary products and contract manufacturing. I was just asking because contract manufacturing has kind of fluctuated quite a bit. I\u2019m wondering if your thoughts about the relative contributors to that 1% increase might be a little different than just 1%? Eric Green : Yes. I will start and Bern if you want to add to it. You\u2019re right. The driver behind that really is around our proprietary business more so than contract manufacturing. I think we look at contract manufacturing, you\u2019re right we\u2019re seeing as we indicated some volatility is based on contracts in timing to ramp up of new agreements. So, when we look at proprietary, we do believe that stronger or robust and you had historically and it\u2019s really around the biologics is the main driver. We do still believe in the small molecule space roughly it\u2019s called low-to-mid single, mid-single from the pharma side and then generics is meant to high single on the construct perspective. And then biologics is in the double digits. And now that biologics is the bigger piece of our business, approximately over 40% let\u2019s say and it\u2019s driven by high value products and higher end of that portfolio, that\u2019s the reason why we have very strong confidence to our leads raised by that 100 basis points that we spoke of. Bern, do you want to add more color? Bernard Birkett : It ties in with the discussion we had on CapEx. So, you can see where we\u2019re investing a lot of our capital around high value products and that is now the primarily primary growth driver in then the business and then specifically within biologics. But you could also see in what we\u2019ve seen here in 2021 that we\u2019re seeing HVP uptake in the other market units as well in generics and pharma. So, that\u2019s now starting to permeate the rest of the business which is a positive info as well. So, when we then look at contract manufacturing and the growth there is probably mid-single digits and maybe at the lower end of our construct. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen particularly over the last year and probably the back half of 2020. And so, from a mix perspective, it\u2019s we get a much was a much better return on those investments we\u2019re making, so that that way we can try off from it. Dave Windley : Excellent. So, if I then stick on a proprietary product, I mean you again probably touched on pieces of this but probably any one of those is -- any one of biologics been a higher portion of that pie and growing faster a higher adoption of the high end of your high value products, so kind of richer mix, maybe some underlying volume growth from a stronger pipeline in last several years. Any one of those seems like it\u2019s probably might be worth 1% on its own. Is it a combination of all of those things or does one of those things stand out? Eric Green : It\u2019s a combination. And we\u2019re seeing the very strong demand across all of the market units and you can see that\u2019s reflected in the guidance how we get in for 2022 around our proprietary business. Now that we\u2019re guiding in their mid-teens and so, it is a combination of different drivers that just doesn\u2019t hang on one thing. Dave Windley : Yes. And then switching subjects a little bit on in Corning and Valor, certainly the system approach that you\u2019re talking about makes some sense. My understanding is that maybe that\u2019s been the case in the industry that you would source a variety of solution or parts of solutions and put those together in go-to market. Perhaps you could talk about the context there and then also what drove you to choose Corning and Valor in particular and how long do you think it takes to develop one of these solutions that you\u2019re talking about to bring to market? Thanks. Eric Green : Hi, Dave. So, there\u2019s first of all we have a history of a really strong partnership with Daikyo. So, as we enter into this relationship with Corning, we\u2019re very confident we can create a similar model. You\u2019re right, the reason why we engage in those conversations is when we speak with our customers, the challenges they face usually try to find the right called the containment solution for the products. And what they find is it\u2019s highly fragmented and is our patchwork environment of multiple suppliers. So, when we really think about it and you look at the elastomers and glass, there is several Drug Master Files solutions that need to be supplied with that particular drug molecule. And the release maybe after that has been able to develop a truly integrated system from ground up. So, when we looked at to think about ourselves and Daikyo, we do believe we put ourselves as the leading innovators around elastomers and primary packaging. And when you think about unparalleled glass science and the deep material science capability at Corning which is well known in multiple industries but in our industry in pharma. And they also have deep manufacturing and engineering capabilities which is truly unique. That\u2019s why as we sat down and talked about the partnership, the focus is really to redefine the future of containment solutions and then really create naturally integrated system. That de-risks what I\u2019ve said earlier about our customer\u2019s drug development and manufacturing processes with a single product one DMF and end-to-end support for our customers by West. So, that\u2019s the premise why we have embarked on this relationship. And this is utilizing glass technology between borosilicate which has been in the industry for decades. And the newly developed aluminosilicate that Corning has developed really to provide a range of quality benefits. So, what I\u2019m trying to articulate is the leveraging that partnership with them truly enables us to get to the best in quality first in class system in the industry between the two firms. And leveraging obviously we see two firms, Daikyo and West together from the elastomer side. So, hopefully that gives you the kind of an appreciation of what we\u2019re embarking on now. As you know, if you think about the NovaPure journey that we were on and other new launches we had here at West, our lands on the biologic pipeline is very good. And so, that\u2019s the area that we\u2019ll focus on and as we characterize and truly get to that system approach we are between the two firms we need to add additional capital, manufacturing capabilities, full both see the documentation and driven by data, scientific data for our customers, we do believe it\u2019s going to take a little bit of a time and that should probably get to that point. So, just like NovaPure took a few years to get penetration and now you\u2019re seeing the benefits, we see similar type of characteristics with a system approach. We\u2019ll start with -- will have vials, we\u2019ll have pre-filled syringes, and we\u2019ll have cartridges at the end of the day. Dave Windley : Great. That\u2019s helpful perspective. Thank you. Eric Green : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. I will now like to turn the call back over to Quintin for closing remarks.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning\u2019s earnings release. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to West\u2019s CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on slide five. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong first quarter. This is driven by double-digit organic sales growth with increasing demand for our high value products. Our confirmed order book for the rest of 2022 and into 2023 remains as strong as ever, primarily driven by non-COVID based business. And to provide you more color, over half of the order book is coming from biologics demand. These results were delivered despite several macro-economic challenges that are impacting all companies and sectors. We've taken pro proactive measures to mitigate the risk of these challenges and ensure the continuity of critical components to our customers. For example, inflation, we're adjusting our pricing strategy and have enacted surcharges as a pass through to offset increasing costs of raw materials, energy and transportation. Supply chain, our raw material and proprietary medical device components are sourced from across the globe. We have increased our inventory of these key raw materials to minimize any supply disruption. And we continue to execute and monitor our business continuity plans with respect to these issues, including the war in Ukraine and the recent pandemic surge in China. Turning to slide six, our team members across the globe continue to demonstrate their passion to improve patient lives as they remain focused on our strategic initiatives of execute, innovate, and grow. Starting with the first pillar of execute, we continue to deliver the key drivers of growth in Q1 with strong customer demand of HVP components including NovaPure and Weststar. There was solid demand in the quarter across all market units and a positive outlook remains for the rest of the year. And in particular, for our biologics market segment, which is now greater than 42% of our total sales. We see both existing and new customers continue to spec our highest level of components by West or our partner Daikyo for sensitive molecules. Our capital spending investments through expansions and optimizing productivity across the global operations remain on track. To-date, almost all of our 2020 expansion phases have been installed, validated, and in production and we're making good progress on the 2021 capital expansion plans, some of which will come online in the second half of 2022 and throughout 2023. With the accelerated biologics demand for NovaPure, we have executed digital support for NovaPure future demand as well as other HVP finishing capabilities. Expansion construction is underway and will be online towards the back half of this year with commercial production, and 2023. Shifting into West team of scientific and technical experts, we continue to educate and share insights in biologics, combination products, and container closure integrity, which are priority areas in pharmaceutical packaging. At the recent PDA Annual Meeting, several of our West experts were recipients of prestigious awards. Now, to innovate, we need to feel innovation to develop future products, solutions, and services that connect the dots across science and technology to create customer value. We're doing so by investing in external opportunities that complement our current business needs, such as our partnership with Tekion to create a research center of excellence in combination with West Scientific expertise. The Corning collaboration as we expand our HVP value proposition to lead the industry from components to a truly integrated system of Elastomer and glass. And building technologies like the recent collaboration with Numa Systems to develop a family of Fluid Flow technologies for drug delivery. I'm pleased on the progress our R&D team is making around innovate. Moving to the final pillar grow, which includes uses of cash. We're working from a position of strength as we believe we have a long horizon of continued strong organic sales growth and margin expansion. As we have demonstrated, over the past two years, we have increased our capital spending for capacity expansion at existing sites across our global network to support our organic growth initiatives. In addition, we have made inorganic investments, such as partnerships with Corning. Our continued focus within these three strategic pillars; execute, innovate, and grow, allows us to be more responsive, leverage our assets more effectively, and support the trends that are happening in the industry today. This was most evident from our recent site visits in Dublin and Waterford, Ireland. For example, in Dublin, I saw firsthand how the digitalization of our manufacturing technologies is providing real-time data, enabling our team to raise the bar in operational performance with higher yields and efficiencies. At Waterford, the capital investments over the last year and a half have significantly increased capacity with additional lines producing HVP product to meet increased demand. And we're seeing early success with our next-generation fully integrated automation that we believe will scale and transfer across the network for a combined benefit of higher quality production and higher manufacturing throughput. Lastly, and proudly, the hard work of our Waterford team was acknowledged by the Ireland-U.S. Council as we received the Global Public Service Award for our commitment during the pandemic. Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2022 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance in our Biologics and Pharma market units. I will take you through the profit growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2022 guidance. First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on slide seven, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in slides 15 to 18. We recorded net sales of $720 million, representing organic sales growth of 11%. Looking at slide eight. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 14.4% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 73% of Proprietary Products sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across Biologics and Pharma market units in Q1. Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The Generics market unit experienced mid-single-digit growth, led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. Our Pharma market unit saw high single-digit growth with sales, led by high-value products, including Daikyo and NovaPure components. And Contract Manufacturing declined 3.8% for the first quarter due to a reduction in sales of components for diagnostic devices. We recorded $284.6 million in gross profit, $12.7 million or 4.7% above Q1 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 39.5% was a 100 basis point decline from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $189.9 million recorded this quarter compared to $179.2 million in the same period last year or a 6% increase. However, our adjusted operating profit margin of 26.4% was a 30 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.12 in Q1, EPS grew by approximately 15%. So let's review the drivers in both revenue and profit. On slide nine, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $49.9 million or 7.4 percentage points of growth. And sales price increases contributed $23.6 million or 3.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Looking at margin performance. Slide 10 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 39.5% for Q1 2022, slightly down from 40.5% in Q1 2021. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 43.4% was 290 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2021. The decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin was caused by several factors, including lower levels of absorption during the early part of the quarter due to short-term labor constraints, increases in raw material and overhead costs. In addition, our 2021 gross profit margin included approximately 150 basis points of benefit in the prior year associated with onetime fees from COVID and other supply agreements, which did not reoccur in the first quarter of 2022. These fees had approximately 160 basis points of benefit on Q1 2021 operating margin. Contract Manufacturing first quarter gross profit margin of 20.1% was 440 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2021. The increase in margin is largely attributed to pass-through of inflationary costs and components in the quarter. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On slide 11, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $151.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $62.5 million compared to the same period last year, 70.5% increase. Our operating cash flow in the period benefited from our working capital performance. Our first quarter 2022 year-to-date capital spending was $65.8 million, $11.1 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1.1 billion at March 31, 2022, decreased slightly by $42.2 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to the net reduction of our cash, offset by an increase in inventory levels. Our cash balance at March 31 of $667.7 million was $94.9 million lower than our December 2021 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx, offset by our strong operating results in the period. Turning to guidance. Slide 12 provides a high-level summary. We are reaffirming our full year 2022 net sales guidance. We expect net sales to be in a range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion. There is an estimated FX headwind of $115 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to a prior estimated headwind of $70 million. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We expect our full year 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $9.30 to $9.45 compared to a prior range of $9.20 to $9.35. This revised guidance includes first quarter $0.12 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Also, our CapEx guidance remains at $380 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an increased impact of approximately $0.38 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to a prior estimated headwind of $0.21. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter : strong top line growth in proprietary, growth in operating profit, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on slide 13, our execution in Q1 has positioned us well for the year ahead. We continue to have a strong base business despite the current macro environment in which we operate. We remain well-positioned with the right market-led strategy around execute, innovate and grow. We have a robust book of committed orders with momentum in 2022 and continuing into 2023. We continue to realize the benefits of our global operating model, and we're continuing to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. With great pride, we realize the criticality of our products for health care across the globe, which is why our purpose to improve patient lives propels us each and every day. Didi, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Please proceed. Larry Solow : Great. Good morning. Did you give the -- real quick housekeeping question. Did you give the COVID sales -- COVID-related sales number? Did I miss that? Bernard Birkett : We didn't call it out, but it was approximately $110 million, which shows growth over Q1 2021. Larry Solow : Got it. So, there's no change to this year's outlook for that, it sounds like. Okay. Just on the cost side, clearly, everybody is facing these varying degrees of -- from inflation and supply chain issues, and you guys have done a fabulous job offsetting a lot of them, I think. But obviously, you can only offset so much. I'm just curious what the surcharges you put in today, weren't you already kind of -- is this just sort of expediting increases to keep up with the rapid -- the fluid situation with the costs coming up? I know, normally, I think, you have like kickers in there when you're selling -- in a lot of your contracts. Is this more of a broader-based, more aggressive reaction to some of these inflationary issues? Eric Green : Yes. Larry, there's two elements. You're right, on the Contract Manufacturing side of our business, which is a little bit less than 20%, we do have -- with our agreements with our customers, we are passing on inflationary costs for the most part, whether it's raw materials and et cetera. On the proprietary side, that's more of a recent phenomenon. There's two elements of that though. One is we've mentioned before that we are revisiting our pricing strategy, and we started executing upon that last year, building up for this year. So we're seeing the element of more long-term pricing strategy around value capture that is now coming into the equation. In addition to that, in the proprietary business, we have implemented surcharges as well. And that typically is really around transportation and increase in raw materials. So there's two levers that have occurred. But I just want to be very clear that there is an element that underlying base price increase strategy is now being rolled into the ongoing business. Larry Solow : Okay. And was this kind of just enacted at the beginning of this year, I guess? And I assume there's some kind of a lag, right? I mean margins were down a little bit. I know year-over-year, there was some more -- you had this onetime -- $12 million onetime payment. I know that's skewed the margins. But even if we look sequentially, margins are down a little bit, right? Is that mostly a function of these higher costs and maybe you can't offset all of them but hopefully maybe you get a little improvement as we look out, as you enact some of these surcharges? Bernard Birkett : It's partly related to the cost and the lag in passing them on, so it's not always instantaneous in the quarter. When you see the pricing or the cost increases, then we work with our customers to layer that in over time, and that's what we have been doing. And the other thing that we called out, Larry, as well, we did see some lower levels of absorption in the -- probably the first half of the quarter based on labor supply in one of our -- two of our plants, and that was a short-term blip, and we've seen the absorption levels get back to normal or where we would expect them to be in the latter half of the quarter. But again, that does impact margin in the short-term. Larry Solow : Right. Yes. That was kind of my next question. Was -- other than the cost impact and the labor issue you called out as sort of temporary, are you guys having any major or increasing problems just retaining labor or supply chain issues or you've been able to sort of -- even though things are not getting any better, I know? Bernard Birkett : I wouldn't think there's increasing problems retaining labor. It has been challenging, I think, for everybody, but we haven't seen any spike in that. So we have a number of initiatives with our HR teams to make sure we have the labor in the right places. So it wasn't really around retention problem. So that's -- long term, that's not a big issue for us. And then if you look at the implied guidance, we are forecasting operating margin expansion. And to do that, we have to be able to do gross margin expansion at the same time to feed into it. So we believe some of these short-term impacts we saw at the really early part of the year are kind of now behind us. Larry Solow : Okay. Okay, great. And then just last question on -- just back to the COVID. Any -- obviously, there's a lot -- it's a quickly changing situation. But it sounds like for you guys, again, we've talked about it, it's not a matter of overall volume but sort of that shift in life cycle management. Have you seen any incremental evidence that this is occurring? Or any thoughts, any update on that front? Eric Green : What we can share with you is that we are seeing the -- more of the forecasting looking later into 2022 of a shift from larger vial configuration to a smaller vial configuration. But that hasn't flown into our operations as we speak today, but that's more forecasted. We're working with our customers throughout the year. Larry Solow : Right. Okay, great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lin of William Blair. Please proceed. Justin Lin : Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess Repligen came out yesterday and saw COVID vaccine cancellations and orders have been pushed to 2023, at least some of it -- some of them. I guess what are you seeing in your order books? And if you could share your outlook for COVID, both short-term and long term, that would be great. Eric Green : Well, two ways to look at it. One is, if we think about for 2022, our confirmed order book for the balance of the year, as we mentioned earlier, it's a very -- it's much stronger than it was the same time period as last year. But if you split that out, the COVID ratio within that larger order book is relatively the same as -- is relatively steady as it was last year. Really, the expansion of that order book is really heavy around the HVP, and also due to -- over half of it is due to the success of various drug launches in our biologics space. So there are some COVID-19 customers that are adjusting their forecast, but overall, we're seeing a steady flow throughout the balance of the year. Justin Lin : Got it. So you're currently not sort of changing your outlook for 2023, it sounds like? Eric Green : No, we're not based on what we -- current conversations with customers. Justin Lin : Got it. And I think your margins, both gross and operating, came slightly below The Street. Can you help us think through how much of that is product mix versus currency versus supply chain headwinds? I think gross profit is a bit lower than you're used to seeing, but some of that is offset by a lower SG&A spend as well. Bernard Birkett : Yes. So on the gross margin, really, what I called out earlier in response to Larry's question, part of that was on the lower levels of absorption that we did see in the first half of the quarter. Again, that was more of a onetime event. And what we're actually seeing in operating margin, if you look at our business on a normalized basis, if you back off the one-time take-or-pay that we got in Q1 2021 and compare operating results excluding that, operating margin would have expanded by about 130 basis points. So that -- it had a 160 basis point impact on operating margin. So that -- so when we look out for the balance of the year, we are forecasting continued operating margin expansion. So that comp made it very, very difficult to expand the margin in that period. Justin Lin : That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much. Bernard Birkett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Knight of KeyBanc. Please proceed. Paul Knight : Hi Eric, your $380 million of CapEx obviously shows, I guess, a very strong building book for biologics ex COVID. Can you talk about 42% of biologics -- of sales are biologics this year? What was it last year? And can you talk about what you're seeing that's driving your CapEx levels? Eric Green : Yes. So when you look at it, Paul, it's less than 40%, and we're seeing the biologics become a larger piece of the -- obviously, it's the largest unit today but with the highest growth even ex COVID in the equation. And so when you think about our investments that we're currently making, a lot of the capital -- over 70% of the capital is really growth orientated, which I think historically was probably closer to the 50th percentage. And it's really focused around NovaPure and FluroTec, particularly plungers and stoppers. And what we're seeing is really a buildup -- as we talked earlier about, the capital that we're spending in the last couple of years really is -- was already built in our five-year plan, and we're just bringing it forward to support the COVID vaccines. But now what we're seeing is that the demand on the biologics continues to increase and accelerate. And I mentioned a little bit earlier, but just to reiterate, I mean, if I look at the details of the confirmed order book, over half of it is of drug molecules in market that we're seeing a ramp-up or acceleration of adoption. And so -- and it's not just one molecule, it's many. So we're seeing that pull effect of increasing volume out of West to support those -- the continuation of the drug in the supply chain. So we're very, very excited to see the focus around biologics, the high penetration of successes of new BLAs or NMEs. And our participation is -- remains very, very high, and this is the impact that we're seeing. Paul Knight : And regarding the Corning JV, what's -- I know you've indicated CapEx of $15 million, but what's the multiyear kind of timeline in your view with that JV? Eric Green : Well, the investments are more in the next couple of years. I mean it's a very long-term arrangement. We will have various launches over the next couple of years, starting this year, 2022, of new solutions to customers. But these investments will take place on the capital side over the next couple of years to increase capacity, particularly around prefilled syringe. Bernard Birkett : Yes. So that's going to be a number of years before we see from a revenue and profitability perspective. That's not immediate. So it's going to take time to build that out. But in the interim, there are other configurations, as Eric said, that we're putting together, but they won't be overly material on our numbers in the short-term. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson of Stephens. Please proceed. Jacob Johnson : Hey thanks. Good morning. Maybe first, just a couple of clarifying questions. First, on the COVID side, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like your expectations for 2022 on the revenues there are unchanged. But has the composition of those revenues changed? Are you assuming -- it sounds like maybe the back half of the year you're going to get maybe a little more of a benefit from a configuration change. Is it fair to say that maybe the composition of those revenues have shifted versus prior expectations? Eric Green : No, I think it's pretty consistent. I think what we're seeing is, absolutely, when you do life cycle management, different vial configuration, there will be a change, and that was really more towards the back half of the year. But when we look at the growth orientation of where we are today and look at balance of 2022, the ex-COVID or the non-COVID-related growth will outpace the COVID growth. And as you recall, last year and the year before, it was really quick acceleration because of our response in the market. But it's more steady -- can't quite say steady state. It's more of a lower end but still growth overall for West. But the higher element of growth in proprietary is definitely going to come from, right now our view is, non-COVID related. Jacob Johnson : Okay, got it. Thanks for that Eric. And Bernard, just on the decline in gross margin sequentially, it sounds like this was largely related to labor and absorption. And if I heard you correct, it sounds like that was the first half of the quarter, and that's been resolved. So is it fair to assume that we should see gross margins kind of bounce back now that that's over with as we think 2Q and beyond? Bernard Birkett : Yes. And that's implied in the guidance, that, that -- for that to happen. And we're confident that, that will take place. And as Eric has alluded, we're continuing to see very strong growth within biologics and that mix shift within our business, and that drives a lot of that margin improvement. And we're also picking up various levels of efficiencies throughout our operations. So we would expect to see margins continue to improve throughout the year. Jacob Johnson : Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question, kind of getting to the point, I think, you both want to make. Eric, you mentioned a long horizon of organic growth. I guess the question there, what would be helpful? Just remind us kind of where high-value product units stand in terms of percentage of units today, what that number looks like and maybe how that could -- what that could look like maybe five years from now. Eric Green : Yes. If you think about the algorithm that we have with greater than 70% of our sales in proprietary is high-value products, the units -- number of units that we are producing for high-value products is roughly around 22%, 23%. And the way it works is about 100 basis point expansion on units is strong double-digit growth on high-value products. If you think about how biologics is becoming a larger portion of the portfolio, again, across many different customers, so it's not really concentrated on one customer or one drug, it's across the whole portfolio of the market, that will continuously drive higher revenues, higher profits with not a lot of increase on units per se, 100, 100-plus basis points. So, that's the equation, and we expect that to continue. It's the fastest growing subsegment within injectable medicine space. The pipeline is very robust. It was very encouraging to see the number of new approvals over the last 12, 18 months in this particular space, and our participation rate is as high as ever. So all this equates to -- and it translates into our confirmed order book for future launches. So this all translates into continued growth for the next five years of HVP for West. Jacob Johnson : Perfect. I'll leave it there. Thanks for taking the questions. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Please proceed. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning everyone. Eric Green : Good morning Derik. Derik De Bruin : I just jumped on so my apologies if I'm going to repeat some stuff. But can you just sort of talk about the organic revenue growth guide? You're a little bit below in our numbers in the first quarter, yet you're raising it for 1% to 2% for the full year like that, which is surprising given the Q1. Can you just sort of walk through me -- can you just sort of walk through the math on your confidence as we're getting that increase given the start? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So. the -- when we look at it, and it goes back to the point I made earlier about the absorption rates that we experienced in the first half of the year due to some of our labor constraints and that was primarily around Omicron, it impacted us in one or -- in a couple of different sites. Again, that was a short-term problem. That impacts our ability to produce in the short-term, so then that kind of leads into some impact on our revenues in the first quarter. So it's not that we're seeing a drop or a shift in our demand downwards. It's mainly what we could actually produce in the quarter and deliver to customers. So that was a little bit light. But as Eric said, our order book is still very, very strong. And we also had -- when we had spoken earlier on in the year, we were saying we were going to see more of our growth to come in the back half of the year versus the first, and that's still what we're seeing. So there's really no change. Derik De Bruin : Great. That's really helpful, and I didn't catch that. Have you -- I've got a couple of clients asking. Can you just sort of confirm that you're looking for greater than 100 basis points of overall operating margin expansion this year? Bernard Birkett : Yes. And again, that's implied in the guidance. So it will be greater than 100 basis points. And getting back to the point I made earlier, if you look at the fundamentals of the business, if you take that take-or-pay that we had in Q1 2021, if you back that out and then look at the comp on that basis, operating margin would have expanded about 130 basis points. So from a comp point of view, you had that level of challenge here in the first quarter. So when I look at that, it gives me confidence to be able to say yes, we are going to continue to expand that operating margin. Derik De Bruin : Do you think the production constraints are largely alleviated now? Eric Green : I'll comment. I would say -- just based on the last couple of months of performance, I would say yes. I mean there's always challenges in this environment today. The couple of plants that Bernard is referring to, we were hit hard on the Omicron, and that did impact absorption. That also impacted productivity. But over the last couple of months, looking at the productivity levels, the output, we do believe we have a very good control around this and we're able to build flex to make sure that we're able to deliver going forward. But it was a short-term hit. Bernard Birkett : Yes. So we did see improvement as we moved through the quarter. And we're forecasting that to continue based on what's in place now. Derik De Bruin : Great. And I've got some people asking on your China exposure and just sort of any commentary in that region. Has that been a headwind to the business at all? Eric Green : Yes. So our operations was impacted in the sense that our Qingpu manufacturing facility is within the region of Shanghai and obviously, our offices, too. So we did have a site closure for a short period of time, and we're working through that now. As far as materiality for West, it's very low percentage for West coming out of that facility for the local market. But we're keeping an eye on it, making sure that we can pivot and potentially import where necessary versus having materials coming out of that specific site. We do expect to see a recovery in this quarter with the demand, but we need to stay tuned because that's kind of a dynamic environment right now. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Dave Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on Derik and several of the other questions -- line of questioning around the capacity. Wondering if your absorption commentary on productivity issues affected your ability to deliver to clients. Like should we think about revenue would have been higher in the quarter if you had been able to produce as much as you expected in those facilities? And like did the lag times to clients change at all? Bernard Birkett : Yes. It impacted it slightly, but it didn't really impact lead times overall. We were able to kind of get that product out to customers in the early part of this quarter. So there was -- we tried to minimize any customer impact. As we said, it happened earlier in the quarter, but there's no kind of long-term impact to that. It was a once-off, and it was something we've been able to deal with. And we've been able to continue supply to our customers. It did -- could impact revenues slightly but not overly material, I will put it that way. But there was some impact around that. Dave Windley : Okay. On the -- it seems -- as people have already highlighted the gross margin impact and somewhat offset by SG&A being a little lower, should we think about that SG&A level as durable? Is that a result of kind of some permanent productivity step-ups? Bernard Birkett : Yes, it is durable. It's productivity. And again, it is looking at what is the appropriate level for SG&A of our business. And that's something that we manage very, very tightly. Dave Windley : Okay. And then just somewhat longer-term question around capacity. I apologize, I'm probably not great at keeping up with all this, but you've pulled forward quite a bit of CapEx, not just kind of now but over the COVID period and have a number of initiatives in place to bring more capacity online. Could you just help us understand in broad strokes when those capacity expansions are supposed to hit? And I think it's mostly FluroTec and NovaPure, as you've highlighted, Eric. And then also confirm what you said in the past that you basically expect that capacity to be taken up by order demand right away; in other words, no dilution to productivity, absorption, et cetera, as you're bringing on slugs of new capacity. Eric Green : Yes. I'll take the last part first and say that we don't anticipate any impact if there's very variability around the COVID piece. Because if we look -- again, look at our -- the demand that we're getting with non-COVID related, particularly in the biologics space, which is -- overlaps 100% with the investments that we are putting in, the growth is actually -- is a little bit higher than we anticipated. So therefore, we're in a position we can absorb that. But to your first point, the initial launch that we communicated back in -- early on in the pandemic, let's just call it 2020, that investment is now finalized and in place and now through -- is producing commercial product this year. And it was kind of weaved in throughout 2021. So that's 100% installed. The second phase that we communicated really towards the early part of 2021, we're seeing that being layered in as we speak and might leak -- some parts of it, not all, a portion -- a small portion might go into 2023. But the focus of the remaining HVP is exactly what you stated. It's really focused around NovaPure and FluroTec capacity, and it is across multiple plants within our network. And again, it lines up very nicely with the growth in biologics, and it also does support pharma and generics but mostly biologics. And then growth in biologics in our order book is extremely strong as we speak today. So I'm pretty confident. Now we need to get that equipment in, installed, validated, and we've been doing a great job across the globe. We also need to add some resources to be able to run those -- the new equipment, and that is ongoing as we speak. So we're seeing a very good uptick in attracting new additional talent to our organization but also doing a good job of keeping in pace of the capital expansion. Dave Windley : Excellent. Appreciate those answers. Thank you. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Quintin Lai for further remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks Didi.

I now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to report that we delivered an excellent second quarter. We grew 13% organically with over 18% organic sales growth in our Proprietary Products segment. Our base business continues to have solid demand across all three market units : Biologics, Pharma and Generics, which more than offsets a slight decline in COVID-19-related sales. And again, our high-value products led the way to this impressive growth. Our continued success highlights the strength and the resilience of our proven strategy of execute, innovate, grow, which continues to set us apart as a trusted market leader. It is the strength of our One West team guided by our purpose that makes a meaningful difference in ensuring our customers have reliable supply of the components necessary to deliver drugs to patients. An example of our One West culture in action is our team members in China, who I would like to thank for their inspiring efforts and commitment to our customers during the lockdowns in April and May. The relentless focus in our purpose enabled us to reopen our sites and continue to serve our customers with minimal impact. Now moving to Slide 6. We made great progress in the second quarter. Let me briefly share a few highlights. We continue to deliver the key drivers of growth in Q2, primarily driven by our HVP components including NovaPure, Envision, Daikyo Crystal Zenith and self-injection devices. With a strong order book for our Biologics and Generics customers, along with Pharma demand ramping up, we are seeing the benefits of our capital spend investments as we optimize productivity across our global operations. Our 2020 capital expansion is now complete and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving forward to complete the installation of our 2021 expansion. Turning to Crystal Zenith. We have been expanding capacity of our 1 ml syringe as our customer uptake has been robust. At the 2022 Bile International Conference, we launched the Daikyo Crystal Zenith 2.25 ml insert needle syringe system with a market trend for large dose injections were able to answer the needs of more patients with the safe and reliable containment solution. The new CZ syringe system will help our customers bring a larger volume of product to patients with fewer or less frequent injections enabling an easier patient to experience. As we continue to advance, the standard of care for patients with our customers, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to share that we have a combination drug approved using our newly launched CZ 2.25 ml system with targeted customer launch in 2023. In addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing good progress with our SmartDose on-body subcu delivery system and now have three FDA-approved biologic drugs using our technology. Shifting to Slide 7 and an update on ESG. At the end of June, we published our 2021 corporate responsibility report on the company website. We are tracking well towards our five-year targets, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud of how our organization has connected our One West culture with our ESG initiatives. We know to fulfill our purpose effectively, we must progress our environmental sustainability goals, diversity and inclusion and success around our charitable efforts. Together, this makes for a better performing company today and into the future. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also pleased to share that yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors has elected Dr. Stephen Lockhart as our newest member. As the former Chief Medical Officer of Sutter Health in California, his expertise will be a valuable addition to our Board. Before I turn it over to Bernard, I want to provide some high-level thoughts on our updated full year outlook and implied second half 2022 guidance. We have two headwinds : FX and slowing COVID-19 demand. On the positive, not only has our base business been strong in the first half of the year, but we also expect the Generics and Pharma market units to perform even better in the second half of the year with additional resources to address the demand dynamics. For guidance, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking our overall sales down by $100 million for the full year. Incremental FX is going to be a $75 million headwind. In addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a decline in COVID-19 demand as compared to our April outlook that assumed modest growth over 2021. While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing some orders for stoppers for smaller vials to hold fewer doses, we do not assume a meaningful sales impact in 2022 and expect an overall decline of COVID-19 sales of 20% or $85 million from 2021 sales levels. To sum it up, changes in FX and COVID are causing headwinds well in excess of our $100 million negative change to full year sales guidance. On the positive side, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting even stronger base business growth in the second half of this year from all three market units of Biologics, Pharma and Generics that is helping to moderate the guidance impact. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it over our call to Bernard. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review the numbers in more detail. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll first look at Q2 2022 revenues and profits, where we saw another strong quarter of sales growth led by performance in our Biologics and Generics market units. I will take you through the profit drivers in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2022 guidance. First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 20. We recorded net sales of $771.3 million, representing organic sales growth of 13.1%. Looking at Slide 9. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 18.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 73% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double-digits and had solid momentum across Biologics and Generics market units in Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The Generics market unit also experienced strong double-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including NovaPure components. And contract manufacturing declined 8.9% for the second quarter due to a reduction in sales of components for diagnostic devices. We recorded $321.5 million in gross profit, $6.4 million or 2% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 41.7% was a 180 basis point decline from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $227 million recorded this quarter compared to $211.2 million in the same period last year for a 7.5% increase. And our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.4% was a 20 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew $0.01 for Q2, excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.01 in Q2, EPS grew by approximately 4%. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review the drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $71.7 million, or 9.9 percentage points of growth and sales price increases contributed $23.4 million or 3.2 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 41.7% for Q2 2022, down from 43.5% in Q2 2021. Proprietary Products\u00e2\u0080\u0099 second quarter gross profit margin of 46.2%, 360 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2021. The decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin was caused by inflationary pressures impacting all plant costs, including raw materials, labor and overheads. Partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds was improvement in our product mix, price increases and pass through surcharges and approximately 90 basis points of benefit associated with onetime fees from COVID supply agreements. Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 16.3% was 40 basis points below the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2021. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to mix of products sold in the period. Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at our balance sheet and review how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $324.3 million for the six months ended June 2022, an increase of $91.2 million compared to the same period last year, a 39.1% increase. Our operating cash flow in the period benefited from increased earnings, our working capital performance and timing of income tax payments. Our second quarter 2022 year-to-date capital spending was $131.9 million, $20.3 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1.2 billion at June 30, 2022, increased by $58.1 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory offset by reductions in our cash. Our cash balance at June 30, $718.5 million, was $44.1 million lower than our December 2021 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx offset by our strong operating cash flow in the period. Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full year 2022 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.95 billion and $2.975 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $190 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to a prior estimated headwind of $115 million. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 11% compared to prior guidance of approximately 11% to 12%. We expect our full year 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $9 to $9.15 compared to a prior range of $9.30 to $9.45. This revised guidance includes our first half $0.13 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Also, our CapEx guidance remains at $380 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an increased impact of approximately $0.55 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, compared to a prior estimated headwind of $0.38. We expect full year COVID-19-related sales to be approximately $85 million lower than 2021 sales. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. To summarize the key takeaways for the quarter, strong top line growth in proprietary, growth in operating profit, solid adjusted diluted EPS, despite FX and inflationary headwinds and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 14, our performance in Q2 has positioned us well for the second half of the year. We continue to have a strong base business, which is a testament to the foundation we have built over time with the right strategy and execution, leveraging the benefits of a global operating model to deliver the robust book of committed orders and continue to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. Towanda, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Eric Green : Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hi. So could you be a little bit more specific on the COVID headwind? I mean you called out $85 million versus prior. And you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but your prior guide have included some growth with it. And basically, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to make sure I \u00e2\u0080\u0093 trying to back into a more specific number for the organic revenue growth boost to the core business. It looks like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m backing to roughly a 3% increase from your prior guide, just where you use, but just like to work the math out a little bit better if you give us a little bit more guide. Eric Green : Yes, Derik, let me give you a little more color on that. If we think about 2021, our revenues for COVID was approximately $460 million. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in 2022 based on the current visibility and discussions with customers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at about a 20% reduction of that number, which is about $85 million. And if we kind of look at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, this is based on the variability that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in the industry right now. If you think about moving forward for 2023, we do believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by another 30% or maybe up to 50% reduction of the 2022 number. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the glide path we see with COVID-19 demand right now. This is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you are correct, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an implied base business increase. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing with particularly around Biologics and a stronger Pharma and Generics in the second half. So the ex-COVID business, if we would look at the proprietary, it was roughly around 23% growth in proprietary for the second quarter. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s robust and that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing that continue for the balance of the year. Derik de Bruin : Great. Well, thanks for pre-empting my 2023 COVID question, which is going to be the follow-up to that. So thanks for that. And so I get the question, but then that also goes on like have you de-risked the number enough for 2022, right? Is there further downside to that $85 million? Bernard Birkett : Well, based on the information that we have right now, we believe we have de-risked it enough. And based on the facts that we see again, COVID is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always this changing landscape with it, depending on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen this year and probably into 2023. But we have taken a conservative view, I would think around COVID. Derik de Bruin : Got it. And it looks like you called out a 90 basis point margin boost to PP. Was that related to a cancellation fee that might have come in the quarter from COVID projects? Bernard Birkett : Yes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correct. Derik de Bruin : Okay. And any issues in terms of I mean this comes up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is coming up frequently in terms of my incoming questions, in terms of customer inventory stocking, just sort of any signs of anything excess in the supply chain? Eric Green : Yes. No, Derik, we look at the order book today, one area that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on is the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are our lead times. As you can imagine, the last couple of years with the COVID demand, we had to pivot and prioritize in certain parts of our product portfolio. So our focus right now is reduce lead times back to where they should be. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you hear us talk about, we have capacity that is being installed as we speak, but also into 2023, which will give us more capability to support our customers on the increasing demand we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing and particularly around Biologics and in particular on the higher end of high-value products. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the focus we have. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see based on the demand and discussions with customers, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a large restocking concept going on right now with the underlying core business. Derik de Bruin : Great. And just a question from a client. Can you just qualify the cancellation, how big a number would that was? Bernard Birkett : It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approximately $12 million. Derik de Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Eric Green : Thank you, Derik. Operator : Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul Knight : Hi Eric, thanks for the time. Regarding the 23% proprietary growth, obviously, we are seeing Biologics approval strong. But one area that seems to be to get numbers around is biosimilars. How big is biosimilar benefit in the market and to West? Can you have a quantitative or qualitative read on the biosimilar tailwinds? Eric Green : Yes. No, thank you, Paul, for the question. No, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing the benefits of the biosimilar approvals and entry into the marketplaces. Although, I would say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively small in the scheme of the entire Biologics portfolio. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a high-value product adoption. So when you think about the packaging configurations with our biologic customers, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s near identical to what we see with the biosimilars. Paul Knight : And is the trend to single-dose syringe up pretty dramatic or changing in your view? Eric Green : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one area where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing heavily and specifically to give you really a specific areas on NovaPure plungers. And that is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it supports what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying is that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tremendous movement towards prefilled syringes. And in the Biologics space and biosimilar space we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a high adoption of NovaPure. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where our investments are going. We have installations going on in 2022, but also in 2023 to start getting ahead of the curve with our customers. Paul Knight : Okay. And then last, Bernard, the FX guide was $115 million for this year, and now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minus $190 million for the full year. Is that the way we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what you said earlier? Bernard Birkett : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correct. Paul Knight : Okay, thank you. Eric Green : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Larry Solow : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just balancing through a couple of other calls, can you just review, so for the guidance, Eric, so the currency impact is $75 million? And then the net sales impact, I guess, is $25 million, did I get that right? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $85 million less COVID. And then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding back essentially $60 million plus from the base business, is that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 am I capturing that? Eric Green : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correct, Larry. You have that accurate. Larry Solow : Okay. Great. And then on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 then you just mentioned you kind of called out in terms of COVID-related sales, vaccine-related sales dropping this year, like you said, 20%. And then you think there may be another 50% drop in volume demand in 2023. I think I caught that right. And then the offset to that, obviously, hopefully, some offset there would be move to more to the prefilled ranges or less doses per vial. It sounds like a little bit is happening in 2022. Can you just give us a sort of an update on how you see that transforming in 2023 and as we go on? Are you still confident that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a pretty good transformation on the COVID side on the single dose? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, you summarized that well. I just want to add 1 comment though. In 2023, we do think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a range 30% to 50%. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of variability. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to be conservative on our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but your point is valid that there is a shift that is starting to occur with less doses per vial. So that configuration is obviously, in some cases, some customers has moved from about 20-millimeter down to a 13-millimeter stopper. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing right now is more in the vial configuration versus prefilled syringe. We see that into 2023 and beyond. I do want to just state, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less doses per vial, which is a net benefit to West. But the key variable that is very unpredictable right now is the number of patients taking the dose. And the data is widely available in the market, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a little uptake as we speak right now. But yet to be determined as we get through 2022 and also into 2023. Bernard Birkett : Let me add to that, prefilled syringe uptake as Eric just mentioned when answering the other questions is really within our core business within Biologics. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a lot of increased demand move in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 move through 2022 and into 2023, layering in capacity. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for core business. Larry Solow : Right. Right. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. So that big sort of that switch on a macro level, prefilled strings are certainly increasing across the Biologics space and not just specifically the COVID vaccine, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hopeful that will happen. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly some talk of that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure with your customers, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking in general that trend, that multiyear trend, which you talked about for a while. And then on NovaPure itself, can you just give us like an idea, it seems like I know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t break out percentages and penetration, but it seems like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still relatively in the early stages. Can we just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can you just like maybe qualitatively compare like the penetration of NovaPure to, say, FluroTec or Westar one of your more highly penetrated HVPs? Eric Green : I would say what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial in the market right now, the NovaPure is a lower percentage than the other parts of the high-value product portfolio. When you look at the pipeline and/or newly approved drugs that are ramping up in the marketplace, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a higher percentage that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s utilizing the NovaPure, particularly around the plungers. And that lines up very nicely to the investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making this year and next year that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve committed to already to have installation and capacity expanded quite significantly. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we are in that journey. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lower percentage, it has tremendous value proposition to our customers, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we see the pipeline is very attractive, particularly in the biologic space. Larry Solow : Great. And then just lastly, Eric, you spoke a lot about it sounds like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really enthusiastic about sort of the outlook for the self-injectables. And you mentioned, can you just give us sort of a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I know you talked a lot about the CZ and the new 2.25-milliliter insert. Can you just give us a sort of an update on SmartDose? Where we stand with that? And how you see that unfolding over the next few years? Thanks. Eric Green : Larry, this is an area that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on for a number of years. And what we talked about more recently is our customers are looking at ways of taking new molecules, but also current molecules in the market, reformulate and move it from an IV to a subcu delivery mechanism and particularly around life cycle management. And that is actually quite exciting. And hence, when you think about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mentioned on the call in the prepared remarks that we now have 3 combination device approvals with Biologics. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to gain momentum to start moving products into the commercial environment versus still in development. When I look at the development projects we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on with a number of customers, it is now more gravitating towards the larger volumes, existing molecules in the marketplace and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s around life cycle management. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exciting. I believe we are in a good point in time. The more work investments needed to occur, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take some time to get into really large meaningful revenues, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re definitely in the right direction with that part of the portfolio. Larry Solow : Great. Excellent. I appreciate all the color. Thanks. Eric Green : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lin with William Blair. Your line is open. Justin Lin : Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just start off with a simple one. I guess, do you have any plans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just start off with a simple one. I guess, do you have any plans for any further price increases for the rest of the year? Just trying to get a sense of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assumed in your guidance. Bernard Birkett : Well, right now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing with the pricing strategy that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had as we progress through 2022, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done some specific price increases for customers, general price increases. And then we continue to monitor if there are further surcharges that we need to implement as these inflationary costs continue to hit us as we move through the second half of the year. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we review on a monthly basis. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve nothing to announce to say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any specific increase at the moment. Again, but we are tracking it pretty closely and offsetting as much of that cost increase as we can. And as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talking about before, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sometimes a lag as to when we experience the cost increase itself. And then when we can pass it on and again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working through. But again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fluid. Justin Lin : Got it. And can you remind us how we should think about margin cadence for the rest of the year? And I guess, what are the underlying assumptions around raw material costs, freight, and overall supply chain? Eric Green : Yes. So we see that margin continue to step up as we move through the remainder of the year. Again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on what we have been communicating since we gave guidance in February of this year. And we will continue to see that happening as we improve our levels of efficiency and layer in extra capacity. Some of the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having to do right now is to replace the COVID demand that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just called out as decreasing with other products and other demand within our network. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been started doing that as we progress through Q2, that will continue to Q3 and Q4. And the demand is there essentially to fill many of our facilities. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that growth is reflected in the guidance that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embedded. Justin Lin : Got it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful. And just one last one for me. Sort of longer term, that 100 bps of margin improvement each year. I guess, is that predicated on inflation and supply chain pressure easing in 2023? Or can you achieve that without the situation improving? In other words, will the continued uptick in high-value products alone help drive that, obviously, along with sort of the continued increase in efficiency? Bernard Birkett : Our expectation is that, that would be the case. Our target is to continue to expand margins by 100 basis points. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on what we can see today now some black swan event or something happens, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outside of our control, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a different story. But based on what we have in front of us today, the intention is to continue that 100 basis point expansion. Justin Lin : Sounds good. Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Your line is open. Jacob Johnson : Hey, good morning. Just one quick housekeeping question first. On the COVID revenue in 2Q, you talked about 23% growth ex-COVID and Proprietary Products. That seemed to imply that the COVID revenues were maybe $110 million in the quarter. Is that in the ballpark? Bernard Birkett : Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty close. Jacob Johnson : Okay. Thank you. And then, Eric, you mentioned the potential for Pharma and Generic demand to pick up in the second half of the year, and you also mentioned adding some resources there. Can you just talk about the resources you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding there? And were you somewhat capacity constrained for those end markets in the first half of this year? Eric Green : Yes. So the resource is more around the demand bill to deliver on the demand that has been given to us, specifically in Generics and Pharma. And there are discrete customer projects. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling good about the work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ahead of us, but we do need to allocate resources appropriately to deliver those demands that for the second half of this year. That was the intent of that comment, particularly with Pharma and Generics. So if you take the first half of the year compared to the second half, those two units will be growing a lot faster than they were in the first half. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I just want to make sure that was clear. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be occurring from our plants, both in Europe and the U.S. or the United States. Jacob Johnson : Okay. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. And then last question for Bern. Just on R&D expense, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of flattish sequentially. I think if I remember correctly, there are going to be some investments flowing through the R&D line, maybe around the Corning relationship and some other efforts. Just how should we think about R&D expense maybe back half of this year into 2023? Bernard Birkett : Yes, we would expect it to take up in the second half of the year and that there are going to be two drivers around that. One is the level of DAs that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing coming through our pipeline. And then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really on our delivery devices and then also looking at the Corning Glass partnership that we have in place, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be adding additional costs. Again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all embedded in the guidance, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been planned for the year, but that will happen in the second half of the year, more so in Q4 than in Q3. Jacob Johnson : Okay. Perfect. Thanks for taking the question. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Jacob. Operator : Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning, gentlemen. I was hoping to try to shine a little bit more light on the comments around bias toward prefilled syringe NovaPure stoppers that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or excuse me, NovaPure plungers that you mentioned, CZ uptick and workaround syringes there. Like how much of that is related? Like so as clients want prefilled syringe, is that still predominantly glass and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supplying what you traditionally have, but in NovaPure high value? Or is that also driving uptick in CZ resin syringes? Just anything you can add there would be much appreciated. Eric Green : Yes. So Dave, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 CZ is a great application when you start thinking about silicon-free. But from what the preference is, is still glass. Hence, the investments and the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 partnering with Corning. So there are certain molecules, certain applications that CZ is particularly well positioned for, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to capture some of that demand. Now when it comes to NovaPure plungers really the comment is around the glass PFS solution and also more around the biologics and biosimilars than anything else. Dave Windley : Okay. And then, Eric, in your comments around addressing shortening lead times. I want to make sure, I mean, it sounds like the base business is accelerating to, I think it was Larry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridge or maybe Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridge around the $60 million of the base that makes up for some of the weakness. How much of that is, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say, pulling forward activity because space and productive capacity is freed up by the lowering of COVID and to help to shorten lead times for your clients versus kind of underlying steady-state flow of demand. Can you help us to understand the difference there? Eric Green : Yes, Dave, long-term construct, we still believe in the 7% to 9%. So when we started talking about 23% in the quarter for proprietary excluding COVID, that is obviously outsizing that long-term construct. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two elements to that. One is we do believe the freeing up some of the capacity, which is obviously not just dedicated to COVID, it will be able to support our core business and to bring some of those lead times in line. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the entire portfolio, but specific area and probably more around the high-value products. When you think about the market units, Biologics is still really strong. What I mean by that is we think about our order \u00e2\u0080\u0093 confirmed order book, it continues to increase from the end of last year. And one of the major drivers of that is biologics. And when you dig a little bit further, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a combination of recently launched molecules that are having a very strong success in the marketplace. And secondly, is to preparing for the pipeline for newly approved drugs that are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will be approved or have been approved recently. There is always inventory management going on with our customers. But I would say in the last two or three years, we were not in a position to be able to oversupply any one particular customer. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to bring the lead times back in line. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constant work that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on but I want to state that the underlying growth of the business is extremely healthy across all markets and especially in biologics. Dave Windley : Got it. So I guess to rephrase that last point that you just made, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident that customers are not, say, stocking because you basically couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce enough for them to overstock. Maybe to flip the question were they understocked or, I guess, a version of that would be kind of dependent on longer lead times than are comfortable. And so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of catching up and getting them shored back up to what normal should be. It sounds like if \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying. Eric Green : Dave, you are right. Yes, Dave, you are correct. There are in some cases, not across the whole portfolio, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some cases where we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the relationships we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had with our customers is to establish very robust schedules or tight schedules to make sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not creating any issues of availability of material, but there was some of that, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working through those as we speak. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the reasons why we highlighted that some of the capital investments that we made committed to that are rolling in, in this year and also into next year, particularly on NovaPure is to really alleviate to support the growth in the Biologics space, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely needed to get in there to stay ahead of the curve. Dave Windley : Yes. Got it. Bernard Birkett : The way I would frame it is to bring lead times back to where they are pre COVID and then us to be able to maintain those lead times as the business is actually growing rather than having the lead times go back out. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we have to layer in the capacity. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually managing two things at once. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just one. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing this acceleration in growth in some areas of our business plus trying to get customers to stock levels where they feel comfortable if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take a period of time. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an instantaneous thing. Dave Windley : Sure. And Bernard, on your point on layering in the capacity, just to confirm, this change in your \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or does this change in your COVID expectations change the amount of CapEx investment or the pacing of those projects at all relative to bringing on additional capacity. Bernard Birkett : The projects that we have right now, it does not change any of those. And the projects that Eric mentioned about, particularly on the plunger side, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to layer in that capacity. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specifically around growth that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inherent in the market right now and the changes that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no change there. And if we could actually accelerate that onboarding, that would be more beneficial for us if we could do that because the demand is there today. Dave Windley : It seems like a strong sign. Last question for me. In regard to stoppers versus plungers and components that you supply for prefilled syringe. I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve answered in the past that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re relatively economically agnostic to form factor, is that true? Or is there any nuance that we should think about there? Bernard Birkett : No, that holds true. The economics aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that vastly different between the two. Dave Windley : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re answering all my questions. Eric Green : Thank you, Dave. Bernard Birkett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Towanda, and thank you for joining us on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call. An online archive of the broadcast will be available on our website at westpharma.com in the Investors section. That concludes this call. Have a nice day.

I'll begin by covering three main topics, first, examining the drivers of lower than expected Q3 results. Second, examining the impact to Q4, and third, providing color on our current view of market demand and projecting a preliminary sales outlook for 2023. Let's begin with Q3. As expected, we had a few drivers in the quarter that materialized. We had headwinds from FX. We had declining sales in contract manufacturing, and we had a decline in COVID-19-related sales of about $20 million from last year. If we exclude the headwinds from COVID, proprietary organic sales grew over 11%. However, this performance was below our expectations for the quarter. When we provided guidance on the Q2 earnings call, we projected that we would be able to shift resources, formerly dedicated to pandemic-related production to other HVP products that are experiencing increased demand. Specifically, we plan to successfully address this transitioned by accelerating customer orders for NovaPure plungers and fulfilling customer HVP orders originally requested for this year but pushed to 2023 because of longer lead times. These two factors were the underlying drivers to our guidance of strong double-digit base organic net sales in Q3 and Q4. Instead, as the quarter progressed, we underestimated the complexity of the transition and were impacted with a series of setbacks related to capacity constraints and mix shift productivity. Much of our vaccine stoppers were going to fewer customers with fewer SKUs. This enabled high productivity and throughput with our HVP network. When transitioning to NovaPure plungers, we now are addressing demand coming from numerous customers, addressing drugs across numerous diseases and more SKUs. The end result is lower throughput through our existing HVP manufacturing sites. And compounding this situation further, as the quarter progressed, we had a reduction in capacity in our HVP operating network through a combination of equipment downtime and project delays related to the installation of HVP processing equipment. We estimate that the total negative impact to Q3 was $30 million. While we see these issues as temporary and expect full resolution in 2023, they will continue to impact us in Q4. As we look at the capacity constraints, we project that additional HVP processing capacity will come online early next year based on the time line to install and validate the newer technology. Since we are already running at full capacity, we also are unable to address the additional demand coming from long lead time items in Q4. Altogether, while we still expect our base business ex-COVID to grow more than 10% in Q4, we will not be able to offset the expected $80 million reduction in COVID-19 sales. While I'm disappointed that we're lowering our forecast for the rest of 2022, I want to stress that these issues are all supply-related and not demand related. Moving to Slide 6. Our robust order book of committed orders, excluding declining COVID-19-related demand grew 20% year-over-year. Our customers have reiterated that they're looking to West to deliver the critical components and devices to address the growing injectable drug demand. And we have several customers that have notified us of potential upside demand, especially for NovaPure plungers beyond our current order book based on future drug launches. As we look at 2023, we are confident and expect most of the capacity issues will be resolved early in the year. Taking a reasonable view on capacity expansion and customer delivery timing, our preliminary look at 2023 includes the following projections. First, we now assume that COVID-19 sales will decline to a full year 2023 sales of approximately $90 million or a 75% decline from 2022. This is based on current customer forecasts, which we believe assumes a continuation of current trends and COVID booster demand. We expect non-COVID-19 overall base business to grow in the double digits and in excess of our financial construct of 7% to 9%. Base proprietary products are expected to grow in the low teens led by biologics, and we expect CM sales to rebound to growth next year. Our participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and Europe remain strong. Our components by West or our partner, Daikyo, are expecting almost all the biologics and biosimilars approved so far in 2022 and majority of small molecules approved. Adding it all together, our prelimited view is that we will have positive organic sales growth in 2023, despite an anticipated decline of approximately $280 million of COVID-19 sales. We will provide more detailed guidance on our Q4 call in February of next year. Now shifting to Slide 7 and some highlights from the quarter. I want to first thank our team members who continue to focus on our purpose to deliver superior value to customers through our high quality products and solutions to make a meaningful difference to patients' lives. An example of this dedication and resiliency was evident in the recent response to the hurricanes that devastated Puerto Rico and Florida. Despite the personal impacts to our team members, they ensure their plants continued to produce and ship product with minimal impact. Just another great testimony to the strength of our One West team. We continue to make good strides with the opportunity to improve at-home management of diseases. I'm pleased to share that earlier this month, our customer, scPharmaceuticals, received FDA approval for FUROSCIX delivered via on-body infuser, utilizing West SmartDose on-body drug delivery technology. This brings us to four FDA-approved drugs using our SmartDose technology. Our strategic collaboration with Corning is moving along. We anticipate that in Q1 2023, West Ready Pack System with Valor glass vials, a ready to use sterile packaging system for use with NovaPure stoppers will be available to customers. Lastly, our West experts are pleased to be back in-person at recently held PDA Conference and upcoming CPHI worldwide showcasing our leadership with new scientific insights and technical developments across our portfolio of high quality drug delivery and devices. Moving to Slide 8. With the capital spending investments initiated in 2020 for the larger capacity expansion, we continued to drive forward to complete the installation of our 2021 expansions and initiated the next tranche of investment earlier this year. You can see from the pictures how impressed of the ongoing expansions are across our sites. While they do not happen overnight, we are making good progress and expect all these investments will result in several billion units of increased capacity for our HVP components. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let\u2019s review the numbers in more detail. We\u2019ll first look at Q3 2022 revenues and profits, where we saw mid-single digits organic sales growth led by performance in our biologics and generics market units. I will take you through the profit drivers in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2022 guidance. First up, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 18 to 21. We recorded net sales of $686.9 million, representing organic sales growth of 4.3%. Looking at Slide 10, proprietary products sales grew organically by 5.5% in the quarter. High value products, which made up approximately 72% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew mid-single digits and had growth across our biologics and generic market units in Q3. Looking at the performance of market units, the biologics market unit delivered mid-single digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value products. The generics market unit also experienced mid-single digit growth led by sales of Westar components. Our pharma market units are low single digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including NovaPure and Westar components. And contract manufacturing declined 1.2% for the third quarter due to a reduction in sales of components for diagnostic devices. We recorded $268 million in gross profit, $20.2 million or 7% below Q3 of last year and our gross profit margin of 39% was a 180 basis point decline from the same period last year. We saw a 2% increase in adjusted operating profit with $186.4 million record at this quarter compared to $182.8 million in the same period last year. And our adjusted profit margin of 27.1% was a 120 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.03 for Q3, excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit EPS increased by approximately $0.05 and foreign currency negatively impacted our EPS by approximately $0.16 in the quarter. So let\u2019s review the drivers in both the revenue and profit performance. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales decline in the quarter. Volume and mix decreased by approximately $1 million in the quarter net of approximately $20 million decrease in COVID sales. Sales price increases contributed $31.1 million or 4.4 percentage points in the quarter. Foreign currency generated approximately $49.8 million headwind on revenue in the quarter. Looking at margin performance, Slide 12 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 39% for Q3 2022 down from 40.8% in Q3 2021. Proprietary products third quarter gross profit margin of 43.6% was 270 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The decline in proprietary products gross profit margin was caused by a few key factors. Delays in equipment expansion projects, which led to production bottlenecks in certain \u2013 in meeting certain customer demand, customer demand mix shift led to a greater than anticipated impact due to the delays mentioned above, as well as continued inflationary pressures on our plant costs, including raw materials, labor, overheads and transportation. Partially offsetting these headwinds on our margin were sales price increases of a 180 basis points of benefit associated with one-time fees from COVID supply agreements. Contract manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 17.3% was 120 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The increase in margin is largely attributed to price increases in the period and production efficiencies. Now let\u2019s look at our balance sheet and review how we\u2019ve done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $493.2 million for the nine months ended September 2022, an increase of $70 million compared to the same period last year, a 16.5% increase. Our operating cash flow in the nine months period benefited from a working capital performance. Our third quarter 2022 year-to-date capital spending was $189.7 million, $12.8 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1.27 billion at September 30, 2022 increased by $129 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to increase in inventory and reductions in our accounts payable. Our cash balance at September 30 of $729 million was $33.6 million lower than our December 2021 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program, a $43.7 million scheduled payment of debt principle and interest in the third quarter and higher CapEx offset by our operating cash flow in the period. Turning to guidance. Slide 14 provides a high level summary. We are updating our full year 2022 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.83 billion and $2.84 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $2.95 billion to $2.975 billion. There is an estimated fourth quarter headwind $60 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 7% compared to prior guidance of approximately 11%. We expect our full year 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $8.15 to $8.20 compared to a prior range of $9 to $9.15. This revised guidance includes our $0.16 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation during the nine month period. Also we are updating our CapEx guidance to $300 million to $320 million compared to a prior estimate of $380 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS in the fourth quarter was approximately $0.17 headwind. We expect full year COVID-19 related sales to be approximately $85 million lower than 2021 sales, unchanged from our prior guidance. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 15, looking ahead with a sharpened focus, we continue to ensure our growth strategy is bringing value to our customers. Our committed order book remains robust. We continue to capture the benefits of the globalization of our operating network and delivering products in this complex environment. And we continue to drive forward the capital investments across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. Gigi, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight from KeyBanc. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. On the CapEx, it\u2019s now $300 million to $320 million verse $380 million prior is that a signal that you see lower demand? Is it difficulty getting equipment? What\u2019s behind that lower CapEx guidance? Eric Green : Yes. Paul, the lower CapEx guidance is really two things. One is delivery of equipment that\u2019s been delayed in a couple instances and also longer duration of capital build up projects. So we\u2019re seeing that as the impact, not demand. We still need the capital in place to really get caught up to the demand we have in our hands today. Paul Knight : And then you mentioned that the transition from COVID and a few customers to many customers on the plunger side. Are there also some \u2013 we\u2019ve also seen some huge prescriptions out of recent approvals. Are those also surprising you in terms of some of these large prescription trends that are being seen in the market? Eric Green : Yes, Paul. That\u2019s one of the drivers of the healthy order \u2013 committed order book. And that is particularly in the biologics area, we\u2019re seeing out size growth than we anticipated working with our customers. Paul Knight : And last on the plunger side, where will that product be made? Eric Green : Well, we have really five key high-value product plants. The two that have probably the most constraints right now are here in the United States, Kinston and Jersey Shore, and we\u2019re currently working to have that resolved as we speak. Paul Knight : Okay. Thanks. Eric Green : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Larry Solow : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first question, Eric is just \u2013 I know you normally I guess to give some a little preliminary outlook this time of year, but just sort of trying to gauge at your confidence level. Obviously, a little bit of a surprise in terms of looks like customer inventory management is skewing your numbers a little bit and obviously some of the capacity issues. Just curious like your confidence level today to give pretty good guidance for next year, some nice clarity on the revenue side. Is it just you felt like you had to put that out today? Or what kind of gives you that extra confidence sort of in a \u2013 looks like a little bit of a challenging short-term period? Eric Green : Yes. Larry, thank you for the questions. So there\u2019s two things to give you insights on. One is, when you think about inventory management, the only part of our business where there\u2019s fluctuation, I would say is around the COVID-19 vaccines. That has been quite volatile in the last several months. And I would argue that transition to lower volume has been a little bit faster than we anticipated. But when it comes to demand for our other products, particularly base, think about our high-value products, we\u2019re not seeing that inventory management. In fact, just meeting with customers more recently, they are very keen for us to get the installed equipment that\u2019s currently being worked on and validated and up and running to really alleviate some of the bottlenecks that we have today. So we don\u2019t see that large any major movement. We did, however, for clarity, I did say in the script that as we went through 2022, our lead times were extended because of the demand we had on COVID at the time, and therefore, we had orders that we were committing to customers in early 2023. But that wasn\u2019t driven by any inventory management that was driven by our visibility to make the order in a timely fashion. Now, on the second part \u2013 Larry, the second part on giving guidance or giving visibility of sales, I think it\u2019s important to give context with what we just described about installation capacity and the current demand to give visibility what we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s going into 2023 with a high degree of confidence. Larry Solow : Got it. Okay. No, I appreciate that color. And it sounds like you\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s no real change, it sounds like in terms of customer demand and you guys are continuing obviously to build out capacity. It doesn\u2019t feel like \u2013 it just feels like it\u2019s a completely a supply issue. Is that fair to say, no ambiguity? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, that\u2019s fair to say. So as we transition from very long runs of NovaPure stoppers to shorter runs of NovaPure plungers as an example. The equipment that we had intended to be ready to go halfway through this year, which is that\u2019s the delay that we\u2019ve been discussing as caused that mix shift, lack of productivity. And so once that\u2019s up and running, we will be in a good position to fulfil those orders in a timely fashion. Larry Solow : Okay. Great. And just last question perhaps for Bernard. And I know you guys are not ready to a little early on giving full guidance. But in terms of just high level margin outlook, what needs to kind of go right or wrong? What could happen? Could you keep margins flat with overall revenue growing? Although COVID, probably little higher margin revenue coming down from a very high level. Is that \u2013 do you think feasible? Bernard Birkett : Yes. Just on the margin, we\u2019ll provide more color on the margins and earnings on our usual timing on our Q4 call here in February. But there are a number of things that we are monitoring really closely, just like everybody else at the moment. We\u2019re looking to figure out how FX is going to settle in for early 2023, and it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s much too early to make a call on that given the volatility that we\u2019re seeing today. And then secondly, we\u2019re looking at monitoring the inflationary costs right across the spectrum for materials, energy, labor. And again, it\u2019s early to make a call on many of those. And then thirdly, we\u2019re in the process of preparing our price increases for next year, especially in light of that second topic around the inflation rate costs. So that\u2019s evolving. And so then, the fourth point, we\u2019ll examine again, how fast we can get that extra capacity online to generate those demand \u2013 currently demand at HVP sales. So if we can do it sooner than our guidance, there\u2019s upside there to our sales and associated profits with that. I mean, the growth in our base HVP business and HVP margins that will come with that we\u2019re looking to offset that decline around C-19. But again, we have to manage through a lot of these issues at the moment. So, the big positive for us is, is the demand is there and we\u2019re seeing increasing demand around high-value products, particularly around plungers that Eric just mentioned. So as soon as we are on that call, we\u2019ll give you more update. Larry Solow : Yes, fair enough. I appreciate those points. Thanks guys. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes in the line of Derik DeBruin from Bank of America. Derik DeBruin : Hi, good morning. Just like clarify the comment, I mean, you\u2019re talking about seeing positive organic revenue growth next year. I mean, is that \u2013 are we talking 1%? Are we talking to sort of back to this 7% to 9% range? And along those lines, to get to positive that sort of implies that your overall HVP next year \u2013 proprietary products next year have to grow well in excess of that 7% to 9% range. I mean, are those \u2013 can you just sort of provide a little bit more color in terms of how we should think about? I mean, the big range to sort of think about. Eric Green : I\u2019ll start and Bernard, if you want to add. So you\u2019re right, the non-COVID related based business and proprietary is going to have very strong double digits, and it\u2019s be led by biologics. But we\u2019re also seeing strength in both generics and pharma. But the key drivers can be the biologics and the portfolio that\u2019ll support that is mostly around our HVP higher end of the portfolio NovaPure and FluroTec and particularly around plungers. Bernard you want to give more color? Bernard Birkett : Yes. As Eric said that we would expect to see on our base business double digit growth, within that base that\u2019s going to be north of our construct that we put out there. So we\u2019re looking at that base business to be able to offset the C-19 and decline that we potentially could see here. And then, again, looking at the timing of capacity, there could be some upside there also for us. Derik DeBruin : Got it. And back to the margin question, I mean, we sort of look at the \u2013 I guess it\u2019s the question of what\u2019s the worst case scenario that you\u2019re sort of looking at for next year? I mean, is there a situation where you can\u2019t get the capacity online further push out? I guess there\u2019s some fear that the fourth quarter number that you put up, if you sort of annualize that going into next year, it\u2019s pretty ugly in terms of an EPS perspective. I mean, is that a worst case scenario? Just sort of help us sort of understand what the parameters are around the risk to you not being able to sort of bring capacity online? And going back to sort of like the margin profile, sort of thinking about how this all goes through. Eric Green : Yes. On getting that capacity online, that\u2019s actually in progress. And as we mentioned in the comments at the start, we would expect to see that early 2023. So, we are reasonably confident around having that uplift. Derik DeBruin : Got it. And just to sort of reiterate rhetoric point, you\u2019re not seeing any inventory-related issues, but can you give us sort of like any indication of what some of the drugs you\u2019re like scaling on for \u2013 are you involved in obesity drugs that are coming up and coming online. Just to sort of give us a sense of where some of the demand is coming from? Eric Green : Yes, we\u2019ll give you a couple areas. We don\u2019t give specific customers or drug molecules, particularly on the elastomers unless our customers will articulate that publicly. But they do tend to be \u2013 first of all, we're seeing, as I indicated a little bit earlier, success is some very drug launches, particularly in biologics that were over the last few years, and that's quite positive. We are obviously in discussions around the obesity drug launches that are being looked at in the marketplaces, diabetes, obviously, those are the key large volume areas that where West is part of those conversations. But going any further into specific drug molecule or a specific customer that would be \u2013 we just simply don't go down that path. Derik DeBruin : Thank you. I will get into queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Dave Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Bernard, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think I kind of missed it, but 180 basis points in reference to COVID supply agreement and we had in our notes that there was some carryover take-or-pay related revenue or payment that you were expecting had it in 2Q expected some again in 3Q. Was that the same thing? And could you elaborate, quantify that for us, please? Bernard Birkett : Yes, it was the same. It was relating to the same customer. It had to get split over two quarters. So that's what we relate to and then there were some other smaller bits that were not really material, but it was primarily related to one customer. Dave Windley : And the 180 basis points, I missed the detail that was a benefit to gross margin. What was the 180? Bernard Birkett : Yes, it was to gross margin. Dave Windley : Yes. Okay. In thinking about your fourth quarter guidance and kind of dovetailing on both Derik and I think Larry's questions on margin, it looks like the fourth quarter gross margin proprietary product is probably down in the mid-30s, maybe lower. And so I wondered if you could help us to understand, is that just basically unutilized or underutilized capacity because so much COVID is coming out and before you're really able to ramp high value for these other products, it sounds like plungers mostly? Or what other factors should we be thinking about relative to fourth quarter margin? And how much that does or does not set the baseline for thinking about 2023? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So in the fourth quarter, as a carryover from the issues that we experienced in Q3 with the delays and after getting equipment in place and then the impact that's having on our throughput and then also has been able to work through this mix shift change at the same time. When we layer in the capacity in early 2023 and that will resolve a lot of that problem. So it's really down to having that increased capacity and throughput. So we don't believe it will reoccur. Dave Windley : So pardon the follow-up. So I know you probably don't want to get into too much operational minutia, but adding capacity doesn't sound like something that levers margin. That sounds like something that adds more cost. It seems like you would want more volume on the same capacity to get the margin backup so maybe you could help us to understand kind of how that flows and how that works? Bernard Birkett : So it's not \u2013 it's actually going to enable us to clear more products through or end of lines with the capacity will actually help our HVP sales and help distribute fixed cost and improve our absorption. So it's not that we're going to layer in more cost and it's going to be detrimental. It actually gives us the ability to sell more high value products and get it through our plants actually quicker. So we can realize those revenues faster. Dave Windley : And zooming out a little bit on high value, I think, we probably been slow to absorb it in the market, but your COVID product mix, you'd consistently highlighted that FluroTec and NovaPure were popular in that market or to those customers. It sounds like NovaPure is \u2013 you're still calling out NovaPure and NovaPure plungers, I'd ask if we should be thinking that those plungers are purely NovaPure or if it's more of a mix. But the general question here is, how should we think about the mix within the high value products as you move out of COVID heavy period and into this period where as you described, the customers and the SKUs are much broader? Eric Green : Yes. So when you look at the portfolio, it's going to be mostly \u2013 you are right. So when you look at COVID-19, mostly it was NovaPure and FluroTec stoppers and high \u2013 nice margin associated to that. And but you think about the plungers demand that we currently have. It is a mix but mostly is NovaPure. And that is when you think about the investments we're making right now, it is around that NovaPure corridor. And so some are laminates from not laminated, but it's a NovaPure platform that we're working with. Dave Windley : Okay. And then a final question for me. You mentioned the Valor \u2013 the packaged Valor go-to-market product or system is available in January, which strikes me is pretty early, pretty quick so good news there. But I guess I wanted to ask, what does availability mean? Does that start some kind of early-stage development sampling and testing? Or what does that availability really mean? Eric Green : Yes. That's early stage. We think about one of the benefits we have with our ReadyPack portfolio is that it has been known to be a great accelerator of seed in the market, so particularly around the smaller pharma and smaller biotechs. They are looking for an off-the-shelf solution and we are able to provide with all the technical data to support it, so this is feet in the pipeline, large and small customers and it\u2019s really around the early drug development phase. Just want to use us as an example as when we launched NovaPure in 2016 time frame, our avenue was through the ReadyPack, same channel, same approach, seed in the market. [Technical Difficulty] And today, you can sense from this call, we spent a lot of time talking about NovaPure is becoming somewhat now the new standard of biologics. That's the intent with the collaboration between Corning and West and I\u2019m very pleased on both technical teams are really continuously driving that differentiation of what this means in the market for our customers and ultimately the patient. So it's early stages, but we will keep you updated, but I'm excited about the launch in the first part of the year. Dave Windley : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson from Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe a follow-up on Derik's question around kind of 2023 revenue growth, obviously, a little bit of a change this morning in your 2022 kind of revenue dollar expectations versus where you were three months ago, but that seems to be due to some kind of one-off issues. Is there any change to kind of your 2023 expectations today versus where you were a couple of months ago because obviously as we think about 2023, you will have a little bit of an easier comp given kind of the revenue decline in the 4Q. So I'm just kind of curious how much of that strong growth next year is something that's easy comp versus kind of strong demand I don't know if that's possible to answer, but I'll try asking. Eric Green : No, thanks, Jacob. So I think there's a couple of levers to look at. One is, this puts COVID to the side after saying that I think in the last call, we talked about roughly around 50% reduction in 2023 over 2022. Right now, what we're saying it's about a 75% reduction. So that equates to that $280 million we discussed. On the growth, the underlying growth of the business, we're relatively the same as what we were looking at about mid-last year, but maybe a little bit stronger than the biologics than we anticipated. So net-net, about the same, I would say. If we are able to get capacity online sooner, I can assure you that we're laser-focused on really those two sites right now to get this equipment validated with our customers so we can produce product. But we're just conservatively saying right now, we're looking at a benefit of early 2023. But if we can get on in the next several weeks, we will do so because we do have demand and we have customers asking us to produce as much as you can in the short-term. I think one last thing about the last change, I would say, is a small piece, but see them return to growth. We didn't really talk as much about that in the last quarter, but we're seeing that starting to come back to that mid-single-digit type corridor, if not a little bit better for next year. So that's where we stand with the changes from three months ago. Jacob Johnson : Okay. Super helpful, Eric. And then just I know COVID is going to be a smaller piece of revenue next year, but on kind of the transition that single dose vials or prefilled syringes. I think Pfizer highlighted some of this in an announcement last week. Just curious your latest thoughts on the shift towards single dose vials in terms of kind of timing and the mix of COVID doses that could be single dose maybe as we look into next year or what's contemplated in your guidance? Eric Green : Yes, just a quick comment. I mean, if you talk about a lot of variability that\u2019s one area but there is lot of variability and COVID in the last six months. So yes, there is a \u2013 if you think about there's a transition, trying to get lower doses per vial and a single dose use obviously, prefilled syringe. That shift is still occurring but it\u2019s not as fast as we anticipated. Jacob Johnson : Okay, got it. Thanks for taking questions. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Gigi. Thank you for joining us on today's conference call. An online archive of the broadcast will be available for 30 days [Technical Difficulty] in the Investors section. That concludes today\u2019s call. Have a nice day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release.  I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.  We will start on Slide 5. For over 100 years, the West name has come to mean so much to so many people. We have grown and expanded from manufacturing primary containment components to designing and manufacturing delivery systems. This remains the same today. As a global market leader who continues to define the evolution of our industry, our 10,000-plus team members are motivated by improving patient lives. The past few years have been a reminder that the world doesn't stand still and the needs of the health care industry are evolving and growing in complexity with shifting treatment options from the hospital to home setting. We remain committed to the pursuit of scientific innovation and partnerships to address the changing needs of today and into the future.  Moving to Slide 6. Looking back at the year, I'm pleased to report that West delivered overall organic sales growth of approximately 8%. This growth was generated despite a rapidly shifting pandemic landscape. We started 2022 expecting COVID-19 volume growth, but instead decline in orders and demand from our customers actually resulted in a 15% decline in pandemic-related sales. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate that our base organic sales growth was low double digit, with mid-teens growth in proprietary products, and driving this base growth is demand for our high-value product offerings for both legacy as well as recently launched drugs, and we ended the year with a return to growth in Q4 in contract manufacturing. This performance is a result of the dedication and relentless focus of our team members across the globe. We are connected by a strong responsibility and shared values that continue to help us succeed each day. I want to acknowledge these efforts and say thank you.  Looking ahead, we remain well positioned with the right growth strategy around execute, innovate and grow. Our solid order book of committed orders reinforces the criticality of West's components and devices to address our customers' growing injectable drug demand, and we continue to deploy capital investments to support the increase in demand driven by the attractive end markets.  Turning to Slide 7. In addition to our financial momentum, there were several other notable accomplishments in 2022. We shipped close to 47 billion components touching billions of patient lives. As scientific and technical leaders in the industry, our customers expect us to help solve their problems. We continue to broaden insights with our expertise through our webinars, published articles and technical presentations. We partnered with Corning to build a next-generation leading elastomer-glass system. We launched Daikyo CZ 2.25 ml insert needle syringe to support the biologics market and secured 3 additional FDA-approved drugs using our SmartDose technology as we continue to bring additional value to our customers.  Lastly, we donated $2.75 million, but more importantly, our team members continue to volunteer their time to help our local communities with the greatest needs. Our heartfelt thoughts are with all those impacted by the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, where we have provided aid through UNICEF.  Shifting to Slide 8. We continue to factor environmental considerations into every aspect of our business. Over the past 5 years, we have made tremendous strides across the 6 priority areas and newly defined performance indicators. I'm pleased that we're on target with 90% of our operational waste not being sent to landfills. Our pursuit of renewable energy alternatives has aided in a positive impact in the emission reduction. These efforts have been recognized with numerous ESG accolades in 2022. We look forward to sharing more detail in our corporate responsibility report to be published in the spring. Turning to Slide 9. We continue to address the growing market needs with today's complex and sensitive molecules. At the recent Pharma Pack meeting, we introduced several new products for large volume delivery and complete vial containment solutions. One available product is our West Ready Pack with Corning's Valor ready-to-use vials. This will be the first of many products from our Corning partnership. The combination of these products eliminates the risk of delamination and reduces glass particulate in bulk filling lines. It is drug delivery innovations like this that ensures best-in-class performance with a value proposition to meet the increased regulatory expectations with a complete vial containment solution.  Moving to Slide 10. We are introducing full year 2023 financial guidance. This guidance is based on demand trends as well as our current capacity levels. It's also reinforced by our strong West and Daikyo participation rate in drug approvals, especially in biologics and biosimilars. We expect full year overall organic sales growth of approximately 3% to 4%, which includes a $303 million year-over-year decline in pandemic-related sales. Excluding this impact, we expect mid-teens overall base organic sales growth with proprietary products growth in the high teens and high single-digit growth in contract manufacturing.  2023 will represent a transition year for our margin profile as we see a headwind from COVID-19 HVPs. That said, our expected margins for this year are significantly above pre-pandemic 2019 levels. This underscores the strength of our financial construct with annual margin expansion of 100 basis points or more per year. In 2019, we posted operating margin of 16.1%. In 2023, we expect operating margin of 23% to 24%, which would represent an increase of approximately 800 basis points over a 4-year period.  Also, today we announced that the Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase plan as our prior plan was completed last year. This program is authorized for up to $1 billion of share repurchase. We note that this new program does not have a specified end date. As comparison, in 2022, our 12-month program was completed at $203 million of buybacks. And in 2021, our 12-month program was completed at $137 million of buybacks. This new $1 billion program will provide for a continuation of our share count-neutral strategy, which is assumed in our 2023 full year financial guidance. We believe this program will also provide flexibility for incremental share repurchases depending on various factors such as economic and market conditions. Turning to Slide 11. As you can see from our guidance, we seek continued base momentum in 2023, and we're planning for a further additional growth as our customers are preparing for expanded success of their current biologics portfolio and drug launches. As such, we continue to drive forward to complete the installation of our capital expansion plans for additional HVP capacity. The picture shows the progression of our ongoing efforts. On my recent visit to Kinston, it was impressive to see the additional space added to accommodate the installation of new manufacturing equipment to address the growth of HVPs and plungers. Together with other site expansions, this will support future demand across our global manufacturing network.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. We will first look at Q4 2022 revenues and profits, where we saw low single-digit organic sales growth and a decline in operating profit and diluted EPS. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will review our 2023 guidance.  First off, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 12 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 20 to 23. We recorded net sales of $708.7 million in the quarter, representing organic sales growth of 2.6%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $55 million in the quarter, an approximate $69 million reduction compared to the prior year. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.  Looking at Slide 13. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 1.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 72% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter were flat compared to the prior year due to the reduction in COVID-related net revenues. Looking at the performance of the market units, the generics market unit delivered double-digit growth led by ambition components and admin systems, while the pharma market unit experienced high single-digit growth led by NovaPure and Westar components. And the biologics market unit saw a mid-single-digit decline due to a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine.  Our Contract Manufacturing segment experienced net sales growth of 7% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales of health care-related medical devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 22.4% was a 350 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 13.2% for Q4. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.06 in Q4, EPS declined by approximately 13.6%.  Now let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance.  On Slide 14, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $28.1 million or 3.8 percentage points of growth. Offsetting price was a foreign currency headwind of approximately $41.3 million and a negative mix impact of $8.9 million, primarily due to a reduction in COVID-19-related net demand. Looking at margin performance, Slide 15 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q4 2022, down from 41.1% in Q4 2021. Proprietary Products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 41.6% was 470 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021. The key drivers for the decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were unfavorable mix from a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine and continued inflationary pressures on our plant costs, including raw materials, labor and overheads. The headwinds were partially offset by sales price increases. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 15.4% was 110 basis points below the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to mix of products sold.  Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash.  On Slide 16, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $724 million for the year, an increase of $140 million compared to the same period last year, a 24% increase. Operating cash flow in the period benefited from our working capital improvement. In 2022, we spent over $284 million on capital expenditures, a 12% increase over 2021. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity within our existing facilities in the U.S., Germany, Ireland and Singapore. Working capital of approximately $1.4 billion increased by $252.6 million from 2021, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales, higher inventory levels and an increase in our cash position. Our cash balance at December 31 of $894.3 million was $131.7 million higher than our December 2021 balance. The increase in cash is primarily due to our operating results in the period, offset by our share repurchase program and higher CapEx. Turning to guidance. Slide 10 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2023 net sales guidance will be in a range of $2.935 billion and $2.96 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $30 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.25 to $7.40. Also, our CapEx guidance is $350 million for the year.  There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.11 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. We expect full year COVID-19 related net sales to be approximately $85 million compared to $388 million in 2022. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.  I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 17, the solid financial performance shared today continues to reaffirm that our growth strategy is working. We have a durable base business proven by our market-led approach which is delivering unique value to our customers. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products in this complex environment with a focus on service and quality. And we're continuing to progress capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. We realize that our products in pursuit of scientific innovations are critical to health care across the globe which is why we're so committed to support patient health today and well into the future.  Shannon, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Lawrence Solow : Congrats on a good quarter, better than obviously we expected. Eric, maybe could you just discuss sort of the long-range outlook. HVP, I know you mentioned 72% of volume in the -- revenue in the quarter. But could you speak to it more on a volume basis and particularly some of the faster growing and higher margin, NovaPure and as you kind of send up the HVP curve, if you will, I mean, the opportunities over the next several years? Eric Green : Yes. Thanks, Larry. No, you're right. So if you think about HVP right now, the amount of units produced from our manufacturing sites is roughly around 23% of the total volume. But as you rightly pointed out, it was about 72% of our sales in the last quarter. And the higher growth part of that high-value product spectrum of the portfolio is coming from our FluroTec all the way up to NovaPure. So NovaPure is becoming more meaningful. Obviously, it was a major element of the COVID-19 response. But with the number of biologic launches, the NovaPure is becoming a very attractive solution for our customers. So I would say it's early. The investments that we're making, particularly in our HVP plants of Kinston, Jersey Shore are around NovaPure plungers and other types of plungers to address future launches. So that's where the growth is really out portion is coming from the higher end of HVP as we speak. Lawrence Solow : Okay. And how about just -- yes, go ahead, I'm sorry. Bernard Birkett : If you look at the CapEx guidance as well that approximately 70% of that CapEx number is really to support growth initiatives and productivity improvements. And much of that is around high-value products. So that ties in with the outlook that we would see for the next number of years putting that capacity in place. Lawrence Solow : And what about just generally in the industry, I know the trends have been biologics are obviously growing faster than overall drugs. Has that trend like accelerated over the last few years? Or what's the outlook there on a general macro level? Eric Green : Yes. We believe the biologics and biosimilar space is going to be the fastest-growing area for new drug launches. If you think about the last year, though, however, it was interesting to see the number of ANDAs and also small molecules approved into the market. And fortunately, we have a strong position in those areas also. But I think if you kind of fast forward, you'll still see biologics and biosimilars be the fastest growth area in our space. Lawrence Solow : Got it. And then just lastly, can you just give us sort of a -- just a brief update on the call, not sure if you had talked a little bit about Corning at all, but just sort of where we stand there? I know I think last year, you had even called out how much you're spending on R&D. I'm sure it's a pretty incremental piece this year as well. But I don't know what you could speak to on the R&D side and the cost, but maybe just sort of where we stand qualitatively, the revenue outlook and how big this could be over the next few years? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, it's a really strong partnership, and we're really pleased that earlier this month, we were able to announce our first product launch of combining our West NovaPure stopper in Corning's Valor vials, which -- what we label as our Ready Pack solution. And just to remind everyone that this is kind of a seeder or a seed program that we use in the development of new molecules. So this has been very successful for us in the past. We're leveraging this channel to introduce this combination going forward. It's a great testament of the focus between the 2 firms on really bringing the product together as a complete solution. And so while this is early, we saw more work to do. We have a number of launches that we have scheduled, whether it's in 2023, 2024. Ultimately, where we want to get to is a complete solution with the 1 drug master vial. So it's a complete fully characterized system. And so that we'll continue required investments. And so if you look at our R&D spend in 2023, it will be slightly up, and a good portion of that incremental piece will be around the West-Corning partnership. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Matthew Larew : I just wanted to ask just you referenced sort of the committed order book. And I'm curious maybe if you compare the composition of that order book today versus pre-COVID, obviously, on the non-COVID part? Maybe just in terms of what NovaPure and FluroTec demand look like? I guess the question is, out of the potential FluroTec customers who you start engaging with, what does the conversion look like -- excuse me, on the NovaPure side, what does the conversion look like, in terms of folks who ultimately end up choosing to go with NovaPure perhaps versus a few years ago? Eric Green : Yes. Thank you for the question. So when I look at the order book versus pre-pandemic and then strip out the COVID piece, overall, it's a net increase where we were at that point in time. When you look at the composite of the growth of that order book, it is really driven by our high-value products, and particularly the higher end HVPs, we're seeing a healthy growth in plungers, not just in the NovaPure sector, but in the other categories of HVP. But -- so from an order -- committed order book perspective, that's the kind of the characteristics we're seeing right now.  In regards to the adoption rate, it's actually quite high. So our participation rate, particularly in the biologics and biosimilars is very, very strong. And what we are doing is we're seeding with the NovaPure portfolio. And once that is locked in, in the development phase as they go through into commercialization, that's the end result. Better outcomes for our customers, obviously, better compatibility with the drug molecule. So we're very excited to see the continuation of that adoption of NovaPure and that's hence the reason why we're putting these investments in place, and we're seeing more of a transition from vials to prefilled syringes which will require our plungers. So that's where we are, but it's a very, very healthy growth profile of the higher end of HVPs. Matthew Larew : And then just maybe a cleanup one on the equipment issues you referenced on the third quarter call. How does that end up impacting fourth quarter results relative to expectations of where do things stand now halfway into the first quarter of '23? Eric Green : Yes. So those issues are resolved. The team did a really great job to resolve the issues and get our manufacturing facilities back up online. Fully validated, characterized and be able to support commercial production. That was done in, I'd say, mid part of Q4, a little bit later in that part of the quarter. So we're full out right now in Q1. And I'm excited that we have that at this point to allow us to get some of the backlog caught up in the early parts of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe kind of following up on that last question. Just Bernard, as we think about how the year plays out, anything you'd highlight in terms of seasonality or kind of margin progression, revenue progression throughout the year? And maybe along those same lines, can you just remind us when you have the toughest comps from COVID that you'll be lapping from 2022? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So I think from a cadence perspective, going back to what we would have seen kind of pre-COVID where first quarter is usually a little bit lighter, picks up a bit in the second quarter and then levels out in Q3 and Q4. And from a comp perspective, I think a lot of the COVID revenues we would have had would have been in the first half of 2022. So that's where, I won't say challenges, but that's where the biggest comps are going to be from that perspective, and then some in Q3 and then obviously lighter in Q4. Jacob Johnson : Got it. And then on contract manufacturing, nice to see a return to growth there, uptick in revenue in the quarter. I think gross margin was down sequentially. Can you just hit on what drove both? And maybe related, you're pointing to, I think, pretty robust growth in 2023. Were there some investments you're making for this year and kind of again along the same lines, what's driving the growth in that business in 2023? Bernard Birkett : Yes. I think as you'll remember, when we were talking through 2022, a lot of the challenges we face within contract manufacturing is really around 1, 2 -- 1 customer mainly and a shift in their business. And so as that kind of have tailed off towards the back end of the year, it allows us to be able to return to growth. And then we actually saw demand increase from our existing customer base probably a little bit ahead of where we would have anticipated going into the fourth quarter. So that was again positive to see. And what we would expect as we move into 2023 that we will be seeing mid-single-digit growth for our contract manufacturing on our existing business and then layering in new business at the same time. So we continue to make some investments in that area. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Paul Knight : The question is, I touched on it, I guess, is COVID probably starts flow then they manufacture more product Q2, Q3, right? And then less in Q4. That's the question one. And then the other would be regarding this prefilled syringe market is that really what you're seeing as biggest opportunity right now? Eric Green : Yes. Paul, that's a good question. So the first part is that when we think about the COVID, it's -- we're looking about right now, approximately $85 million for 2023 is relatively kind of evenly spread. We can't get any more granular than that at this point. But as you know, we were much higher than that last year. So we do have the capabilities to manufacture accordingly.  In regards to the prefilled syringe, when you think about our investments, particularly in the last couple of years and working with some of the launches in anticipation around plungers, which obviously supports the prefilled syringe space is actually -- we're anticipating higher growth in that area. And that is -- equipment is coming online as we speak. I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks about Kinston, a lot of the additional equipment in there is really geared around plungers. And so I'm excited to build support that part of the market as we see the prefilled syringe market continue to expand with high growth. So we're going to play in that, and we're prepared for it, and that's where investments are really focused on today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : So can you talk a little bit about sort of like pricing? You got about 4% in 4Q. How should we think about that in '23? Are you -- I know you were debating taking some higher pricing. You're looking at your pricing dynamics as things are going forward. And I guess, have you done that? And are you -- have you seen any pushback from your customers? Eric Green : Yes. Thanks for the question. So you're right. We have implemented in the fourth quarter of 2022, obviously, discussions with our customers about the 2023 calendar year. Our net price increase will go up in 2023, and that is obviously for all the right reasons, particularly with some of the inflationary challenges and so forth that I think all industries are being faced with. So I think the team responded appropriately. I believe we took a very -- very well-balanced approach. We do have certain customers on contracts, so we did have some limitations. However, overall, with the new pricing team and strategy we put in place a couple of years ago, we're starting to see that pay off. So that will be rolling out as we speak and already this quarter and will be rolling throughout 2023. But Bernard, do you want to provide more color on that? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So our -- I think in the fourth quarter, we said we did about 3.8% of pricing. We're targeting 5% to 6% on price as we move through 2023. So it is a bit of a step up. And part of that is to take into account the inflationary cost pressures that we're also seeing. But as Eric said, you can see the trajectory and our price increases over the last number of years and how we're approaching that. That's also been on the increase. Derik De Bruin : Great. Just a little bit of an accounting question. What was the tailwind from stock-based comp in '22? And your initial tax rates are never what you end up being with for the full year. So is it comparable to think -- is it reasonable to think you get a comparable benefit in '23? Bernard Birkett : We guide without it because it's very hard for us to estimate it. If you look at -- last year, it was about $0.22, I believe. So it's -- we guide without it for a reason because it is so hard for us to predict that's kind of outside of our control. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And if I can squeeze one more in, if you don't mind. How should we think about the economics on the prefilled syringes? I mean, obviously, there's a lot of new drugs coming out for metabolic disease, for obesity. And how should we think about your potential profitability or the revenues associated with one of those units? And just give us some way to sort of like ballpark what your -- I mean what your revenue contribution could be on something like that? Eric Green : Yes. So if you think about the prefilled syringe area and the plungers, we are -- it depends on if it's NovaPure, it's pretty comparable to -- we talk about the $0.88 to over $1 a unit. But if it's not the NovaPure, other types of HVPs you have a very large range between, let's call it, $0.40 per unit. So you can see the range that we're operating in. From a margin perspective, again, if it is HVP that could range anywhere between 55% to 80%.  So I'm giving you a very broad range because not all molecules have the same requirements. But what's good around our investment thesis in our facilities, particularly on plungers is that the equipment and the processes are somewhat fungible. So we can leverage the existing assets we're putting into the current drug launches, but also the anticipated areas of potential growth. So we're positioned well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Sourbeer with UBS. John Sourbeer : I guess maybe digging in a little bit more on the new capacity coming online in the CapEx. Any color just on pacing there for the year? And then just a follow-up on the equipment and the delays in 3Q. I think that was around the $30 million a month headwind. Can we assume now that this is up, that's contributing around $30 million a month as well? Bernard Birkett : Yes. The impact in Q3 was about $30 million. And that may vary depending on volume mix as we go through each quarter. So it's hard to say, it's $30 million each quarter. It would be difficult to commit to that at this point. But in saying that all of those problems that we had in Q3 have been resolved, as Eric kind of talked about earlier, and much of that happened as we progressed through Q4.  And on the pacing of layering in new CapEx, that will happen as we move through 2023. So it's not all at once. We'll see some of it as we get into the back end of the second quarter particularly in Kinston, where we are getting new parts of our facility up and running with the equipment that we've installed there. And then as we progress through the year, there will be equipment layered in in the other HVP sites. John Sourbeer : Got it. I appreciate it. And then I guess just maybe on COVID, it looks like you lowered the guidance there slightly. I guess just any thoughts on just where endemic levels go from here? How much more further drop do you think that you see coming down from COVID beyond 2023? Bernard Birkett : It's hard to estimate that. Like we've tried to -- well, we've given our best estimate based on the information that we have today. If we thought it was going to drop any further, and we would have included that in the guidance. But based on what we see today, that's where we think it's going to play out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : I hope you can hear me. I wanted to -- I've got a couple of follow-ups, but I wanted to start with just asking if you would level set where the market units are with kind of generics having a strong end of the year and biologics down, those are kind of opposite directions than is normal. What's the kind of relative sizing of your 4 segments of the business so we have a base to work off of? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So if you look at biologics as we go into 2023, the biggest drop -- or the biggest impact of COVID revenues being reducing is within the biologics segment. So we do see a reduction there. But if you back that out, we're actually seeing very strong double-digit growth within the biologics segment for our core business. And then as we progress through '23 on generics, again, we would be looking to see high single-digit, early double-digit growth, pharma, high single digits and then contract manufacturing, as we said earlier, mid-single-digit growth. David Windley : Okay. And Bernard, so to apply those, so is it like I think biologics was 40% to 45%. I'm just looking for should I think about with the kind of COVID correction that it's closer to the 40%? I'm just looking for kind of the percentages to apply those growth percentages to. Bernard Birkett : Yes. It's -- biologics was mid-40s. It's going to come back a slight bit. So you're probably 40% to 45%. And then -- pharma and contract was about 17% or 18%. David Windley : That's fine. I can follow up offline. On the installation of the equipment and Eric, we talked about in Kinston, the washing equipment in that process, I guess I was under the impression that that was specifically NovaPure and maybe even more specifically NovaPure plunger equipment, but Bernard's answered the last question that it kind of varies that that $30 million a month will vary based on volume and mix, maybe I misunderstood what -- how fungible that equipment is across your product lines? So perhaps you could further elaborate on that, please? Eric Green : Yes. No, absolutely. So specifically the equipment that we've discussed about Q3, that was ongoing operations, not specifically just NovaPure. So you have washers that wash -- pharmaceutical washing capability that supports really the high-value product portfolio. The vision that you -- the washing equipment that you were able to see that is for NovaPure. So some of the equipment is not fungible, but the core elements of the equipment is. But the growth that we're having, based off of that equipment you looked at was really around the heavy part about the NovaPure. There's some mix effect to it. And in the future investments we're making that you saw in Kinston, that is -- that's, again, it's a wide range of high-value products. FluroTec all the way up to NovaPure. David Windley : Okay. So where I wanted to go with that, and I'll make this my last one, is you're losing the year-over-year COVID $300-ish million. Management has made the point that that has been very high gross margin, high incremental margin revenue. And so that creates, I think, contributes to this transition year on margin, Eric, that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, it seems like as you've put some of this equipment in place that was the hold up in 3Q, again, your last answer helps me to understand that better. But the revenue potential that that equipment unlocks is in the neighborhood of the revenue that you're losing from COVID. I guess I now understand that maybe the margin on that revenue that's coming in is perhaps not quite as rich as COVID, you could confirm that for me. But just thinking about that and any other factors that we should be keeping in mind that influence that margin transition that are not as rich as the COVID revenue that is coming off? Bernard Birkett : Yes. Dave, I'll take that. And just going back to your last question on the split, just to clear that up. So the -- as a percentage of proprietary sales, biologics is like mid-40s, generics, mid-20s and then pharma in a low 30% range, and that will get you to the split.  With regard to your question on margin, it's not as simple as one product coming out and another product going in. So we're looking at it where there's a mix impact, obviously, with the COVID revenues falling off and they have been higher-margin products. And we've also got the impact of inflation on our cost base. So you've got those 2 headwinds. And then as we alluded to, we talked about earlier is the increase in price that we're seeing is above what we would normally see in our business. So that helps offset some of this margin pressure.  And then we have a very specific cost initiatives within our business, both from an operations manufacturing perspective and then on SG&A and R&D, really looking at cost control and cost management. That is delivering a number of efficiencies for us. So it helps us to overcome some of the margin challenges, but not all of them. And then that goes back to the point earlier, we're not actually -- margin is not stepping back to pre-COVID levels. We're maintaining or holding on to a lot of the improvements that we made or the gains that we made. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Justin Bowers : Just piggybacking on Dave's question. Can you help us understand and maybe it's a range of sort of what the margin profile is on the C-19 business? And then with respect to the new capacity that's coming online in 2023, can you help us understand how that phases in? Is it ratable? Or is it more second half loaded? Any color there would be helpful. Bernard Birkett : So the margin on the COVID products would have been at the higher end of our margin range because a lot of that was NovaPure. So you could have been looking at range of 60% to 70% plus. And then on the CapEx piece on that being layered in, it's -- a lot of it has been layered in and commissioned as we speak. But to see the impact of it will be more so in the back half of the year when it's fully operational and we're able to put a lot of volume through. Justin Bowers : Understood. And then just a quick one on China. Maybe a status update on the 2 plants over there? And any thoughts on how that impacts the progression of the year? Eric Green : Yes. In China, the -- our business impact for West overall is quite low. A lot of the activity that we're manufacturing we do in China is for China. And so we have a really strong team there in our facility in Qingpu that continues to capture more share within the market. But our reliance on that -- on our team there to export is very low. And again, overall value or revenues and profits to the corporation is very small. So that's our impact in China. Our supply chain, if you think about procuring materials, is not heavily dependent on that part of the world. The team has done a really good job. Many of our products are co-located to our manufacturing sites. So that's how we've set up our procurement and supply chain of raw materials. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Shannon, and thank all of you for joining us on today's conference call.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Great. Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5. On April 14, West turned 100 years old. This is a major milestone that we're very proud of. Over the course of our 100-year history, the West name has come to mean so much to so many people. I would like to recognize our founder, Herman O. West, and the past generations of leadership that have built West to who we are today. In addition, I want to especially thank our 10,000-plus team members who are motivated by our purpose of improving patient lives and making a difference in the communities in which we work and live. Moving to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that we delivered a solid first quarter. This was driven by overall organic sales growth of over 2%. Excluding COVID-19, our base organic sales grew high teens. Our end markets remain stable even in this uncertain macroeconomic environment. As expected, we saw a drop in COVID-19-related sales compared to last year. That said, our Biologics market unit, excluding COVID, again grew double digits, and we expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year. With a focus on reprioritization of longer lead time components, our Generics and Pharma market units delivered an especially strong quarter of double-digit organic growth. In addition, our Contract Manufacturing had solid growth while delivering components for injection-related devices. This overall performance is a result of our team members across the globe as they remain focused on our strategic initiative of execute, innovate and grow. The resiliency of the business continues to be a reflection of our team members, and I want to acknowledge these efforts and say thank you. Turning to Slide 7. In addition to our financial performance, there were several other significant accomplishments in our quarter. I would like to highlight a few. In February, we opened our new R&D lab in Radnor, Pennsylvania. This investment supports our capability enhancements while meeting the growing needs of customers in the changing regulatory environment across the globe. The lab supplied research will include containment and systems for advanced therapies and biomaterials, along with advanced design and engineering for drug delivery. In addition, the lab will also test and develop elastomer glass systems, and the work done here will support our future R&D ambitions for new containment and packaging solutions. Our product innovations have been recognized with several notable awards, including the Best Technologies Award at Interphex for our West Ready Pack with Corning's Valor ready-to-use vials. And as we continue to make tremendous strides in ESG, we have announced a stability partnership with the Philadelphia Eagles who are recognized as environmental stewards across all areas of their business. We look forward to sharing more detail on our ESG efforts in our corporate responsibility report to be published shortly. Shifting to Slide 8. A robust capital investments through expansions and optimizing productivity across our global operations remain on track. We continue to drive forward the expansion of additional HVP capacity with the anticipated growth of our customers' biologic portfolios and drug launches. This includes the installation and validation of new manufacturing equipment for HVP plungers and finishing capabilities, which will continue to come online throughout 2023 and into 2024. Moving to Slide 9. We are reiterating our full year 2023 organic sales growth outlook of 3% to 4% and are raising our 2023 financial outlook for overall net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. While Bernard will go over more details in his remarks, I want to make a few high-level comments. We continue to see a decline in overall COVID-19 sales and now expect $60 million for the full year 2023 instead of $85 million. Even with this change, we are reaffirming full year 2023 overall organic sales guidance. We continue to expect mid-teens Proprietary Products base organic sales growth for the year. Contract Manufacturing is now expected to be double-digit growth compared to prior high single-digit outlook as we expect to see continued demand for certain injection devices as seen in Q1. Now I'll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. We'll first look at Q1 2023 revenues and profits, where we saw low single-digit organic sales growth and a decline in operating profit and diluted EPS compared to the first quarter of 2022. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2023 guidance. First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 10, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 20. We recorded net sales of $716.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 2.3%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $23 million in the quarter, an approximate $88 million reduction compared to the prior year. These net revenues in 2022 include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. Looking at Slide 11, Proprietary Products organic net sales remained flat in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 70% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter, declined by low single digits due to the reduction in COVID-related net revenues. Looking at the performance of the market units, the Generics market unit delivered high double digits growth led by sales of Westar components, while the Pharma market unit experienced low double-digit growth led by Envision and Westar components as well as Admin Systems. And the Biologics market unit saw double-digit -- saw a double-digit decline due to a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine. Our Contract Manufacturing segment experienced double-digit net sales growth in the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in sales of components related to injection-related devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 23% was a 340 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 13.9% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefits, EPS decreased by approximately 16.1%. Now let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 12, we show the contributions to organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $38 million or 5.3 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Offsetting price was a negative mix impact of $21.3 million, primarily due to a reduction in COVID-19-related net demand and a foreign currency headwind of approximately $20.1 million. Looking at margin performance, Slide 13 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37.9% for Q1 2023, down from 39.5% in Q1 2022. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 42.5% was 90 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2022. The key drivers for the decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were unfavorable mix from a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccines and continued inflationary pressures on our planned costs, including labor, raw materials and overheads. These factors were partially offset by sales price increases and production efficiencies. Contract Manufacturing first quarter gross profit margin of 17.6% was 250 basis points below the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to mix of products sold. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 14, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $138.1 million for the 3 months ended March 2023, a decrease of $13.1 million compared to the same period last year, an 8.7% decrease, primarily due to a decline in operating results. Our first quarter of 2023 year-to-date capital spending was $82.1 million, $16.3 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity within our existing facilities in the U.S., Germany, Ireland and Singapore. Working capital of approximately $1.4 billion at March 31, 2023, remained consistent from December 31, 2022. Our cash balance at March 31 of $886.3 million was $8 million lower than our December 2022 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx, offset by operating cash flow for the first quarter. Turning to guidance, Slide 9 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full year 2023 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.965 billion to $2.99 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $2.935 billion to $2.96 billion. There is an estimated full year 2023 tailwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance of the 2023 headwind of $30 million. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%, unchanged from prior guidance. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.50 to $7.65 compared to a prior range of $7.25 to $7.40. Also, our CapEx guidance is $350 million for the year, unchanged from prior guidance. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. We expect full year COVID-19-related sales to be approximately $60 million compared to prior guidance of approximately $85 million. Net sales guidance also includes a reduction of $8 million, resulting from an expected divestiture of a European facility that produced standard Proprietary Product components. Full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an estimated FX tailwind of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of a headwind of $0.11. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.15 associated with first quarter 2023 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance does not include potential future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize, on Slide 15, the solid financial performance and execution in Q1 continues to reaffirm we have a strong base business and are delivering unique value to our customers. While there may be instability in some small cash-dependent biotechs, these customers are not a substantial portion of our business. Our end markets remain stable, and there continues to be a promising pipeline of new drugs that could have meaningful launches and/or expansions over the next few years, which means more HVP sales opportunities for West. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products in this complex environment with a focus on service and quality. And we're continuing to progress capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. With great pride, we realize this criticality of our products for health care across the globe, which is why our purpose to improve patient lives propels us each and every day. Norma, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Larry Scott : Congrats on another good start to the year. Eric, just sort of, I guess, a little bit of a quick question on the quarter and a little more high level. Just obviously, a little bit of a step-up in acceleration in sort of core growth. I think you mentioned mid-teens -- high-teens growth this quarter in Proprietary Products, and I think your guidance kind of points to sort of mid- to high-teens growth for the year. And obviously, it's a little bit of a shift away from COVID for you guys. Are your customers, from their perspective, has that helped too in terms of less focus on -- at some of your customers on co treatments and more back to their core? I'm just trying to bucket sort of the drivers of the acceleration of growth between COVID, perhaps a little bit waning COVID impacts and just more growth, I guess, in NovaPure and other high-value products. And I guess the third thing is just the overall growth in Biologics. But I'm just trying to get a feel for how those 3 drivers sort of line up, if you will. Eric Green : Yes. Great. Thank you, Larry. We're seeing -- obviously, as COVID demand decreases, we've been able to -- through the reprioritization of the long lead items, we're able to bring them back in line what we expect for the market. And therefore, you're seeing us -- very strong growth in both the Pharma and the Generics market units, which is significantly higher than what you would see from a market volume-demand perspective. So that's where you see the benefit, specifically on Generics is really due to the long lead times that are being brought in. We did see a little bit better performance in our Contract Manufacturing. And as we've been making investments specifically in that area, very targeted investments, those are coming online, and we're starting to see the benefit, and that's the reason why we moved up the full year look. On the Biologics side, I have to be -- I'm very proud on how we continue to do very well in that area, not just on current drugs in the market, but also new drug launches and our participation rate is -- remains very high. And so we were excited to carry on that growth. But you're absolutely correct, the COVID reduction mutes that overall number. And that's why we're trying to be more transparent about the core itself. So we're very -- we're pleased across the board on the execution. And overall, it's a very strong start to the year. Larry Scott : And in terms of capital projects, capital expansion plans, obviously, you guys, I think you've more than probably doubled capacity over the last couple of years or in the last 3 years. As you go out into '24, do you see -- I suppose at some point, we'll have a slowdown or a pause in the expansion. Do you view this? Or how do you sort of view that your longer-term plans out beyond sort of the next 12 months? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, it's -- you're right, we had some significant capital investments over the last couple of years. One was to fuel or build to support the vaccines during the pandemic. And fortunately, the team was very focused on helping our customers with these solutions around the higher end of high-value products. So this equipment is fungible. We're still leveraging that existing equipment for base business growth, particularly on the Biologics area. And we're continuing to add -- layer in more capital. The capital we are layering in right now is shifting a little bit away from what I would call the vial configuration to more prefilled syringes and, i.e., our plunger manufacturing capabilities, which are coming online this year and then in 2024. But that is based on demand that we have in our hands today and into the next couple of years. So we will continue to layer in capital when the growth profile remains as we're seeing today. But you're right, Larry, if there's opportunities to continue to leverage existing assets more effectively. That's the first thing we look at. How do we leverage what we currently have, create the efficiencies, higher automation before we start investing more, and that's a daily framework as we think about capital investment. So the long story short would be if we continue to invest as we are, it's because the growth of the business is greater than we anticipated. Larry Scott : Got you. And then just lastly, a quick question for Bernard. On Proprietary Products gross margin down a little, I think 90 bps year-over-year, but I think it absorbed like $90 million or so drop in COVID sales, right? So something around -- I don't think you can give the actual quarter number, but somewhere around there. So I'm just trying to -- going forward, gross margin, it feels like most of the COVID benefit is added there, right? So should we kind of expect Proprietary Products gross margin to this be maybe a good number, a good starting point and maybe we can grow a little bit off of this gross margin base? Bernard Birkett : Just on the COVID, we did -- you kind of said that we did $88 million, I think, in Q1 2022, and that was about $23 million in this quarter. So the drop was pretty significant. But we have been really focused on increasing the level of efficiency through our plants, really understanding the cost base and as we were progressing through 2022, we're already lining up changes. We're starting to see the impact there. Also, the price that we've been able to get, which is above what we would normally see, more than 5%, that's also helping with that margin and to absorb some of the inflationary costs. So I would expect it to -- it is a good start for the year. There's obviously a lot of puts and takes, given what's going on within the macro environment, but we're confident to deliver within our guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Paul Knight : Eric, when -- on the CapEx side, is Michigan now online? And then when you do deploy this CapEx, when does that start to deliver revenue? Is it a 1-year? Is it a 2-year lag? And then my last question would be, where do you benefit from this growth in GLP-1s? Eric Green : Yes. Thanks, Paul. So in the capital, fortunately, we're in a good position when we're layering in the capital once we install and then validates revenues are coming off rather quickly. So you mentioned about Grand Rapids, Michigan is one of our contract manufacturing sites. When the lines are ready to go, we'll turn them on and to be able to meet the demand requirements. And that's very consistent across proprietary and also see them in today's environment. I would say if you look back historically, while we made the right investments, sometimes we would do greenfield, those are the ones that take longer period to get the demand to fill those plants. But the investments we're making today are really about more near-term demand requirements. In some cases, we're trying to catch up. On the GLP-1, there's -- it's an interesting dynamic that is occurring. As you can imagine, West, as we did with the vaccines in the pandemic, you can imagine that our participation in GLP-1 with multiple customers, multiple components both in the proprietary area, but also in the contract manufacturing from an injectable device perspective. So we are obviously participating in that area. We're seeing the demand. We don't call out specific drugs or customers and -- but we are investing, particularly around plungers and also in the Contract Manufacturing area about injectors -- auto-injectors. So you've seen that in both camps as we speak today. Paul Knight : And then last question would be for Bernard. Bernard, what's your implied operating margin for the -- or guide for the year? Bernard Birkett : Approximately 23%. And just on Larry's question, I just want to clarify one thing. The difference is on the COVID revenue between Q1 2023 and 2022 is $88 million. Just to clarify that the drop was $88 million. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair. Matt Larew : For the space more broadly, the destocking has been an issue. And obviously, that's further upstream and not something that's really attractive for your business. But just on the subject to visibility, could you maybe speak to your visibility into customer demand right now, particularly around HVP, and maybe how that compares to your historical visibility over the last 3 to 5 years or so? Eric Green : Yes, Matt, I think before COVID, we were continuously building the capabilities to have better visibility with our customers in the markets around demand. And we have been building that, I would say, during the COVID period. It's been a little more volatile. But now we're back into that environment, have better visibility, better -- as we do make to order, our customers are giving us visibility of their demands over the next several quarters. And then we plan accordingly in our global operations to be able to support them on existing drugs but also new launches. In regards to any movements of stocking or working capital, we do see some of that in certain parts of the business. And we take that in consideration when we think about our forecast or guidance for the full year. There are certain areas, I would say, probably more on our non-HVP area that might have more volatility. On the high-value product area, that is going back to our capital investments, we need to continue to fuel that to try to get ahead of the curve versus trying to maintain where we are right now. So the demand is greater than we have capacity in as we speak. So it's just seen blend right now, Matt, and we have better visibility. But it's not consistent across the whole portfolio, but I think we're responding appropriately. Matt Larew : Okay. And then decommissioning a plant in Europe, making both products amidst significant investment in HVP capacity, I guess that speaks to the change in order book. But maybe could you just give us a sense for, as we think about order book occurring today and what sort of what's in your order pipeline over the next 6 months, 12 months, how that compares to 3 or 5 years ago? And then specifically on -- you mentioned on the GLP-1s, you participate on the plunger side. Are those NovaPure plungers, I assume? Eric Green : Well, Matt, a couple of points there. One is, you're right, the decommissioning of the plant, that's a plant that is a single product, single customer. And we're very pleased on how that is now -- that was a standard product. So it wasn't that in relation to high-value products. Right. It's a standard price is basically we've had this discussion for a long time. It doesn't fit our growth strategy. So therefore, we've made the decision with our customer and also another party to make sure that they can continue on producing those products for our customers but in someone else's hands. I think from an order book perspective, if you think about where our growth profile is really is around the Biologics, we obviously have high growth right now in Generics and Pharma. We'll continue to see that over the course of 2023. But really, as you think about the future longer term, it is around the biologics in multiple therapeutic categories, and it tends to be the higher end of our high-value products. The plunger, specifically, it's a range of different types of plungers within high-value products. So it ranges anywhere from FluroTec all the way up to NovaPure, depending on the customers' needs. So it is kind of a range. But our -- the optics of our order book continues to be strong, but this portion of that tends to be more around the high-value products and the higher end of that. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Maybe first, just sticking on the GLP-1 topic. And as it relates to contract manufacturing, I think that's a business that at times kind of the work you do with customers can vary year-to-year. Obviously, strong start to the year. You're increasing expectations there. Is this something that is kind of sustainable growth for you all? Or is there something about 2023 that maybe we shouldn't carry this forward into 2024 and beyond? Bernard Birkett : Yes, Jacob typically would the growth rate in contract manufacturing around mid-single digits within our longer-term construct. Last year, we had declines in the Contract Manufacturing business, and now we're seeing a bit of a rebound. So if I'm looking out past 2023, it will be kind of more the mid-single, high single-digit growth rate. Jacob Johnson : Okay. And then just a couple of kind of cleanups on some of the commentary around the outlook for this year. If I'm not mistaken, I think you said mid-teens ex COVID growth in proprietary products. But I think that was high teens last -- on the last call. And then off the 23% op margins, I think that was 23% to 24% last quarter. Is this something to do with kind of the stronger Contract Manufacturing growth in the -- for the year? Just anything you can kind of flesh out in terms of that commentary. Bernard Birkett : Yes. On the operating margin, a little bit of it is around Contract Manufacturing. And then they're having less -- that COVID business coming through versus what we expected. So they are the primary drivers there. Eric Green : On the revenue side, when we talk about the proprietary outlook, it's relatively -- it's pretty consistent to the COVID guidance in February without COVID. So the -- all 3 units will be very strong throughout the full year and relatively consistent as far as performance in that area. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : A couple of questions. Is there a good rule of thumb to think about your CapEx in terms of revenue generation? For every dollar you spend in CapEx, it can generate X amount of revenues. I'm just trying to think about future opportunities and just sort of thinking about all the spend and how West will build it out. Bernard Birkett : Yes. We haven't communicated that in the past. I think we -- what we have communicated is to say that a larger portion of our CapEx spend over the last number of years has been focused on growth, and that growth is really within high-value products. So the investment in CapEx is driving obviously both revenue improvement, but also delivering on that operating margin improvement, so it's encompassed in that. Derik De Bruin : So going down, so was going to the mix shift next because obviously, that has accelerated recently. When you think about your forward model construct, are -- does that margin sort of look more like 150 basis points? Or are you still thinking about 100 basis points is where you should come out on the op margin expansion on an annual basis, just given the mix? Eric Green : Yes, Derik, I'm not going to give you a number, but we've said that we will achieve a 100-plus basis point margin expansion year-over-year for a number of years. And -- but as an organization, as a team, we're really focused on how can we continue to beat that. Looking at through automation, looking at the mix shift effect that's happening, really when you think about the Biologics, just reviewing the -- our participation in Biologics more recently continues to remain extremely strong. I'm very proud of that. And so we believe we're going to commit to the 100-plus basis points in operating margin, but we do believe there's opportunities to continue that and stay aggressive. Derik De Bruin : Great. And just one more. So I'm thinking about some of the newer drug opportunities. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of interest in discussion on GLPs. But you've had to build capacity for a number of -- I mean this isn't like COVID where it suddenly popped up overnight. I mean you've been building capacity for a while. You've known there were trials coming. So I'm just sort of curious like what do we need to see in sort of some of the GLP trends in the market, prescription trends to sort of like think about what the upside driver of that could be to your business? Because there's clearly something already embedded in, it isn't like a virgin market where you are. So I'm just curious on how you're thinking about that market as it expands. Eric Green : There's 2 areas. One area, specifically around our product portfolio, unlike what we've seen in other types of configurations like vial configuration, we can get multiple doses per vial. In this particular area is single dose, right? And so as prefilled syringes continue to grow, we're going to need to continue to invest in plungers. And that's what we're seeing, and that's where our areas of investments are going. And we'll continue to respond to our customers' forecasted demand. And again, it's more than just one customer, it's multiple customers. So that's one. It's around the conversations with our customers planning ahead, not on just existing solutions in the market, but future drug launches that they're planning, that's where our conversation is. If we're waiting to the commercialization of them, we were today and they're today. So that's one area. On the Contract Manufacturing side, a little different where, as you know, we've been very clear about this, that part of our business, unlike our proprietary business where if you're on the molecule, you're pretty much the main provider of those components. In the Contract Manufacturing, our customers tend to diversify with multiple companies to be able to produce those, i.e., auto injectors. So while that volume goes up, I wouldn't say it's 1 to 1 for us. It's clear in the proprietary side, but not as much on the Contract Manufacturing side. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of kind of visibility and particularly around the GLP-1 specific area. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Sourbeer with UBS. John Sourbeer : So I think it sounds like you said that contract manufacturing that, that could grow from mid-single digits, I think, was the previous long-term target there to mid-single to high single digits. Is that increase over the long term, is that all GLP-1s? Or are there other drivers there that would be driving that upside? Eric Green : Well, I would say it's just a mixture of multiple -- a few different customers in a few different products. GLP would be one area, but not the only area of growth. So the investments that we've been layering in, specifically in contract manufacturing, have been coming on board end of last year into this year. And we'll continue to layer that in, if and when necessary, with our customers. So yes, there's a portion of it is due to GLP-1. John Sourbeer : Just when you look -- I think the company has framed that the long-term revenue target in that high single-digit range, but now you're seeing strong trends throughout the portfolio, some increases in Contract Manufacturing. Just any thoughts on how that revenue growth could look like beyond 2023. Eric Green : Yes. I think the same focus on the long-term construct to a [indiscernible] 7% to 9% organic sales growth. We're excited that, obviously, we do have a role to play with the GLP-1 as that evolves. I'm excited because as an organization, we can support our customers in multiple fronts, i.e., multiple different components in proprietary. That, to me, has a higher economic profile for us and then the Contract Manufacturing, while we play in both higher dependency on the proprietary side. But I would say that our growth, when we say the 7% to 9% organic growth outlook, it's not solely reliant on that category. We have numerous customers with different types of launches that are turning and uptake of current drugs in the market that we need to keep fueling. So it's a mixture of multiple drugs, multiple customers and multiple therapy classes. Yes, we participate in GLP-1, but I want to make sure that it's -- the growth of this business is very diversified. Operator : And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Quintin Lai for closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Norma, and thank you all of us for joining us on today's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the DTE Energy Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I would like to turn things over to Ms. Barbara Tuckfield, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Barbara Tuckfield : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the safe harbor statement on Page two of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the appendix. With us this morning are Gerry Norcia, Chairman and CEO; and Dave Ruud, Executive Vice President and CFO. And now I'll turn it over to Gerry to start the call this morning. Gerry Norcia : Well, thanks, Barb, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This morning, I will be discussing the achievements we've made so far this year and provide a general business update. I'll discuss the progress of our regulatory proceedings including the details of our IRP settlement. Dave will provide a financial update and wrap things up before we take your questions. Before we dive in, I want to take this opportunity to touch on some recent appointments to our regulatory commission here in Michigan. Governor Whitmer extended Chair Dan Scripps term an additional six years to 2029. The reappointment of Chair Scripps provides consistency and regulatory leadership and we appreciate the balance he has always brought to the commission. We congratulate Chair Scripps and look forward to continuing to work with them. Governor Whitmer also appointed Alessandra Carillon as a new commissioner to the MPSC, filling the vacant role left by Germain Phillips. We look forward to working with her as she comes to his position with a strong background in electrification.  Moving on to Slide 4. We remain committed to supporting and delivering for all our stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities and shareholders. I always say that employee engagement drives our success, and our team continues to operate at top decile engagement levels as measured by the Gallup organization. I'm proud that our team's excellence in this area was recognized by earning the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award for the 11th consecutive year. We also received great news that DTE was named one of Metro Detroit's best and brightest companies to work for. The best and brightest program recognizes companies that have a commitment to excellence in their human resource practices and employee enrichment based on categories, including work life balance, employee education and diversity.  I'm happy to say that yesterday, the MPSC approved our IRP settlement agreement, which outlines our investment in Michigan's clean energy future, two weeks after we filed it. This demonstrates the supportive nature of our regulatory environment. We are proud that this plan puts our customers first by reducing the cost of our clean energy transformation, while reliably generating the cleaner, affordable energy that our customers will rely on for years to come. I'll provide more details on the settlement agreement in a few minutes. On the community front, DTE was honored to be named to the Civic 50 for the sixth consecutive year. This award presented by Points of Light recognized us as the most community-minded companies in the nation. I am proud that our team continues to put communities we serve at the forefront each and every day in our decision-making and earning this award year after year recognizes that. On the investor front, we are executing on our plan to achieve our 2023 guidance midpoint and our long-term financial growth. As you know, we have been facing headwinds with the weather and storms that we experienced earlier this year. Dave will go into more details on this, but the team has made excellent progress on the cost management work across the entire company, and we continue to find savings with our continuous improvement efforts. As well, we are seeing additional favorability across our portfolio of businesses. We are well positioned to continue to deliver the strong performance and premium growth that DTE is known for delivering on our 2023 midpoint guidance and also continue to deliver long-term EPS growth of 6% to 8%. Let's turn to Slide five and discuss the IRP settlement agreement. We want to thank our DTE employees and 21 organizations from across Michigan for their diligent work on this IRP settlement agreement. We completed a comprehensive analysis that reflected insights shared by our customers and other stakeholders to build the plan. The plan offers a balanced and diversified approach for the transition of our generation fleet, complementing our commitment to build a reliable and resilient grid while maintaining customer affordability. A key provision of the settlement agreement is ending DTE's use of coal in 2032. DTE will provide retraining for employees impacted by the plant retirements, and we'll continue to partner with the local communities on new economic development opportunities. We are continuing our plan to cease coal use at our Bell River power plant in 2026 and converted to a 1,300-megawatt natural gas peaking resource. We are retiring two coal units at Monroe in 2028 and accelerating the retirement of our two remaining units from 2035 to 2032, which is nearly 12 years earlier than originally planned.  To determine the best replacement alternative for the capacity of Monroe, we will be studying a range of possible replacement technologies. Facilitated by these accelerations, our 85% carbon reduction goal moves from 2035 to 2032. To support these retirements, we are transforming how the company generates electricity over the next two decades. We will be developing more than 15,000 megawatts of renewables by 2042 to power homes, businesses and industrial facilities. Additionally, we will build more than 1,800 megawatts of energy storage to support the company's clean energy transformation. Through all of this, our focus remains in providing what our customers and communities need, clean, affordable, reliable energy. This IRP is also very positive for customer affordability as it provides over $2.5 billion in future cost savings, and we will be directing $110 million to support our most vulnerable customers, including $70 million to energy efficiency programs, $30 million in bill assistance and $8 million in home repairs facilitate cleaner energy for low-income customers. Through this IRP, we will be delivering long-term customer value by investing over $11 billion in the next 10 years in a clean energy transition, supporting more than 32,000 Michigan jobs. Let's move to Slide six to discuss how the IRP fits into our plan. This IRP supports our long-term capital plan as it solidifies a large portion of our planned investment in cleaner generation. As you recall, we will be investing $21.6 billion in our two utilities in the next five years and $45 billion over the next 10 years. all to build the grid of the future, transition to cleaner generation and modernize the gas transmission and distribution system. The significant additions of renewables and storage outlined in this plan in addition to the renewables investments we are doing through our voluntary renewable program provides surety to our cleaner generation investment plan. The IRP provides full recovery of the net book value of Bell River and Monroe. A portion of the assets are securitized to balance customer affordability with the increased investment in clean energy while supporting our financial plan. For Bell River, we will be depreciating the majority of the asset since it will remain in service earning the authorized ROE currently at 9.9%. A small portion of the net book value will be securitized after 2026. For Monroe, we received constructive regulatory asset treatment for the majority of the undepreciated coal unit investment balances with a 9% return on equity. The remaining portion of the assets will be securitized beginning in 2032. We will receive our full authorized ROE, which is 9.9% until 2032, at which point that portion will be securitized. So this plan is a really great outcome. Selling this case confirms the constructive nature of the regulatory environment in Michigan and DTE's ability to gain consensus with key stakeholders, including the MPSC staff, the attorney general, environmental, industrial and regulatory groups. It is consistent and supports our 5-year financial plan and our 6% to 8% EPS growth rate. It also provides visibility and surety and the long-term capital plan. And this settlement overall is good for customers and aligns with the state's goals to provide clean, affordable, reliable energy in Michigan. We will be updating our full 5-year financial plan at EEI. As with any of our plans, we continue to balance increases in investments in clean generation distribution infrastructure and base infrastructure with affordability for our customers. Now let's turn to our other accomplishments this quarter on Slide 7. Our team has accomplished a lot so far this year.  At DTE Electric, we placed Michigan's largest wind park in service, the Meridian Wind Park, spanning three townships, the 225-megawatt wind park has 77 wind turbines and generates enough clean energy to power more than 78,000 homes. In addition to bringing even more clean energy to the grid and supporting Michigan's overall de-carbonization goals, these types of projects help strengthen our economy by creating jobs and by bringing additional tax revenue to our communities. Additionally, last month, Dakota, a native American and women-owned automotive supplier joined our voluntary renewables program. Dakota joins 15 automotive suppliers who are using my green power to make their operations more sustainable. This continues to demonstrate the success of our voluntary renewable program that currently has over 2,300 megawatts of commitments, including participation of over 90,000 residential customers, making us the largest voluntary renewable program in the state of Michigan and one of the largest in the country. We are continuing our focus on improved reliability of our electric grid. We trained more than 25,000 miles of trees over the last five years and will trim an additional 5,000 miles in 2023, of which we have completed 2,800 miles through the first half of this year. The electric rate case is progressing as we continue to pursue a constructive settlement with all stakeholders. At DTE Gas, our main renewal work marches steadily along. We've completed over 150 miles of renewal in the first half of 2023. Our natural gas balance program also continues to grow. We now have over 12,000 customers subscribed since program inception in 2021. In the second quarter, the city of East Grand Rapids was the first municipality in Michigan to join the program to help lower its carbon footprint, and we invite more municipalities to participate in this great program. Moving on to DTE Vantage. As we mentioned earlier this year, we have placed two projects in service so far in 2023. One RNG and one custom Energy Solutions project.  We are on track to place two additional RNG projects in service by year-end and are in advanced discussions on an additional customer energy solutions project. We also continue to advance our development pipeline with strong opportunities in both RNG conversions and large custom energy solutions projects. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave to give you a financial update. Dave, over to you. Dave Ruud : Thanks, Gerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide eight to review our second quarter financial results. Operating earnings for the quarter were $206 million. This translates into $0.99 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $178 million for the quarter. This is $8 million lower than the second quarter of 2022.  The main driver of the earnings variance was cooler weather. There's also lower residential sales relative to 2022 with the continuation of people returning to work, higher rate base costs and accelerated deferred tax amortization in 2022. This was partially offset by the onetime O&M cost reductions that we have implemented in 2023. Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $24 million, $18 million higher than the second quarter of 2022. The earnings variance was driven by onetime O&M cost reductions and IRM revenue in 2023, partially offset by higher rate base costs. Let's move to DTE Vantage on the third row. Operating earnings were $26 million in the second quarter of 2023. This is a $2 million decrease from the second quarter last year primarily due to planned outage timing at our renewables plans. On the next row, you can see Energy Trading finished the quarter with earnings of $36 million, which is $29 million higher than the second quarter last year. As I mentioned in Q1, there is some timing variability this year that is now positive in the second quarter. This is primarily due to contracts in our power physical business that include revenue based on fixed prices over the term of the transaction, and then these contracts are hedged upon execution.  We sell the energy at a fixed price for these contracts while the recognized cost synergies based on the energy curve, which was higher in January and February. This timing variance that we saw in the first quarter has begun to unwind as expected. We also had performance favorability in energy trading this quarter due to robust contract premiums in our physical power portfolio for 2023. Through the first half of the year, Energy Trading has earnings of $10 million. Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable by $2 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $0.99 per share in the second quarter. Let's turn to slide nine to discuss our 2023 guidance.  Let me start at the bottom of the page and tell you that we remain on track to deliver on the overall EPS guidance we have for 2023, and we have plans to achieve the midpoint of our guidance range. As we have discussed, we have faced headwinds at DTE Electric this year. This includes the lower-than-expected rate order received at the end of last year, driven by a difference in sales forecast of approximately $100 million. We had a $70 million impact from the winter storms in the first quarter and unfavorable weather of $42 million in the first half of the year. Through focused onetime cost reduction efforts, DTE Electric is achieving offsets for over half of these headwinds without sacrificing safety reliability or customer service.  However, electric will likely still fall below its guidance range as represented by the Red Arrow. Favorability at each of our other business units will overcome the remaining headwinds and achieve our EPS guidance. This is depicted by the green arrows indicating they will likely be above their guidance ranges. Additional favorability at DTE Gas is driven by onetime O&M reductions. DTE Vantage favorability is driven by stronger R&G pricing, additional projects coming into service and opportunistic contracted sales in the steel business. Energy Trading is seeing favorability in its contracted, highly hedged power portfolio, which will continue to provide additional upside to this business.  All the business units implemented onetime O&M reductions and also benefit from onetime corporate O&M reductions at Cascade to all the business units. Through the performance of our portfolio, we have plans to achieve the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance range for DTE and we'll update the business unit guidance after the summer weather plays out. Our guidance does assume historically average weather for the remainder of the year without the normal contingency that we typically build into the plan. Our team has really made excellent progress identifying and implementing the opportunities in onetime O&M reductions across the company while ensuring the reliability and safety that our customers expect. This allows us to continue to deliver for all our stakeholders.  The performance this year will allow us to continue to be very well positioned to achieve our long-term EPS growth and the premium returns that our shareholders have come to expect from us. Let me wrap up on slide 10, and then we will open the line for questions. In summary, through the remainder of the year, DTE will continue to focus on our team, customers, communities and investors. We are executing on our plan to achieve full year guidance without jeopardizing safety and reliability.  Our utility regulatory filings continue to advance as evidenced by our recent IRP settlement. We also continue to pursue a constructive settlement in our electric rate case. Our robust capital plan supports our long-term operating EPS growth as we execute on the critical investment that we need to make for our customers to deliver cleaner generation and increased reliability while focusing on customer affordability. Our long-term plan supports our 6% to 8% operating EPS growth target through 2027 and provides a dividend growing in line with operating EPS. With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to Jeremy Tonet at JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start with the electric rate case proceeding, if I could here. And appreciate where we are at the process only so much could be said. But are you able to expand at all on how this has been progressing? And I guess, hopes for settlement at this point when that might materialize? Or just any other color in general would be helpful. Gerry Norcia : Our target, Jeremy, to settled the rate case is mid-October, and before the PFD is issued. So we have started some conversations and those conversations, obviously, will become a lot more intense through the summer. But I believe we have the ingredients for settlement, and we'll continue to update you on that as we progress. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. Just wondering, I guess, to the ability you're able to comment for weather for the third quarter. Obviously, the big swing quarter for the year. How do things look so far in your jurisdictions and kind of like what you can see over the next couple of weeks. Just wondering if weather help in 3Q could materialize relative to what we saw earlier in the year? Dave Ruud : Yes, Jeremy. So far, we're seeing things start out pretty close to what we had expected. And so as you know, though, August and September can be really big months for us or really big swing months. So continue to watch that closely as the weather plays out. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And just last one, if I could. I think for DTE Vantage, there was some opportunistic steel sales, and just wondering if you could expand a bit more on what that was in other -- are there other items like that, that we should look for to kind of service offsets? Dave Ruud : Yes. We're looking across our portfolio for offsets. And with the ones we have within our steel portfolio, represent that. We have some byproducts that we sell as a process of what we're doing within our steel business and our cope making. And we just got some opportunistic pricing and some really good pricing for that through the year that we've been able to take advantage of this year. And I'll say, Jeremy, across our whole portfolio, we continue to look for these onetime cost reductions and some of these opportunities like this to ensure that we can deliver for the year. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. Gerry Norcia : So just to add to that, we're also seeing some lift in RNG pricing, which is also creating some favorability at Vantage. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Understood. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Shahr Pourreza at Guggenheim. Shahriar Pourreza : Hi, good morning. Good morning, David. [indiscernible]. Congrats on good quarter. So just kind of appreciating the challenging weather as Jeremy mentioned, and it looks like there was another $0.12 versus normal. How should we think about the flex O&M for the remainder of the year? And is there a need to kind of shift anything from what you embedded at the end of the first quarter? Dave Ruud : Yes. As we play out the year, we're looking for the opportunities across the business, again, to ensure that we can offset the challenges that we've seen through storm and weather as we go through the year. And so we're doing that across our portfolio. We as an extended leadership team, we're meeting weekly to ensure that we're finding all the opportunities we can and extinguishing all the risks. And through the year, we've been able to find some additional opportunities that have been able to offset the challenges that we've seen through weather and through the storm we saw in the first quarter. So we'll continue to look for that flex throughout the year. Gerry Norcia : Yes. And just to add color to some of the areas where we're diving into to look for these opportunities. We're taking full advantage of attrition. So we're only hiring critical operating roles to make sure that we have safe and reliable operations. Some of the other onetime initiatives are happening across all the staffs groups as well in terms of attrition. A significant reduction in overtime. We've deferred noncritical maintenance and pulling out some of the bank maintenance that we did when we had surpluses in prior years. We've had contractor workforce reductions. And then, of course, as Dave mentioned, we're seeing favorability, market favorability in our gas business as well as at Advantage and trading for that matter. In addition, we've also started to renegotiate supply chain contracts with long-term relationships to give us some value. So we we're hitting all the buttons and we're learning a lot about our company. And some of these will stick, but by far and large, most of them are one time, but I'm really proud of the team because we're hitting all the targets that we've given them to offset these significant headwinds. Shahriar Pourreza : So I guess it would be fair to say kind of no big changes just executing on the plan from 1Q? Gerry Norcia : That's correct. Shahriar Pourreza : Excellent. And then maybe shifting to efficient financing. Just how are you thinking about supporting credit metrics on a tighter capital market environment, especially as we continue to see high levels of investment in rate base growth? And just any thoughts on internal versus external balance sheet support? As you mentioned the Vantage assets are potentially helping. But maybe how are those -- the value of those assets stacking up against any future equity needs? Dave Ruud : Well, yes, if you look at our overall financing plan, we have some good headroom to our FFO to debt levels with the rating agencies. So we have some room there. And as we've said in our equity plan, our plan on equity is zero to $100 million over the next few years. So very low equity needs that we would do through internal methods. So we're seeing that we're still in a really good place on our balance sheet from both a debt and equity standpoint. Shahriar Pourreza : Excellent. And maybe last one, housekeeping call out, following up on Jeremy's question on the rate case. There's been some data points on kind of higher ROEs that potentially the ranges that kind of have been recommended and that shows some recognition from stakeholders. Do you anticipate that, that will start to make an impact, whether in the '24 time frame or just in settlement negotiations? Gerry Norcia : Well, we've filed for high ROE. I mean it will be part of the settlement negotiations. The pattern, I think that we've seen from the commission in the past that it's slow up and a slow down. So it will be -- whatever happens, it will be extremely gradual. But certainly, we've asked for higher ROEs and that will be part of our settlement discussions. Shahriar Pourreza : Excellent. I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We'll go next now to Julian Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Heidi Hauchon : This is Heidi Hauchon for Julian. Thank you for taking my question. Gerry Norcia : Good morning. Dave Ruud : Hi, Heidi. Heidi Hauchon : Good morning. Hi. Just my first question and kind of a follow-up to the rate case, what has been the ongoing stakeholder feedback to some of your proposals in the electric rate case like the IRM? And then following intervener testimony, are you exploring any incremental mechanisms such as, for example, ring-fencing of vegetation management spend or something similar? Gerry Norcia : Sure. So there's been certainly a positive support from the staff for the IRM and we're getting all the right signals that this is something that will be really valuable to our customers. And can help secure the investments that's necessary to move towards a more resilient and reliable grid. That one feels encouraging. In terms of ring-fencing tree, we've essentially done that already through past proceedings where a good portion of it is ring fenced. And we're executing against that plan. And actually in good years when we've had surpluses, we've even put more against tree trimming because we see it as a significant labor in terms of reducing customer outages. So I feel that our positions are productive, positions that we've seen in the various parties, and we're going to work hard to get towards a settlement before the middle of October. Heidi Hauchon : Great. Thank you. And then also, can you comment on weather adjusted sales trends year-to-date, and how this factors into low growth forecast or whether this is consistent with your expectations? Dave Ruud : Yes. Our sales have come in exactly as we expected on a weather-adjusted basis this year. If we look back to last year, residential sales are down about 3.5% to 4%. And that's really what we have predicted with people returning to work. Our commercial is down a little bit due to energy efficiency and some other things and our industrial is up as our plants in Michigan are experiencing a lot less downtime. So I think now we've seen that our sales are kind of at the right level or where they are with people return to work and kind of very consistent with what we have forecasted through the year. Heidi Hauchon : Thank you. That's helpful. And then just really quick last one from me. We've seen some reports this morning of storm causing outages in your service jurisdiction. Just wondering, I know it's early but can you comment on restoration efforts this morning and kind of severity of these storms relative to expected storm activity or normal storm activity? And then finally, on your level of confidence in achieving guidance in light of storms. I know we've touched on weather, but specifically on storms? Thank you. Gerry Norcia : So we did have some storm weather moved in last night. Approximately 92% to 93% of our customers have power at this moment. And we've mobilized about almost 3,000 of our team members to address the storm conditions. So we'll ramp most of it up in the next couple of days. These types of storms are pretty typical in July and August. So nothing out of the ordinary at this point in time. In terms of achieving guidance, as I mentioned and Dave has mentioned, we have seen about $200 million of headwinds, and we have a plan that addresses these headwinds. And those headwinds included some of the firestorm activity and cooler weather that we experienced and warmer weather in the winter. Many of the initiatives will be onetime in nature, but we're learning, as I mentioned, a lot more about our company and which is good for us and good for our customers. And the team is achieving the plan right on top of the plant. We've asked them for some significant delivery on initiatives and they're delivering on that plan. So I'm proud of their accomplishments, and that will land us at the midpoint of our guidance. Heidi Hauchon : Great. Congrats on the results.  Operator  We go next now to Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. MichaelSullivan : I just had a quick one on the IRP. I was just wondering if we could get a little more color on -- you mentioned like studying technology to replace Monroe and kind of what that could look like? I think originally, in the plan, you may have had a gas plant with carbon capture in there. Did that end up making it into the official plan? Or what sort of other solutions are on the table there? Gerry Norcia : Yes. What we have settled on, Michael, was that we'd file another IRP in several years, and that would really be the, what I would say, the key topic for the last two units of Monroe, retiring those two in 2032. So the agreement between the parties and us, of course, was that look a lot could change in two or three years. But we will need a dispatchable resource there. We have proposed a combined cycle plan with carbon capture. And so we'll have to study that as an option amongst many other options, more batteries, more renewables. But definitely, very large resource that we count on from that part of the service territory to feed our industrial base in Detroit. And so we'll need a dispatchable resource that's going to be high quality and a 24/7 resource. So it will look like that. It would be maybe a mixture of -- it's just hard to tell right now where those studies will take us, but we agreed to study that together as a stakeholder group. So we've got time to do that one. Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then another one on the IRP. I think somewhere in there was mentioned potentially looking at IRA funding for the Belle River conversion. Can you talk a little bit about that and how that may help customers or your plan? Gerry Norcia : Go ahead, Dave. Dave Ruud : Yes. What we mentioned there for the Belle River conversion with some of the DOE funds that are now available for replacing or repowering energy infrastructure that gets ceased and it kind of fits right into what this Belle River conversion is. So along with some other capital investment opportunity we have, we're going to look right at Belle River and see if there's some DOE funding that can come in and they can give lower interest rate that can really help with customer affordability as we're building out our infrastructure renewal and clear generation plan. Michael Sullivan : Okay. And any sense of timing on when that plays out when you know you can get the funds worked on? Dave Ruud : As we get closer, we'll know it will be over the next few years, those funds are available for I forget the timing four or five years on that. So we have some time to get that. But it's just an opportunity to get some lower interest rates for our customers and lower overall expense. Gerry Norcia : Mike, as you know, we have a long list of capital projects waiting to get into the plant. So as we find unique ways to finance some of it, it will allow us to accelerate our journey in other areas like, for example, with our grid. The more opportunity to find like that to make more headroom, we'll take full advantage of it. Operator : And we'll go now to David Arcaro at Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I was wondering, just in your arsenal of cost-cutting measures or offset measures. I was wondering if there are financial tools that you might have at your disposal that you've considered? Just thinking that CMS, did a tender offer recently on one of their outstanding bonds, things like that? Are those things that you would consider for offsetting weather headwinds this year? Dave Ruud : We always look across the portfolio for opportunities. We've looked at convertible debt. We don't have much more corporate debt we need to do this year. And we'll look for other opportunities like that. But right now, we don't see a similar opportunity or what they brought up. And of course, anything we do, we want to make sure that we maximize the overall value for shareholders, too. Q \u2013 David Arcaro : Got it. And then separately, could you just give an update on what we could expect to see in the updated distribution grid plan this year and what the timing might be for that? Gerry Norcia : We will file that before the end of the year as required by the commission. And it will really address four major buckets. The continued surge of tree trim, which we expect to end in two years, but then we'll be more of a maintenance cycle. So that will be a key feature. What we call pull-top maintenance, which is replacement of press arms, insulators equipment that pulls themselves. That will be a big part of the plan on our aging system.  Third is automation, trying to accomplish full automation of the grid in five years, that will be a major component of the plan. As we've seen more frequent storms and more sizable storms over the years, automation will be a big lever for us to restoration of outages.  And then lastly, as I've mentioned before, 1/3 of our grid is quite old. It's a 4,800 volt system, and that was installed in the early 1900s through the '60s and we need to replace that, and that's about 16,000 miles.  So that will be also a part of this updated plan to really accelerate our journey to try and get that done over the next 15 or 20 years. So those are the major components that you'll see. There'll be other things there, but those will be the four big hitters in the distribution grade plan. Operator : We go next to now to Alex Mortimer at Mizuho. Alex Mortimer : With the new commissioners focused on electric vehicles, how do you think about the upside for low CapEx and rate base above what you might currently have included in your plan? Gerry Norcia : Well, look, we're a big proponent of transportation electrification for several reasons. One is it's great for the environment. I mean the transportation sector I believe now the largest emitter of carbon in the economy. So I believe it's going to be very valuable for that.  But secondly, obviously, we get nice investment opportunity from that in the sense that it creates headroom for our investments as we see more load coming on. It is not fundamental just yet, but we expect that near the end of our 5-year plan, we'll start to see it be pretty significant contribution to margin growth. And that will help finance a lot of these large investments that we're making now to prepare ourselves for the electrification and transportation fleet as well as the deal with the inclement weather that we continue to see.  So we're pretty excited about it. We're happy that obviously, our new commissioner is very supportive of that agenda, but the other two commissioners are as well. So lots to do there. And we also have an administration that's quite supportive of electrification. So we're pretty excited about the prospects in the future. But like I said, it will start to become more impactful in our plan from a margin creation perspective later in the 5-year period. From an investment perspective, we're already investing against this opportunity. Alex Mortimer : Okay. Understood. And then just given the additional headwinds present this quarter, should we essentially understand that all contingency has been exhausted at this point, and you now need normal weather for the balance of the year to achieve the stated goal midpoint of guidance? Gerry Norcia : I would say that contingency in the electric company has been exhausted, but some of our other BUs still have a bit of contingency, but we are relying on normal weather both from a temperature perspective and storm activity perspective. Alex Mortimer : Okay. And then other than weather in a more kind of \"normal year\" kind of what would get you to the high middle and low point of your guidance? And is the bias still towards the middle in a more normal year? Gerry Norcia : I would say the bias is the -- our target and the bias is towards the midpoint at this point in time. Operator : Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions this morning. Mr. Norcia, I'd like to turn things back to you for any closing comments. Gerry Norcia : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll just close by saying I hope everyone has a great morning and a safe day. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Norcia. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the DTE Energy Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Again, I would like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Westrock Coffee Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference call. My name is Tanya, and I'll be coordinating your call today. Following prepared remarks we will open your call to questions with instructions to be given at that time. I would now like to hand it over to Clay Crumbliss with ICR. Clay Crumbliss : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Westrock Coffee Company's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. With us are Mr. Scott Ford, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Chris Pledger, Chief Financial Officer. By now, everyone should have access to the company's third quarter earnings release issued earlier today. This information is available on the Investor Relations section of Westrock Coffee Company's website at investors.westrockcoffee.com. Certain comments made on this call include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and are subject to several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to today's press releases and other filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. Also, discussions during the call will use some non-GAAP financial measures as we describe business performance. The SEC filings as well as the earnings press release provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. And with that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott Ford, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. Scott? Scott Ford : Thank you, Clay and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll be the first to acknowledge that our third quarter this year looks like a bit of a mess as a variance from our targeted performance of roughly $20 million in adjusted EBITDA for the period and our reported results of $11.6 million appears quite large at first glance. That said, I think it's critically important to call out that virtually 100% of the miss comes from two distinct causes that were unique to the period. First, over $6 million of the miss happened in July and August alone in our traditional roast and ground coffee unit, where these customers ordered fewer pounds in this period than they did in the depths of COVID. As we work with them and our forecast analysts, we were repeatedly informed that the spike in gasoline prices, coupled with the spike in interest rates, combined with a measurably hot summer kept consumers out of restaurants and C-stores in the first two months of the quarter.  Fortunately, September was largely back to normal versus prior years in roast and ground coffee volumes and October and early November are coming in at normal levels as well. So this appears to me to have been the same transient crunch that happened last year when gasoline prices spiked as oil went above $85 a barrel and demand came back for coffee as soon as oil prices retreated a bit. Secondly, as Chris will detail in a few moments, we incurred almost $2 million of expenses during this quarter that were associated offsets to prior periods, further compounding the stated performance GAAP. And I fully realize that GAAP does not allow us to go back and add these items back, if you will. But in terms of clearly laying out what is going on in our business, this $8 million of combined EBITDA pressure equates to 100% of our adjusted EBITDA miss for the quarter compared to the updated guidance we gave you after our second quarter. We will continue to head down to deliver all that we can in 2023, looking for ways to drive revenues up and costs down. Turning now to the Conway extract and RTD plan. I want to commend and thank the team that has tirelessly fought to convert that plant and distribution facility from rendering on the drawing board to the finest facilities of their type in the country in what has to be record time. It has been a joint effort of Westrock employees, professional service providers, equipment vendors, customer product development, QA and procurement leaders and the two primary general contractors involved, Nabholz Construction and Clark Construction Co. Each individual involved is dedicated to the successful completion, product commercialization, and operational launch of this new $300 million extract and ready-to-drink facility in Conway. Which is on schedule to successfully begin commercial production of finished product in the second quarter of 2024. This Conway facility is coming online just as we have essentially now finished selling out 100% of our extract manufacturing capacity in Concord North Caroline. So overall, while it is a bit of a difficult time for the core coffee market, where we continue to compete for customer volumes as they ebb and flow through the seasons and gasoline price generations, it is an absolutely glorious time to be in the extract and RTD space as our new customer and product extensions continue to expand and where we are about to open our third extracted ingredient factory, with the first two being sold out of capacity. For example, at this point, we have sold out almost 100% of our capacity on four of the initial six packaging lines, and we are over 50% sold out on the remaining two initial lines in the combined Richmond, California and Conway, Arkansas plans. And as Chris will describe in a few moments, we're working on some new ways to keep the investing public current on our progress inside the plants when we roll out our guidance for 2024 early next year.  Now we do not expect most of this capacity in Conway to come online in commercial volumes, which is what produces EBITDA and until the very end of 2024 and early 2025. But we are confident that the four to five year forecasted EBITDA generation of Westrock, with these assets fully online remains right on track with our previous estimate at around $200 million of annual adjusted EBITDA. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for a review of our current operations and financial results. Chris Pledger : Thanks, Scott and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my remarks by providing an overview of our third quarter results and end with an update on our 2023 outlook and our outlook once our Conway extract and RTD facility is launched and operating at scale. Total company net sales for the third quarter were $219.6 million compared to $230.3 million for the third quarter of 2022. This 5% decrease was driven by a 25% decrease in net sales for our sustainable sourcing and traceability segment, partially offset by 2% growth in our Beverage Solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit, excluding the impact of $1.2 million of mark-to-market adjustment and the $1.8 million of out of carrier charges, Scott mentioned, was approximately $38 million for the quarter. The out-of-period charges impacted our Beverage Solutions segment and related to the recognition of green coffee costs, which were associated with coffee that was consumed and sold in a prior period. Consolidated gross profit for the third quarter of 2022 was $41.1 million, included $0.5 million of noncash mark-to-market loss. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.6 million compared to $17.9 million for the third quarter of 2022.  On a segment basis, our Beverage Solutions segment contributed $176.8 million of net sales for the third quarter of 2023, which represented year-over-year growth of 2%. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $9.9 million compared to $15.9 million for the prior year third quarter. Removing the impact of the $1.8 million of out-of-period charges, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter would have been approximately $12 million. While we're disappointed with our third quarter results, the underperformance versus the previous year was largely driven by consumer demand for roast and ground coffee in July and the first half of August. Like others in our space, demand for hot flat coffee in the third quarter was significantly down compared to the prior year, driven by higher gas and food prices and extremely hot temperatures across most of the U.S. On the positive side, we grew sales in our flavors, extracts and ingredients platform by approximately 70% year-over-year and our single-serve platform continues to see improvement driven by the pricing and operational improvement we highlighted on our last earnings call. Although we might not be excited about our third quarter results, we're very excited about the performance of our business and what that means for the future as roast and ground volumes normalize and our single-serve and extract platforms continue to grow.  Turning to our SS&T segment, sales net of intersegment revenues were $42.8 million during the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 25% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.7 million, which is $300,000 less than the prior year third quarter. You recall that net sales in our SS&T segment will fluctuate up and down based on the movement of the global price of Arabica coffee, and that our profit in this segment is largely based on the fixed dollar margin we make above that price. This is why you can have such a large downward swing in net sales versus the same quarter last year, while adjusted EBITDA is largely in line with what we generated versus same quarter last year. With respect to our capital expenditures, during the third quarter, we deployed approximately $56 million of CAPEX, primarily related to our Conway extract and RTD facility. And at quarter end, we had approximately $174 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments. Our consolidated net leverage ratio at September 30th, was 4.6 times based on LTM adjusted EBITDA.  Turning to our outlook for 2023, our performance in the third quarter undoubtedly impacts our expectations for full fiscal year 2023 adjusted EBITDA. While we expect roast and ground volumes to continue to improve through the end of the year, and we expect continued solid performance from both our single-serve and extracts platform, we do anticipate that fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA will fall below the previously provided guidance range. Our current expectation for full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $45 million to $50 million. We do, however, expect adjusted EBITDA to return to more normalized level in 2024. Now with respect to our extract and RTD facility, while it's impossible for us to accurately risk the timing of the EBITDA ramp we will experience as the facility begins production in the first half of 2024, we remain confident in our ability to deliver around $200 million of consolidated adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2027 as we continue on pace with the sales, contracting and product commercialization efforts required to deliver that number. We'll update you on all of this and more in our 2024 guidance call early in the new year. With that, I'll hand the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open. Jack Hardin : Hello. This is Jack Hardin on for Ben Bienvenu. With what you can see in the flavors and extracts market today, is the demand there subject to the same volatility that you've witnessed during the quarter in your roast and ground business? Scott Ford : That's a good question. I appreciate where you're coming from on it. It's actually a very different economic being, if you will. It's a different set of contracts, it's a very different type of product flow, it's a very different product forecast flow because it's a consumer product good that goes to a shelf directly versus people driving through and people trying to guess what they're going to do whether they buy coffee or just as part of the value mill or just buy a biscuit, etcetera, etcetera. And when gas prices go up, they tend to soften up on that pretty quickly. You can see across the industry that RTD, like every other beverage had a soft third quarter across the industry, but nothing like hot coffee itself experiences in terms of seasonal fluctuation or fluctuations around gas prices. It is a much more stable business, and it is a much more contractually driven business than the core roast and ground coffee business. Jack Hardin : Okay, great, thank you. And then one quick follow-up. How do you feel about the balance sheet at present and how has that view changed with throughout the quarter? Scott Ford : Well, it hasn't changed. We feel -- we've got plenty of room and frankly, if you look at where we're running and what we expect to run, taking July and August hot coffee out and this is a little complicated. But in a quarter where we made $17 million last year, we were close to $20 million this year without the two items I took you through. So as you roll through where we're running apart from those two months, from a credit perspective, we think we've got plenty of room. But I know for certain that if we ran into any issue whatsoever finishing out Conway, we have multiple sources lined up wanting to be part of this capital structure, to be part of this adventure, if you will because the Conway numbers are frankly stunning in terms of what they're going to add to this business and bridging it or financing it in any way, shape, form or fashion that is needed to finish that off. We're highly confident we can get that done. And as we said on our last call, this is the last common equity you're going to see us raise which we raised this last summer to finish. And we didn't know exactly how July and August were going to come in, but even that performance doesn't change that answer. Jack Hardin : Makes sense. Thank you so much. I will hop back in the queue. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will come from Todd Brooks of the Benchmark Company. Your line is open Todd. Todd Brooks : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Scott, I'd love to lead off with one for you, if I could. We're getting on four or five quarters as a public company here. Just as you're looking in the rearview, knowing that we've got Conway in front of us, just can you comment on kind of the lack of predictability that we've seen in the business over this time frame and what it takes to return to a more predictable nature in your kind of core roast and ground business and the non-FE&I portion of beverage solutions? Scott Ford : It's a totally fair question. First of all, you look at the performance of the business overall over the last year, and you've got essentially two things going on. You have in the single-serve business and in the systems integration, the first part of the year where we were putting in a new accounting and information system in Concord, which is the roast and ground and extract business. You had $5 million to $10 million of cost this year related to those two things, which are, for the most part, now out of the run rate. So you look at single-serve where we were basically overrun with orders beyond the equipment. We had to get equipment in. It was late bringing it in. We paid penalties, we suffered the charges of that. We ran 24/7 over time. All of that was in the first part of the year. In the last five months of the year, that business is right on plan, clicking along just like we told you.  So if you look at the extract business, flavors, extracts and ingredients and I'll heed your question and keep going, that, that business is up 70% over the quarter same period last year. So single serve is doing exactly what we told you it would do. Flavors extraction ingredients is doing exactly what we told you would do. The hot black coffee business is a very complicated business, where we had a very, very, very good year last year, and we've had a bit of a tough year this year, but you take out the demand forecast. Now these are the biggest companies in the world, biggest restaurant and C-store change. We follow their demand forecast. The gas price spike, the interest rate spike in the summer and the demand destruction that created at their restaurants and in their shelves surprised them as much as it surprised us. So I guess some points in time in hot black coffee, you're going to have periods of time like that. But if we hadn't had that happened to us, you'd be sitting here saying, well done, you're up 15% year-over-year. Tell me more about Conway. It's just like you just go through it. I've had quarters where we've been pleased and I'm no genius, and we've got quarters when we're disappointed, and we're not idiots. It's just part of a commodity processing business where you don't have contractual rights to make people buy product. Todd Brooks : That's great, Scott. And thanks for the candor. Chris, I was wondering if you could walk us through the bridge to the new EBITDA guidance kind of you laid out the $8 million shortfall in the quarter to plan. But at the midpoint of the range, we're talking more of a -- it looks like an incremental $8 million guide down to EBITDA expectations in 4Q, can we walk through what's behind that dip from the prior outlook? Chris Pledger : Yes, I think at the end of the day, I think you're starting to see more normalization, both in roast and ground and you're starting to see more normalization in single-serve and growth and extract. But if you go from kind of where you started, you're starting at a lower base. And so we expect continued growth in those platforms throughout the fourth quarter. But your -- that growth will flow underneath our expectation whenever we updated our guidance over the -- at the end of the second quarter call. Todd Brooks : Okay. Great. And the final one for maybe, Scott. On Conway, can you walk us through if there's been any change in the commercialization timing or the EBITDA extraction, I think on the last call, we talked about maybe an extraction that we extract 10% of the EBITDA opportunity that Conway eventually represents in fiscal 2024, are we still tracking towards being able to generate $20 million of EBITDA? Scott Ford : Here's where we are, and let's be super candid. In terms of the things that we have to do, is the equipment in, are the systems in, is the plumbing in, are the products ready to go, are people ready to go? All of that is on or ahead of schedule. Now we come into the period of time when the customer chooses how much they want to commercialize, how many SKUs they want to commercialize and when they want to do it, and they have to do that and they get to do that over a year. So there are no penalties in the year of start-up, and they select when they come in. So if they all come in, in the second quarter, we will blow that away. We will run through the roof on our -- against that kind of guidance. But if they all delay until late in the year or first part of 2025, which they contractually can then that won't happen in 2024. Now you're asking me what are my customers going to do in the commercialization, start-up selection that they alone control. I don't know, but they have a year to turn it up, which -- so it's very easy for me to tell you what we've got signed up for 2025. It's very difficult for me to tell you how that will phase in, in 2024. Todd Brooks : Okay, fair enough. I will jump back in queue. Thanks. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will come from Matt Smith of Stifel. Your line is open Matt. Matt Smith : Hi, good afternoon Scott and Chris. Thanks for taking my questions. If I could start with a question around hot coffee and I appreciate your commentary so far. But I'm surprised by the volatility in the business, especially the impact on EBITDA. Can you talk about the ordering patterns from your customers, do you have a sense of if they were carrying excess inventory into the quarter and that factored into why there was such a severe reduction here in the third quarter, perhaps there was a bit of inventory normalization to go along with the softness in the consumption that you saw? Scott Ford : Sure. I think let's take it into two parts. The first one is the variance in revenue and the impact on EBITDA. Well, that is in fact, in that part of our business where you really are a scaled core processing of commodity manufacturer, revenue ripple-through there is pronounced and direct as you would expect. When it comes to what we're going on with our customers, they were carrying inventory and the forecast they had for us caused us to build inventory. So at the end of the day, the whole system was full as we went into the summer and the summer was literally, we sold -- you may have to make an amended filing for this. But the whole miss was in hot coffee dollar for dollar from July and August. I mean it was stunning. And people said, as we've talked and getting ready for this quarter, I think a fair question is, well, why did you wait until the end of the quarter? Well, we're not Walmart. We don't report revenues on a monthly basis. But this quarter was in trouble in July. We didn't really realize how deeply we thought, well, that's some timing. But by the time August had closed when we were into September, we realized there is nothing you can do to save cost and get out of a commodity processing business quick enough when they just literally don't order anything. Matt Smith : I appreciate that. And then one of the hallmarks of the business was your long-tenured relationships with your customers. I think you had a number of your largest customers, you've been doing business with for many, many years. Have you seen any customer turnover there or is this really just related to consumption and inventory trends in the quarter? Scott Ford : This is 100% driven by the same set of customers doing less business year-over-year. Matt Smith : Okay. And then if I could transition over to talking about Conway. It's clear the opportunity there is compelling as we look out to 2027. You talked about $200 million for the full business. It sounded like that was your view of Westrock in 2027. Previously, you talked about $150 million to $175 million incremental EBITDA from the facility... Scott Ford : We said $125 million to $150 million on Conway. That's if you go back to last quarter and the previous, that was up from 100 when we went public. So we upped it from $100 million to $125 million to $150 million. Hard to know exactly how to fold in, but the number we're actually targeting is 200 plus or minus in 2027. And so those are the numbers, just go ahead and finish your question. I want to make sure we're on the same page there, though. Matt Smith : No, that's perfect. I appreciate that. And then one last one here. The contracts you have in place today, you've talked about you've sold out 100% and then 50% of the remaining lines that are being built out, understanding that there is some time line shift there based on when customers can decide to order. But can you talk about the structure of those contracts many co-manufacturers have a take-or-pay structure, are you trying to set that up with your customers or do they get to determine the volume as well as the timing? Scott Ford : Yes, some of them do and some of them don't, but for the most part, the large ones, where if someone comes in as an anchor tenant, they do. They do have a form of take-or-pay. Matt Smith : That\u2019s really helpful. I will leave it there and pass it on. Appreciate the help. Operator : And one moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Joseph Feldman : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm on for Sarang Vora today. A couple of follow-ups there. So we're sitting here today on November 9th and as you think about the fourth quarter, like, I guess what are you guys thinking about right now and what are you worried about, it seems like you kind of had a sense back on when you reported last quarter that this hot coffee was a pressure in July, but it really didn't come up and I'm just wondering what's not coming up right now or what should we be aware of that could be of concern for this fourth quarter and into next year? Scott Ford : Sure. Well, that's why we went on and gave you an update in our prepared remarks which we don't normally do, where we give you insight into the order book in October and November. So September, part of the third quarter, was back to 90% plus of the prior year. October was a write back at the prior year and November right now is running a little bit ahead. So we gave you that guidance so that you could see that as soon as gas prices came back down a little bit, people went back to their traditional buying patterns, and we lay over last year's results. We track it every day for the last several years, and we're laying right on top of previous years now. That could stop again if gasoline goes to $85 and Christmas spending comes on, there could be something like that, that we don't see right now. That's not coming through at the moment.  What we're doing in terms of the coffee business is this, we changed out the accounting and, if you will, management information systems. It's taken us many months to do that. We've actually just now started being able to get to some of the reports where the machines themselves are wired up so that we have all of the waste and throughput data off each machine. These are the things that we did in the single-serve plant last summer, which is why we know basically very early on in the month, what we're likely to make because we've got the algorithms down now by machine, by operator. We're putting all of that in the old S&D roast and ground business over the next few months. I expect that we'll see material improvement in the operating metrics of that facility once that system is finished. So that's the answer to your question. What are you worried about? Well, I'm worried about things I don't know about as always. And then what are you working on? We're rehanging the information system in roast and ground, the same way we did single serve, in the same way we are setting Conway up from the very beginning, so that we have that level of detail to manage the business going forward. Joseph Feldman : Got it, that's really helpful, thank you. And then just one more follow-up, I guess from a total sales perspective, you've talked about the EBITDA pressures in the fourth quarter. But any other puts and takes we should think about with regard to sales for this coming quarter and really even at the start of next year, we're hearing from a lot of other companies that they're concerned about slower demand, and I'm not quite sure that applies to coffee, but just wanted to get your thoughts on it? Chris Pledger : Well, we're not -- in terms of what we've seen so far in the fourth quarter, I think it's kind of a continuation of what we saw in September. So we're not seeing anything like that yet. I think you continue to have from an SS&T perspective, you're selling lower priced or you're selling coffee that comes in at a lower global commodity price. And so for SS&T, for example, you saw a significant decrease in the net sales of the business, but the EBITDA year-over-year is flat. And so you'll likely see significant decrease in net sales in SS&T coming into the fourth quarter, but you won't see -- but you'll continue to see EBITDA flat. You're not going to see EBITDA drop off because of that. But in our Beverage Solutions segment, I think you're going to continue to see the same kind of sales flow that you saw -- that we saw in September. Joseph Feldman : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it. Good luck with the quarter. Scott Ford : Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back to Scott Ford for closing remarks. Scott Ford : Well, thank you. I appreciate everybody hopping on this afternoon. I'd simply highlight what Chris and I had mentioned earlier, the third quarter was about a disappointing roast and ground coffee volume. Early in the quarter, we were pleased to see it come back. It continues to come back into the fourth quarter. That's as much visibility as we've got. So we're sharing it with you so that you can make your own assessment. We then look at the Conway facility coming online early next year. That is on time. I think it's important to remember this. We have filled out two extracted -- flavor, extract, and ingredient plant, one in Richmond, California that we bought a couple -- a year or so ago and the one in North Carolina they are full. We have more demand than we can make product for right now. Conway will not only package, but it will also manufacture extract to relieve that pressure. And the growth we've experienced there, which is up 70% year-over-year for the period, we're going to roll that same growth into Conway and the Conway facility alone, which is probably 70% contracted out right now, is capable of making twice the EBITDA of the entire enterprise on its own, and I expect it to do that. And we will be bringing you some metrics to follow along with us along the lines of percentage of completion, number of SKUs that are in commercialization, what kind of volumes that we've got, we'll try to give you some feel for that as we start the plant up so you can follow along and help do your own math, given really our lack of ability to forecast it because of the wide range of start-up window time that our customers have. And I'll just conclude by saying this, if they go to the end of their window, then we will make some more money next year than we made this year, and we will tough it out and rough it along. And if they come to the front of the window, it's very hard to get your mind around how fast the EBITDA of this business could explode to the upside. But nobody cares until we do it, we're on to that. We will get it done. Thank you for tuning in, and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We'll start on Slide 5. Last year, we celebrated West's 100th anniversary of groundbreaking health care innovation, which is one of many proud highlights shown on this recap slide. I also want to thank our team members who are connected by our strong responsibility and shared values that continue to help us succeed each day. Now turning to Slide 6, where I'll cover 3 main topics. First, we will examine the drivers of 2023. Second, we will discuss the challenges ahead in 2024. And third, we will talk about the drivers of growth that we'll return West to long-term financial construct of sales and margin expansion in 2025. Let's begin with our financial results. I am pleased with the strong base growth in 2023, which more than offset a decline of COVID-19-related sales of approximately $320 million. Excluding pandemic-related sales, we had strong base overall organic sales growth in the mid-teens. Driving this base growth is the expanding customer demand for our high-value product offerings, both components and devices, and for our contract manufacturing services. During the year, we made great strides with our capital expansion plans across our global network. For example, in Kinston, we expanded our footprint with new NovaPure capacity, and we're in the process of a significant expansion in our HVP processing capacity. At our Grand Rapids contract manufacturing site, we brought online new capacity for a customer's injection device in late 2022, which contributed to growth in 2023. We also have been able to successfully address our backlog of long lead times for certain products. This has been a challenge since the start of the pandemic, and thanks to the hard work of our teams through both optimization and capacity expansion, we have exited the year with normalized lead times. Moving to Slide 7. As we turn our attention to 2024, we are facing several challenges to our growth model as indicated in our preliminary outlook from October. With greater visibility of a changing market landscape, we expect 2% to 3% organic sales growth for the full year or about 5 to 6 percentage points lower than our preliminary outlook. This difference comes from 4 main factors. First, we had expected flat COVID-related sales this year, instead, demand continues to decline, which resulted in about 1% point decrease in organic sales. Second, timing of HVP device manufacturing capacity coming online to satisfy customer demand has been pushed out, causing a percentage point of headwind. Third, timing of a customer's upgrade to a higher HVP tier has caused a percentage point of headwind. And finally, fourth, a more widespread destocking is causing approximately 2 to 3 percentage points of headwind. Towards the end of the year and into January, the industry inventory management trend and other life science tools companies have been experiencing has now reached our segment of the injectable drug value chain. While we thought we might see some impact in 2024, we were surprised with the breadth, latitude and speed at which customers change their forecast. In several of these cases, customers express to us the same sentiment at the amount of forecast changes that were being handed to them. As we look to overall quarterly pacing for 2024, we expect that Q1 will have the largest negative impact due to destocking as well as timing of new HVP device capacity and customer-led HVP upgrade. We expect in Q1 that proprietary products will be down by high single decline. We expect some effect, but to a lesser degree in Q2 with positive proprietary products and consolidated organic growth. And we expect the second half of the year to have better growth with Q4 in line with our long-term financial construct. As we set our 2024 guidance and quarterly cadence, we see several areas that support our expectations. First, our February order book for the second half of the year has a higher coverage ratio than prior pre-pandemic levels. Second, we have some customers that are expected to be able to produce more drugs as the year progresses. Third, we expect HVP device capacity to improve in the second half of the year as we implement process modifications that were designed to improve manufacturing throughput. I am disappointed that we will not achieve our usual full year organic sales and margin expansion in 2024. As I've outlined, outside of further COVID demand reduction, some of the impact is time-related to new capacity and timing of customer upgrades. As for destocking, this is an industry-wide situation, not a change in market share or patient demand for drug volumes. Looking beyond 2024, we continue to be bullish on our growth construct and our teams will have another active year of capital investments in 2024. Moving to Slide 8. We will be expanding our industry-leading capacity with major HVP expansion projects in Jersey Shore and Eschweiler as well as other projects across the global network. Another driver of growth with a bright future comes from our HVP devices, which includes our injection delivery device platforms, Crystal Zenith containment solutions in the admin systems. HVP devices had very strong double-digit organic sales growth in 2023 and now represent 10% of overall sales. Less platforms are an integral part of our customers' drug device combination products that are making a difference to patients. And this year, we have had multiple capital expansion projects that will increase capacity for SmartDose, SelfDose and admin systems, with some expected to come online in the second half of 2024 and fully online in 2025. As mentioned at the outset, contract manufacturing had growth contribution from new capacity at our Grand Rapids site to support our customer's injection device platform. Looking ahead, we're excited to have started a significant expansion at our Dublin facility, which is already dedicated to contracted demand for future injection device manufacturing. We expect to be completed and validated in 2024, which places us in a great position for 2025 growth. I also want to take some time to talk about the dynamics of future demand related to our growth drivers for HVP components. As you know, we have been building HVP capacity for several years and expect it to continue to do so in 2024. We see a robust runway of volume growth over the next few years. As a foundation, we expect volume growth of existing drugs with increasing ageing patient populations, expanding geographical reach and evolving treatment guidelines and market conditions. In addition to overall volume growth, we continue to experience and see certain drugs have breakthrough growth. For example, we are experiencing a similar surge in demand for components associated with drugs treating diabetes and obesity. Our responsibility as the industry leader in primary packaging is to be prepared for incremental jumps in demand. And lastly, the area with the most potential for our future growth is our HVP capacity to support and mix shift. For mix shift, we see a combination of volume from new drugs that enter the market and from legacy drugs that upgrade from either a standard component or lower to a higher HVP category. The mix shift of legacy to HVP has historically been a smaller contributor for us compared to contribution from newly approved drugs. However, with the industry landscape changing, regulators are introducing new regulations for higher quality, lower particulate, and more standardized solutions. And therefore, customers are looking to upgrade their standard primary components. When we look at that over the next few years, we estimate that several billions of our primary containment components in standard form could benefit from a mix shift to our modern formulation and HVP processes. We recognize this mix shift will take time, but we anticipate as new regulation changes are enforced. This adoption will accelerate. By considering our combination of growth drivers from volume, price and HVP mix shift, we can confidently assert that we will be well equipped to navigate the challenges and continue to fuel our long-range financial construct of 7% to 9% annual organic sales growth and at least 100 basis points of operating margin expansion per year. Now I'll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2023 revenues and profits, where we saw low single-digit organic sales growth and an increase in diluted EPS and operating profit. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will review our 2024 guidance. First up Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 21. We recorded net sales of $732 million in the quarter, representing organic sales growth of 1.4%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $7 million in the quarter and approximately $48 million reduction compared to the prior year. Looking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products organic net sales declined by 0.3% in the quarter. As we anticipated, in addition to the COVID decline, we continue to experience a destocking of inventory by certain of our customers during the fourth quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 75% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, generated low single-digit growth, led by customer demand for HVP components and devices. Looking at the performance of the market units, the pharma market unit had low single-digit growth led by demand for Daikyo and NovaPure components, partially offset by a reduction in sales related to COVID. The biologics and generics market units experienced low single-digit and mid-single-digit declines respectively, due to a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine. Our Contract Manufacturing segment showed high single-digit net sales growth, led by an increase in sales of medical device and diagnostic products. We recorded $278.2 million in gross profit, which was $16.1 million or 6.1% higher than Q4 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 38% was a 100 basis point increase from the same period last year. Our adjusted operating profit increased to $159.9 million this quarter compared to $158.7 million in the same period last year. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 21.8% was a 60 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS rose 3.4% for Q4. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.01 in Q4, EPS increased by approximately 6.4%. Now let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $39 million or 5.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter as did a foreign currency tailwind of approximately $18.5 million. Offsetting price was a negative mix impact of $29.3 million, primarily due to a reduction in COVID-19 related net demand of $48 million and destocking trends in the sector by certain of our customers. Looking at margin performance on Slide 12. Proprietary products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 42.7% is 110 basis points higher than the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The key driver for the increase in proprietary products gross profit margin related to sales price increases, offset by inflationary pressures at our plants and mix from the reduction in COVID revenues. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% was 250 basis points greater than the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in margin can be attributed to sales price increases and a favorable mix of products sold. And let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $776.5 million for the year, an increase of $52.5 million compared to the same period last year a 7.3% increase. Operating cash flow in the period primarily benefited from favorable working capital management. In 2023, we spent $362 million on capital expenditures, a 27.2% increase over 2022. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity and/or contract manufacturing capacity. Working capital of approximately $1.26 billion decreased by $135.9 million from 2022, primarily due to an increase in our current portion of long-term debt and reduction in our cash balance. Our cash balance at December 31, $853.9 million was $40.4 million, lower than our December 2022 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to increased CapEx and share repurchases, offset by our working capital management. Turning to guidance. Slide 7 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2024 net sales guidance will be in a range of $3 billion to $3.025 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $8 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 2% to 3%. We expect our full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.50 to $7.75, also, our CapEx guidance is $350 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 14, our proven growth strategy continues to deliver unique value, the breadth of our high-quality product offerings. This is evidenced by a robust committed order book. Despite the headwinds and challenges in the sector, our team is committed to overcome these obstacles to meet the anticipated growth expectations. I'm confident and excited about the future for West as we continue to make a difference to patient health across the globe. Latif, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Windley of Jefferies. Your question please, David. David Windley : I'm going to start with an easier one and then a higher level one. So Eric, I appreciate the comments that you gave us around the cadence of recovery or reacceleration in '24. So if I understood you correctly, you said negative double digits in proprietary products. Because one of you talked to where you think overall growth, like where will organic sales growth be in 1Q all in? And then how does that ramp through to the fourth quarter? It sounds like it gets to what you would call normal in the fourth quarter. Just want to understand that more precisely. Thank you. Eric Green : Yes, Dave, I just want to make one correction. I'm hopeful just to be clear. The proprietary products anticipated performance in Q1 is high single-digit decline, just to be clear. And I would say majority of that the change in our view has come from destocking. While I mentioned 2 other factors, majority is destocking, and it's specifically 75% of the destockings coming from 6 customers. So I just want to kind of give you a little color around that aspect. Bernard, do you want to cover? Bernard Birkett : Yes. On a consolidated basis, we would see the growth between 6% to 7% or negative 6% to 7% decline in Q1. And then as we said, we would expect to see growth ramping as we move through the year and getting back to construct in Q4. David Windley : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then a little more conceptually, Eric, you said in your comments, you were emphatic about not a change in market share, not a change in patient demand. You also, though, later said that in your interactions with clients about the breadth, magnitude and speed of the changes in their forecasts. I guess I would be curious from what you draw the confidence that it's not a change in patient demand if those customers are changing their own forecast. So I want to understand that. And then in this destocking, is the destocking still more in lower value, either low end of high-value or bulk standard products, or are you now dealing with destocking kind of up and down the product portfolio? Thank you. Eric Green : Yes, David. So first of all, when we have our conversations with customers, it's a combination of two factors. One is, as they look at their inventory levels, they see an opportunity to leverage a little more working capital management. In addition to that, you add on the factor that in the beginning of 2023 and in all of 2022, our lead times, we were significantly higher, probably 3x to 4x. And what we've been able to do successfully due to both optimization and capital deployment that now is online and keeping up with the demand. We were able to bring those lead times to well before pre-pandemic levels. And so therefore, if you add those two factors together, it gave them confidence to be able to be more aggressive on inventory management. From a destocking, look at our portfolio, you're right. One of the areas that was more pronounced was on the standard in bulk areas, but we're also seeing it in some cases in parts of our HVP portfolio. So it is -- I would say, it's a cross, a broader set, but I would say the primary area has been the bulk and of the standard area. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. On the $250 million of CapEx this year, and then I think it was a little higher last year. When does this, like, for example, last year's CapEx, when does this translate into revenue? Is it what you're alluding to earlier, is it second half '24? Eric Green : Yes. Paul, thanks. So last year, we did approximately $362 million of capital. This year, we're forecasting about $350 million. And I would say still that same algorithm about approximately 70% is growth and 30% is maintenance just to give you that kind of context. When we look at the type of capital we're putting in, on the HVP capacity, what we're seeing is a transition. So we got NovaPure completed last year. And now we're in HVP finishing processing, which is important for the broader portfolio. And so that will be in line in 2024 and really some benefit in '24, but really '25 and beyond. The other area I should just be clear on, it's called about roughly a third of our capital, growth capital is going into our contract manufacturing business. We kind of highlighted that we've expanded Grand Rapids already that is up and running and fully utilized. We have a major project underway in Dublin that will be validated at the end of 2024. This is a significant facility, 175,000 square feet that has demand already committed. So we're pretty confident to get that up and running the end of the year and producing product for all of 2025. So it will be a good return in a short period of time. Those are the two probably bigger projects that are going on. But yes, it's more near term than long term. Paul Knight : I guess my follow-up and last question would be, you've guided to a long-term growth rate of 7% to 9%, yet in the same period of the last couple of years or so, GLP-1s have emerged as a significant class of therapeutic. Does that square up with your historical guidance of 7% to 9% with this GLP-1 demand out there? Eric Green : Well, Paul, that is an area that we've always talked about is that we do feel that could be an incremental upside as that market evolves. I do feel very confident. We feel very confident that we are participating quite well with our customers that are in that space, not just in our proprietary products as you think about the different formats, whether it's an auto-injector or a pen with multiple uses, so cartridges and prefilled syringes. So we do participate in the proprietary side, but we're also participating on the contract manufacturing side, which is kind of driving some of these large investments that we're making today. So we see that as upside to our long-term construct because we would consider that more of a breakout drug, a similar kind of effect that we had during the COVID time period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson of Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Maybe, Eric, just first following up on that last comment about contract manufacturing. That's a business maybe we don't have the most visibility into in terms of the future growth outlook. But clearly, you're deploying capital into that segment right now. So should we think about that business growing kind of above its historical range for the next couple of years, or how should we think about their term profile on these investments and capacity you're making there? Eric Green : Yes. Bernard, would you like to take that one, please? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So we would expect contract manufacturing to be grown within our construct. The investments that we're making in that area are very specific and tied to specific customers and business. And as Eric said, before we make the investments, we have a level of visibility as this type of commitment we're going to get and that does support the long-term growth of that business and ties in with our construct. Now again, we always say if we can do more and there's opportunity to do more, we will. And what we feel at this point, it is important to make these investments. Jacob Johnson : Got it. And then just on the destocking and kind of visibility to this subsiding as we maybe get into the back half of the year. I know your portfolio is a bit different than the bioprocessing peers, but it took a while before we kind of found the bottom of destocking before really kind of numbers bottomed and kind of accelerated last year maybe there's some unique dynamics around that. And I think investors and some of us have [indiscernible] from this. Can you just talk about your visibility into that destocking concluding and maybe kind of the order book, how firm the order book is the back half of this year? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So Jacob, just on the order book, when we look at the order book for the back half of the year and compare where we are today versus where we were pre-COVID. The order book actually looks stronger, and so we're a bit ahead of where we thought we would be on that compared to pre-COVID trends and rates. So that's giving us a level of confidence in the back half and seeing that I won't say a rebound, but the acceleration trending back to our normal construct growth rates. And so that based on that analysis, we don't see it as being a long-term problem. We would expect we get through it this year and as we said in the back half trending towards into that construct, particularly in Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : So can we talk a little bit about the margin cadence and just how to think about this and obviously, you're suffering from some headwinds from Kinston not being fully utilized. It sounds like you're taking some headwind from proprietary products. How should we think about the margin impact and exiting 2024, I mean, assuming that this doesn't linger to the last analyst question that this doesn't linger in you, do have some visibility in back half of the year. Are we back at a more normalized margin rate exiting the year? Bernard Birkett : Yes. Derik, that's what we would expect to see. Q1, obviously, is going to be pressured from a margin point of view based on what we're seeing from a revenue perspective, if we see a high correlation there. But again, we do see it trending back to more normal rates of operating margin as we progress through the year and it will be a gradual shift, I think, quarter-over-quarter. Derik De Bruin : Got it. But just more on the -- just sort of any help, that's fine. I'll do that. And then can we talk about pricing? I mean, you've enjoyed better-than-expected pricing for the last couple of years? Is that sustainable, or are you getting pushback from customers? Eric Green : Yes, Derik. I mean, I know last year, we were between 5% to 6% as we guided the year before. I think we're between 3% and 4%. Before that, as you know, the history of this company, we're probably 1% or 2%. We're not returning back to the history levels. So we're probably more near the 3-plus mark from a net price contribution. And just to be clear, any mix shift that occurs, we do not classify that as price. So this is pure price net price contribution. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And I appreciate the commentary on the 75% of this is tied to 6 customers. I mean, your level of confidence that you can get sort of like the pickup in 2Q that you're seeing and going forward? I mean just like is there a chance that this gets moved out again that there is not going to take stuff, I mean, since you were surprised as last time. I mean, you're a little bit more limited and say what the bioprocessing vendors are going through just given the breadth of the CDMOs and things are there. So can you just sort of like what are your conversations with these people, your level of confidence? I mean do you get surprised again? Eric Green : Yes. It's absolutely a continued focus for us, Derik, absolutely. I mean, we're not pleased with the impact it's had on us. We pride ourselves we have pretty much access to a large part of the market. And however, based on the conversations and the data we've been looking at with our customers, there will be some still in Q2 that has some destocking, but not as pronounced in Q1. So it's really, most of it that we're seeing is really a Q1 phenomenon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Larew of William Blair. Matt Larew : Asking about the order book here. I think one thing we saw on the bioprocessing side is at some point during that saga, company started referencing green shoots or early indicators of ordering demand and then just took longer for some of those orders to convert or for sort of the green shoots to turn into a dollar signs. So just understanding that the order book is outpacing pre-pandemic levels, good coverage. What sort of the level of confidence, whether that's written contractually or something else that sort of order activity today will convert to revenue dollars in the P&L as you see them coming in. Bernard Birkett : Yes. Once the orders are confirmed at this stage, we've pressure tested a lot of that. So we have a good level of confidence that they will convert into revenues in that period. So I think we've done a lot of pressure testing here over the last month or 2 to make sure that that is the case. So that will be our expectation and that's what we're basing our level of confidence on. Again, the order book will continue to build as we move through the year, but as I said, we are ahead of where we were pre-pandemic. Matt Larew : Okay. And then another piece of this was, I think you said 1% from HVP manufacturing capacity. And I think if we dial back to Kinston and bringing some of that capacity online, obviously, you end up catching up a little quicker than you initially thought. What sort of the scope of this capacity expansion and sort of the past year to get it back to where you want to be? Eric Green : Yes. So specifically on what percent down is new lines, also automation or putting it into our HVP devices. These are the proprietary devices that we've manufactured like SelfDose and SmartDose for our customers, and these are combination devices approved with a specific drug molecule with our customers. So when you think about that specific area that's ongoing right now of expansion, additional capacity brought in the demand is there in hand and we need to be able to get caught up to build to support our customers. And so that is on us to make sure that we execute and get that up and running in 2024 validated. We expect that to actually commercial revenues in the second half of 2024 for those specific products. From a components perspective, Kinston and other sites, our lead times are very good, and that was more of last year, getting them validated and up and running. The HVP processing that we referenced about this year that we'll have further completion and validation. That has really help us support customers as they do a mix shift to the higher end of HVP and also future drug launches that could have larger volumes than we anticipated due to kind of what we call breakout drugs, right, certain categories. So we're positioning ourselves well to be able to support that growth that we anticipate coming in the near future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Sourbeer of UBS. John Sourbeer : Maybe just dialing in on the HVPs there on the last question. I think they were around 75% of mix in 4Q. I mean, is that the right level to think about for 2024, or are there dynamics in play that could make shift up, or down with the destocking and the new capacity for the year? Bernard Birkett : John, it's relatively the same percentage plus or minus because the destocking is kind of across broad categories. And when we look at growth in our business, particularly in the proprietary, it is led by the high-value products in the component side. That is leading to growth. As you know that we are in a very attractive injectable market and one of the best the fastest-growing subsegment within the injectable space is biologics. Our participation rate remains very high, continues to be so. And that's where a lot of the HVP growth is occurring which is causing a mix shift on the margin. So we anticipate that to be still robust percentage of our overall portfolio. John Sourbeer : Appreciate that. And then I guess, specific to the destocking trends in the various proprietary product segments, I think pharma and generic saw this impact first and then now it's more broad in the biologics. Do you expect the pharma side to recover faster followed by biologics, or just any additional details on a segment perspective. Eric Green : Yes. That's good questions. You're absolutely spot on. But when we look at the destocking effect that's happened for us in the first half of this year, it is across multiple market segments. So it's both, it's not just the generics and pharma, but also in some cases, in the biologics. So I would say that for us and where we are in the value chain, is pretty much across all 3 sectors, we talk about biologics, pharma and generics. John Sourbeer : I guess just on the recovery there, do you expect them all to come back similarly, or is one you see the big green shoots more impacting one segment versus another? Bernard Birkett : Very similar of all three, very similar staging coming back. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers of Deutsche Bank. Justin Bowers : So I have a 2-parter here. But first, I wanted to clarify the cadence in the prepared remarks. I thought I heard products would be positive in 2Q and overall would be positive. So I just wanted to clarify that. And then sort of the step-up from 2Q to 3Q on growth? And then, the follow-up question would be just on the order book. You said it has a higher coverage ratio than pre-pandemic levels. Can you just help, is that sort of like a forward 12-month or forward 6 months, or just how do you guys look at it internally and across which businesses? Help us understand what that. Bernard Birkett : Answering your first question, yes, we would expect proprietary to return to positive growth in Q2. As we said, it's going to step up over the years, so we're not going to see a huge spike anomaly. So again, there's still a level of destocking. So probably low single-digit growth in proprietary. And then on a consolidated basis, also, we would see returning to growth in Q2. And then looking at the order book, we're really looking at on a 12-month basis. So rolling 12 months. Justin Bowers : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just to clarify on the margins, too. I'm getting to, it looks like if I sort of back into the EPS guide, with a normalized tax rate, I'm still getting to roughly 90 to 100 basis points of margin expansion on the low end. Is that the right math, or is there some other dynamics in play there that I'm missing here? Bernard Birkett : For the year? Justin Bowers : Yes. Bernard Birkett : No, we would expect operating margin to be flat year-over-year, yes. Operator : Our next comes from the line of David Windley of Jefferies. David Windley : Around the horn here. I wanted to ask a couple of follow-ups. Eric, just to clarify for the broader audience. When you talk about participation rate, I interpret that to mean that you're expecting on the product. You and I have talked about how on big customer, big important products West likes to be in a position of a sole-source position. Can you help us to translate or translate between participation and share. Eric Green : Yes. When we say participation rate is that when we are our customers when they file their regulatory filings, it is pointing towards the West product. that's in their filings. And therefore, we tend to have a pretty, let's say, share, it's usually a very large percentage of that, if not all. Do customers in the market look at a secondary source and/or test for that secondary source, yes. But when we look at our participation rate, it tends to be a pretty large share of the volume of the doses basically. So that's what we mean by participation. It's a win rate for us, Dave. And it's pretty consistent historically, and we've been tracking that. For both ourselves, and our partners, Daikyo at the molecule level, absolutely. David Windley : Got it. And then you've talked about, your market share is 70%. That's not a number that really has changed in a very long time, maybe even higher than that. You've talked about participation biologics being 90% or better. Just elephant in the room, I suppose in a competitor's conference call recently talked about a project that they have been included on of a recently launched large molecule, sounds GLP-1, sounds very significant and sounds a little bit like a market share take. I gather that your prepared remarks, we're kind of addressing that, but I just want to throw it out there and ask for more specificity about your participation rate in GLP-1s. Eric Green : Yes. No, our participation rate in GLP-1 is very strong. And there might be other components that are used in the final packaging configuration that are provided by someone else in the market that's been historically true. But the way we are positioned with our customers in that particular space is very strong on proprietary components but also on the contract manufacturing side. So I would say that in all cases, when you look at a final primary packaging containment, there's multiple elements that go into it. Hence, the reason why we're driving towards more of an integrated system approach as we've been talking about building towards. We would like to have more components than just 1 or 2 items on that whole system. So yes, others will probably be participate with their own products, but I'm pretty -- I feel really comfortable where we are with our position. David Windley : Got it. And then, last question for me. From a capital allocation standpoint, maybe a two-parter, I apologize. You've talked about CapEx. You've talked about a lot of that being growth that CapEx number continues to be relatively high in 2024. I guess I want to kind of understand to what extent you're catching up on capacity. You've talked about long lead times, you talked about demand and hand things like that, or is there a risk of some mismatch of capacity as you're spending still aggressively on CapEx? And then, in terms of alternative uses of free cash flow, stock is going to get dislocated on this news. You bought back stock in 2023. How aggressively might management want to step in and buy back stock as a sign of confidence in the long-term growth outlook. Thank you. Eric Green : Dave, let me address the first part and then maybe I'll turn it over to Bernard on the second part. When I look at the capital that we have in front of us today for 2024, the $350 million. It is true that we would like to be able to get our capital as a percentage of sales back to the high single-digit range. However, while 70-plus percent of our capital is still around growth. These are commitments that our customers were working with, whether it's near term or more midterm, that we need to build support. So in the contract manufacturing side, it's very clear, it's very near term. These are contracts we have agreed upon for a number of years ahead of us that we need to get the installed capacity in place immediately so we can start producing product for them. On the proprietary side, we are anticipating future growth with new drug launches that are occurring and will occur and based on the volumes that we've been asked to be able to support, these are the types of investments we need to make. So, for example, HVP processing is not just a NovaPure play, but it's the ability to take our HVP portfolio and support the growth not just on the volume, but also new drug launches, any particular categories that are going to have outsized growth rates. And then also on this mix shift effect that is on us today due to regulatory changes requiring higher quality, lower particulates to meet these regulations that are going in place. So those are the drivers why we feel good, confident about the investments we're making because we know the return on these investments are very positive for us and obviously for our customers. And that's the lens that we currently have. Do you want to, Bernard, touch on the capital? Bernard Birkett : Yes. Dave, I think it's important for us to deploy CapEx in this way, it takes time for us to layer in capacity. It takes 12 to 24 months. And so based on just back to Eric's comments, what we're seeing from a demand perspective, we need to layer that in at this time. So we don't actually run into long lead times like we experienced in COVID and then it's difficult to respond to growth in the market and not capture all the opportunities. So that's thinking behind layering in this capacity. And again, it's around very specific areas. And we do expect our CapEx to kind of level off here possibly after 2024 because we have a lot of the investment on. And again, it's a very deliberate and disciplined approach to capital deployment. We review it on a regular basis. And based on all the analysis we have feedback or input from our customers, but we need to continue deploying as we've outlined in 2024 to be prepped for the next number of years. Was there another part of that question? David Windley : Share repurchase? Bernard Birkett : Yes. On the buyback, again, we have a very deliberate process as to how we deploy the buyback. And we review that on a quarterly basis to see where we are, and we will continue to do that. and to deploy it where and when appropriate. Quintin Lai : We have time for just one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Larry Solow of CJS Securities. Larry Solow : There it is. Thank you. Long wait there, worth the wait. I guess just a couple, first of all, Eric, thank you for a really good description of sort of not a great subject, but the impact of the lower sales outlook, really appreciate that. I guess kind of just switching gears to a couple of topics. Can you just give us a little more follow-up on, a little more color just on the -- you mentioned an ongoing sort of regulatory shift. Has this accelerated in terms of requirements for low particulate. And is that something that's going to drive some of the legacy products to have to switch maybe over, or is that just driving more on new products coming to the market? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, it's a good question, thanks for that, and thanks for your patience. Larry Solow : Absolutely. Eric Green : No, absolutely. So there's a regulatory shift that's occurring called Annex 1, really being driven out of Europe, but it's going to obviously be a driver for a lot of the multinationals because of the requirements across the globe. And what that means is that we have a pretty large part of our portfolio. We mentioned in the neighbor of billions of components we produce each year that when we classify a standard that would be required to move up what we classify as high-value product portfolio to be able to service some higher quality lower particulates to meet these regulations. Now when you look at our HVP mix shift historically, we talked about it for a number of years. The success of that mix shift of West for the last several years has been on really new molecules, particularly in the biologics as more volume and demand goes in that particular segment, it's higher ASP, higher margin. And we've been seeing that benefit at West for a number of years. What we're seeing going forward that continue to because of our because of the participation rate that we have with these new launches. We also now, because the regulatory changes are being enforced and policies are being changed it will require a mix shift effect of existing drugs in the market. So that's a great opportunity for us to work with our customers were necessary to be able to transition them into a more appropriate packaging configuration that allows them to meet or exceed all the standards. So we're quite excited about this opportunity. We look at some of the investments that we need to make [indiscernible] support it, particularly on the HVP processing. We're very much aligned to where the market is going. And if I would just share one more comment, historically here at West, when we introduced new products or capabilities particularly on our last [Indiscernible] components, it's usually coincide with the regulatory change. So as the regulations have evolved over time, our portfolio has evolved with and exceeded those requirements, which has always put us in a good position. They'll support our customers and ultimately their patients. So I'm feeling good about this that we're ready to be able to address this this item, but it will take several years. It's not a 1-year event or a 2-year event. It does take several years, but we're ready to go on that. Larry Solow : It sounds like it's a layer in some extra growth on an annual basis if it comes to fruition over a multiple year period. But if I could squeak one more in, just on the devices and reaching 10% of proprietary high-value price sales. I think that's a nice significant milestone. Is that driven more by SmartDose, SelfDose, is that the combination of two, what's really driving that growth going forward? Eric Green : It's interesting. It's actually through all of them, but the biggest drivers have been last year, and we're actually quite excited. Our administration systems, our admin systems continues to grow well. We just relaunched a new version of our [indiscernible] 2-millimeter, which partners real well to 20-millimeter into the hospital health care market. In the SelfDose, we're seeing a nice uptick demand in that category with discrete customers and their drug launches. And then, in SmartDose is an area that we've been focused on for a number of years, but we're at a point now of inflection on volume growth that we have to get ahead of the curve. And that is an area that we're laser focused on right now. We have a dedicated team with new automated equipment coming online so we can remove the manual processes, allows us to be more efficient, higher volume, higher quality to be able to support the growth of these launches. So it is kind of across multiple areas, and it's exciting to see it starting to gain traction. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Quintin Lai for closing remarks.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference may be recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Quintin Lai : Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to West's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We issued our financial results this morning and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. This morning, we will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present an updated financial outlook for the full year 2024. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website. On Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities law. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts. The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. Actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made here. Please refer to today's press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risks to which it is subject, including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5, where I'd like to cover a few topics. First, we will review Q1 performance. Second, we will provide an update on the markets that we serve as well as updates on our growth initiatives. And third, we will provide an update to our full year 2024 financial outlook. Now turning to the financial results. We delivered a solid start to the year. During the quarter, we again saw growth in our top-tier HVP component, NovaPure, and our HVP devices such as SmartDose. We also continued to see inventory management or destocking by our larger mature customers that are working down their inventory closer to pre-pandemic levels. With that said, Q1 had a solid start due to favorable order timing of customer deliveries fulfilled in the quarter. I want to address the question that many of you are asking, are we seeing an inflection in destocking? The short answer is not quite yet. Several customers are still working through their safety stock levels, and we still expect Q2 to have an impact from customer destocking and customer order trends continue to indicate a stronger second half of 2024 with a return to more typical order patterns in Q4. Therefore, after a solid quarter, we maintain our full year net sales guidance. Turning to Slide 6. We continue to have an active year of capital expansion projects that are increasing capacity to meet growing demand for both our Proprietary Products and Contract Manufacturing segments. In our Proprietary Products segment, we have expansion projects in several of our HVP components manufacturing sites, such as Jersey Shore, Kinston, Waterford and Eschweiler. These projects will provide a combination of increased manufacturing capacity, especially HVP processing, washing, sterilization and Envision as well as bring a higher level of global standardization throughout our network. We believe that this favorably positions West to address anticipated growing demand for HVP components from volume growth of legacy drugs, from recently launched or to-be-launched drugs and potential conversions from legacy customers to higher levels of quality in response to the global regulatory changes. Last quarter, we mentioned one such regulatory change was the European Union GMP Annex 1. We continue to emphasize that adoption. Both timing and level of HVP will vary from customer to customer and from drug to drug. What we are seeing in Q1 is an acceleration of interest from customers as Annex 1 calls for higher quality, lower particulate and more stabilized solutions. Earlier this month at the INTERPHEX conference in New York, Annex 1 was a key topic of discussion with customers as we highlighted our innovative approach and leading products of Westar Select and NovaPure. Also, in the Proprietary Products segment, we're making progress with capacity expansion of our HVP devices including SmartDose, SelfDose and admin systems. For the near term, we're working to layer in capacity through productivity optimization programs. And for the longer term, we are adding capacity that incorporates automation to complement our manual processes. With our Contract Manufacturing, we continue to build out capacity at our Grand Rapids site and significant expansion at our Dublin facility, which are both in support of our customer's injection device platform. These expansions are critical to the overall volume growth that we continue to experience with growing demand for certain components associated with drugs for diabetes and obesity. Shifting to Slide 7. We're maintaining our full year 2024 organic sales growth outlook of 2% to 3%. Our teams are actively engaged in working through our customers' inventory management. We expect improved growth along with stronger gross and operating margins in the second half of the year, with Q4 projected to be the strongest quarter. For the full year, we are maintaining general core cost discipline while reinvesting into new growth initiatives, as I have just outlined. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2024 revenues and profits where, as expected, we saw a low single-digit decrease in organic sales, a decline in operating profit and diluted EPS compared to the first quarter 2023, given the current market dynamics. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2024 guidance. First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 18. We recorded net sales of $695.4 million, representing an organic sales decline of 3%. Looking at Slide 9. Proprietary Products organic net sales decreased 4% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up 72% of Proprietary Products sales in the quarter, declined by low single digits primarily due to decreased sales from our FluroTec products and Westar components. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered low single-digit growth, led primarily by sales of NovaPure. The pharma market unit saw a high single-digit decline, primarily due to a reduction in sales of Envision and standard components, while the generics market unit declined double digits, primarily due to decreased sales from our Westar and FluroTec components. Our Contract Manufacturing segment experienced low single-digit net sales growth in the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in sales of components associated with diagnostic devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin, 17.7%, was a 530 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 21.2% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit, EPS decreased by approximately 23%. Now let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 10, we show the contribution to organic sales decline in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $24.1 million, a 3.4 percentage points of growth in the quarter, as did a foreign currency tailwind of approximately $3.4 million. More than offsetting price was a negative volume and mix impact of $45.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume caused by customer inventory management decisions in the period. Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 33.1% of Q1 2024, down from 37.9% in Q1 2023. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 37% was 550 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2023. The key drivers for the decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were lower sales volume and an unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by increased sales prices. Contract Manufacturing first quarter gross profit margin of 17% was 60 basis points below the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to inflationary labor costs and an unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by increased sales prices. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $118.2 million for the 3 months ended March 2024, a decrease of $19.9 million compared to the same period last year, a 14.4% decrease primarily due to a decline in operating results. Our first quarter 2024 year-to-date capital spending was $90.6 million, $8.5 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase both our high-value products and our Contract Manufacturing capacity. Working capital of approximately $1.04 billion at March 31, 2024, decreased by $220.1 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a reduction in our cash balance. Our cash balance at March 31, 2024 was $601.8 million, which was $252.1 million lower than our December 2023 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to $267 million of share repurchases and our capital expenditures offset by cash from operations. Turning to guidance. Slide 7 provides a high-level summary. We are reaffirming our full year 2024 net sales guidance in the range of $3 billion to $3.025 billion. There is an estimated full year 2024 headwind of approximately $8 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 2% to 3%, unchanged from prior guidance. We are raising our full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.63 to $7.88, compared to a prior range of $7.50 to $7.75. Also, our CapEx guidance of $350 million for the year, unchanged from prior guidance. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an estimated FX headwind of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rate, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $0.02. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.15 associated with first quarter 2024 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize with Slide 13, the solid financial performance and execution in Q1 continues to reaffirm our proven growth strategy, strong base business and the unique value of our high-quality product offerings for customers. We look forward to building on this momentum as we move through the year, and our team is steadfast in meeting the anticipated growth expectations as we make a positive impact on health care across the globe. Olivia, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Matthew Larew with William Blair. Matthew Larew : I wanted to ask about -- you referenced the pickup in the back half of the year, but more about the second quarter. Last call, you discussed sort of a flip to positive growth in the second quarter. And Eric, in your comments, it sounds like there hasn't been an inflection on the destocking. So just wondering if we should still be thinking about positive organic growth in the second quarter or if things are now more weighted to the back half of the year? Eric Green : Matt, thanks for the question. What we're seeing is that Q2 will be sequentially stronger than Q1 but we also see that as we go into Q3 and Q4 throughout the year. We did see some demand in the first half of this year that we were able to build and fulfill through our manufacturing sites in Q1 that I would consider as timing in the first half of this year. But the buildup will be sequential quarter-over-quarter over the next 4 quarters. Bernard, do you want to add any more? Bernard Birkett : Yes. Just as Eric said, Matt, sequentially, it will be up. There is an element of timing between Q1 and Q2. So some of those orders that we shipped out in Q1, originally, we would have earmarked in Q2. So we're seeing that, and we're also seeing the destocking continue into Q2. Matthew Larew : Okay. Then maybe let me go from very near term to a higher level, which is that some peers have described that the supply chain disruptions and longer lead times during the pandemic created an opportunity for them perhaps to get into West's customers where they didn't have access to before. And so just curious what your assessment is of your competitive positioning and perhaps more generally, the industry's bias towards sole source or multisource arrangements moving forward and just kind of ask that in light of all the high-value capacity you're adding. Eric Green : Yes, Matt, over the pandemic, we actually worked with our customers to make sure that we were able to continue to supply and that there wasn't any stockout with any particular customer. So we were successful through the pandemic period of time. And we have been working on reducing the backlog and increasing their safety stock levels really in back end of 2022 and 2023. The way we see it is that we continue to be on the molecules that are in the marketplace. We are working with them as they adjust their schedules for future shipments to be able to continue to supply those products in the market, and it is based on number of scripts that are being -- injections being administered. But also, more importantly, is if we look at our current win rate or participation rate last year and going into this year, it is as strong as it's ever been. So our interactions with our customers remain very strong. We have a very strong position in the marketplace. And the issue around potential sole source is that what customers have gained confidence is that we have multiple sites that can be able to support their product in the marketplace so they're not dependent on a particular site. And in that sense, we're able to provide them with a single product, multiple sites to be able to support their global supply chain. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Maybe just on the quarter, if I look at revenue and EBIT kind of sequentially, they were down a similar amount. And so kind of the decremental margins were maybe a little bit greater here. I know there's probably a few moving pieces as it relates to capacity additions and mix. But can you just talk about why we didn't see maybe a little bit more leverage on the margin side of things given the revenue outperformance in the quarter? Bernard Birkett : Yes. It was -- it's primarily around gross margin, and that's impacted by mix and then the overall absorption in some of our plants impacted the margin that we saw in Q1, but it was actually ahead of where we had predicted it to be, which -- so it was a solid performance for us in the quarter. Jacob Johnson : Got it, Bernard. And then maybe a longer-term question. A couple of years ago, you've all updated your LRP to 7 to 9. Since then, GLP-1s and Annex 1 have emerged or come to the forefront. I'm just curious if you think if either or both of those trends kind of change your thinking about your long-term or medium-term outlook? Eric Green : Jacob, this is Eric. I would say, at this point, we do not want to adjust our long-term outlook. However, we are excited about working with our customers in both areas that you described. One is in the GLP-1 sector, which we would be able to support our customers both in the elastomer side, but also in the -- in our Contract Manufacturing to be able to support them on their delivery devices. And on the Annex 1, we feel really good about where we are and the discussions that are ongoing right now with our customers and the trends that we're seeing aligns well with how we've positioned our portfolio all the way from if you think about the component specifications all the way to manufacturing design, container closure integrity, then you think about documentation services. The whole suite of requirements to make our customers successful as they transition and be ready for the Annex 1. So while we're very well positioned in both areas, it is about timing and change can take time and adoption could take time. So we are -- we would say that the long-term outlook construct is a range. But as an organization, we don't have a ceiling. So I'll leave it like that. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Paul Knight : Eric, as I look at the numbers, would it be fair to say that within Contract Manufacturing and proprietary delivery systems, you need to build capacity and there seems to be a ceiling right there for you right now? Eric Green : Yes, Paul. That's -- yes, I would characterize that as such. Probably more pronounced in Contract Manufacturing. We do have significant investments going on right now, both in Grand Rapids and Dublin, that will be -- validation will occur later this year, but most commercial revenues will be observed in 2025 going forward. And then in the high-value product proprietary devices, there are some constraints that we have due to capacity, but that's being layered in as we speak. So as the timing throughout the year, you'll see even stronger throughput later on this year. Paul Knight : Which leaves, I guess, standard packaging, the weakest? Is that a fair assumption? And is standard -- what's in standard packaging to make that the weakest, if it is? Eric Green : Well, if I -- let me rephrase that. I think the HVP components for us, most of the destocking that we've experienced earlier this year is around that category. However, that particular part of the portfolio will ramp up quite -- very nicely sequentially throughout the year. So it is -- most of the -- if you look at the Q1, the proprietary elastomer side, it really is due to destocking at this point in time but very strong outlook towards the end of the year and very strong obviously beyond that. Bernard Birkett : Yes. I think, Paul, on that, it's important to note that we don't anticipate any major mix shift. There's still the growth opportunities around HVP and in the biologics space. And even in Q1, that continued to grow. And you could see the growth driven there by the growth in NovaPure. So from a mix perspective, I think when you look at it in the whole, areas are growing. And our growth potential, as we look out past '24, around standard components and packaging and HVP, the trajectory is the same; that they are the growth drivers. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I just have a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I mean you talked about the cadence and the progression of revenues through the year. I want to focus a little bit more on the margin side of things. I think we previously looked for a little bit more of a jump from 1Q to 2Q on the gross margin on Proprietary Products and on operating margin as well. Is it fair to say that given your comments on timing of revenues in 1Q, 2Q, that the second quarter margins will be a little bit more subdued as well and it will be closer to the first quarter? And then I've got a follow-up. Bernard Birkett : We expect margin improvement sequentially as we move through the year, and that hasn't changed since we spoke about it in February. We would see growth in operating margins step up quarter-over-quarter. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. And then on the contribution of price versus volume and mix in the quarter, price was a little bit weaker than we had expected. Is that just a component of mix and some of the destocking you had talked about? Or should we expect price to be a bigger contributor as you go through the year? Or is that being at half level about right? Eric Green : Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean last year was a unique situation due to inflationary pressures. This year, I think we discussed in February that we're targeting between the 3% to 4% corridor on net price contribution, absent of any HVP mix shift. And so we started the year off in line with what we expect 3% to 4%. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Justin Bowers : Eric, earlier you talked about some of your customers returning to pre-pandemic safety stock levels. Do you have a sense on when that normalizes this year? And what it means in terms of typical ordering patterns? Eric Green : And so we're seeing some of that return in Q2 as we speak. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're seeing -- we're still seeing some destocking occurring into Q2. And as we look at the order patterns in the second half of the year, and we -- and obviously, we're -- as you know, we're make to order. So we get -- we have a purview if you look out multiple quarters ahead of us, it is stronger than it has been in a number of years, if you normalize for COVID. So we feel good about the -- when we talk about sequential growth on the revenue for the next several quarters, we feel very good based on the order patterns we're currently seeing today. Justin Bowers : Contract Manufacturing side, last quarter, you talked about some operational improvements, I think, maybe in Arizona. But is that somewhat of a gating factor until you implement those and get the throughput through? Or can you maintain the same productivity levels while you're making those changes? Eric Green : It's -- this will be within our high-value product devices portfolio. It's a smaller piece of our overall business. There are some -- as we make these improvements, there are some, I guess, constraints as we continue to manufacture, but most of those have been -- are being resolved as we speak. Bernard Birkett : Yes. And I think the productivity improvements that we're actually working on right now don't impact our current levels of production. And we would -- again, we would see a sequential improvement in the throughput around that business. So we're not looking at a step back there. Eric Green : No. Justin Bowers : Appreciate the questions and sorry the background noise. I've got some guys on my roof. Eric Green : No problem. Justin Bowers : Totally appreciate it. Eric Green : No problem. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : I was going to say Justin, let us know if you need us to come rescue you. I was going to come back to the mix. I hope I don't confuse the situation further. But just trying to understand the original question, I guess, Jacob's question about the decremental margin and the moving parts there. I understand revenue was lower overall and so you have absorption impacts from that. But NovaPure, you call out as strong, and we've identified that the margin contribution from that ought to be really, really high. And then it sounds like you have some other reasonably high-margin contributors that are being destocked. And so I guess I wanted to make a plea for maybe a little bit more granularity, so we could understand the moving parts there. And then how that progresses as you see the sequential improvement through the balance of the year, possibly? Bernard Birkett : Yes, David. So it was really in some of the other areas of high-value products where we saw some step back in Q1. But what we do expect to see as we progress through the year, the volumes around that business to increase again sequentially. And that's when we talked about the destocking earlier on in the year where we're seeing it was across all different parts of our business. So we would expect that HVP growth to accelerate as we move through the year and then the margin -- and that to be reflected in our margins. And also, we'll get the pickup of incremental or increased throughput as we move through the year. I think Q1 was our lowest level of throughput, and we're a high-volume business. So absorption does get impacted. David Windley : As a follow-up, in these areas of higher demand, GLP-1s being one of the previous call outs that you responded to, it's increasingly apparent that the efforts of the sponsors to get those products ultimately to market are very multifactorial with so many different elements of the supply chain investing aggressively to bring up capacity, you all being an example of at least 2 different areas where you're investing. To what degree do you have dialogue with those clients or visibility to understand? You invest and you add NovaPure capacity and you add injection device capacity but fill-finish capacity is a challenge, for example, and that could be a rate-limiting step that you also need to anticipate relative to the order patterns. Like how are you able to do calculus around that? Eric Green : Yes, David, that's a good observation is that not just upstream, but downstream, we have to be aware of. We do have very strong, very long-term relationships with customers that are in this space. So those relations are very -- are well established, where we do interact with them about their demand profiles, min to max type of conversation for the various drugs and so we're sensitive towards that. Obviously, we don't speak to any of those volumes of a customer. But the way to look at it is -- so to your question, if there's bottlenecks somewhere else in the value chain of -- to get these products into the market, we have to be aware and we try to work with our customers with that understanding. Our role is to make sure that we aren't the bottleneck. And so as you think about the elastomer side of the business, a lot of those assets are fungible. So these lines are not exclusive. So if we have to make a high-value product plunger, we're able to do that in multiple high-value product facilities and our customers can improve more than one site. When it comes to Contract Manufacturing, it is a little different. That's installed capacity and there's a theoretical maximum to it. And that is one of many suppliers in that space. So that is different. That's a very tailored business model for a customer or multiple customers. So that's how we are tackling this, Dave. So we -- as we look at the investments, on the elastomer side, we feel really good about where we are with our capacity. We have been expanding capacity. So we're in a very good position. On the Contract Manufacturing site, we will -- if and when awarded additional contracts, we will build out, expand and ramp up production to peak volumes within 1 or 2 years. So that's pretty typical of the model that we have today. David Windley : That's very helpful. If I could just sneak a last one in. On the destock, is it possible to size or quantify or comment to -- is the impact of customer inventory management in 1Q, the peak and you expect that to wane; still continue into 2Q, but wane as you continue through the year? Can you comment on that? Eric Green : Well, I will say, it will wane. Yes, it is going to wane throughout -- as you talked about, throughout the year. And that's supported by our confirmed orders as we think through the balance of 2024 and also the discussion we had about sequential growth quarter-over-quarter for the next 4 quarters. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Lawrence Solow : Just a few follow-ups. I guess just on the -- any update? I know you mentioned Annex 1 and whatnot. Just any qualitative thoughts on -- that you can speak to, just conversations with customers on potential conversions of legacy products going forward? Anything that you could speak to there? Eric Green : Larry, thanks for the question. Yes, we've been having a lot of active discussions. And as I mentioned at the recent conference that we attended in New York, that was clearly the #1 discussion point. And it's interesting is that we're very well positioned to be able to support our customers as we kind of think about how do our customers get ready for -- to be able to support and provide product with the regulations of Annex 1. Now the one comment I will make is that one of the clear indicators that the most interest is coming from the multinationals. I think originally, there might -- thinking around just the European firms, but this clearly is a discussion at a multinational level to really simplify their own supply chains. And so that's encouraging. And it's -- and again, it's not just for new drugs. It's really a heavy emphasis on the legacy portfolio. So that's about as much as I probably can give you without going too detailed, but these are active dialogue discussions that they will take time. It will depend on the customer. It will depend on the drug that they like to transfer, but we're well positioned to have those discussions and then act upon them. Lawrence Solow : Great. I appreciate that color. And just a question on R&D. I think R&D increased last year, I think, 16%, 17%. What's sort of the outlook this year? I know Q1 looks like it was only up a little bit year-over-year, but I know the quarters could jump around a little bit. Just thoughts on R&D? And where is the lion's share of that increase going into? Is that -- I know a lot of investment into Corning, but is it going into a lot of different areas? Bernard Birkett : Yes, Larry, as a percentage of revenue, we expect R&D to be pretty constant as we go through the year. And where is that money going? A lot of that increase is around integrated systems and how we're building that out. And again, it is our partnership with Corning and supporting that and developing that market. Lawrence Solow : Okay. And just lastly on price, I think you had like a little over 3% increase you mentioned this quarter. Is that about -- that also could probably move around a little bit, but is that probably a good run rate you think for the full year? Eric Green : Yes, that's correct. That's a good position to be in for us. Operator : Thank you. And I see no further questions from the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back now over to Quintin Lai for any closing remarks. Quintin Lai : Thanks, Olivia. Thank you for joining us on today's conference call. An online archive of the broadcast will be available on our website at westpharma.com in the Investors section.

    "content": "\ufeff John Sweeney : Good morning, and welcome to West's Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. By way of introduction, this is John Sweeney, the new Head of Investor Relations at West. I'm delighted to be here and I look forward to working with all of you. We issued our financial results earlier this morning, and the release has been posted to the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. On the call today, we will review our financial results, provide an update on our business, and present an updated financial outlook for the full-year 2024. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call and a copy of the presentation is available on the Investors' section of our website. On Slide 4 is our Safe-Harbor statements. Statements made by management on this call and the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts. The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. Actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made here. Please refer to today's press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risks to which it is subject, including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. During today's call, management will make reference to our non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric Green : Thank you, John, and welcome to West. And I would like to thank Quintin Lai for his partnership over the past eight years and for his many contributions at West. We will start on Slide 5, where I will cover three main topics : First, examine the drivers of Q2 performance; Second, discuss our revised outlook for the remainder of 2024, and; Third, provide insights on our long-term financial outlook and why we remain confident in our growth strategy. Let's begin with Q2 performance. We had a lower-than-expected second-quarter impacted by continued customer destocking. That being said, we are seeing promising signs from our customers that give us confidence of a turning point in this trend. Looking ahead, we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with a return to year-over-year organic growth in the fourth quarter, led by our proprietary products segment, specifically Biologics. We have adjusted our full year 2024 guidance to reflect a more gradual recovery as compared to our previous expectations. While I'm disappointed that we are lowering our guidance, I want to reiterate my confidence in West's proven market-led strategy and attractive long-term growth potential. Turning to Slide 6. We are the market leader in containment and delivery of injectable medicines, which is one of the fastest growing areas of healthcare. We have even stronger position in Biologics, which is the fastest growing segment with injectables. Our products are addressed in the most critical therapeutic areas, including immunology, oncology, rare diseases and obesity. And for the past five years, West has achieved a CAGR of double-digit organic revenue growth demonstrating that we have been able to deliver our long-term financial construct of 7% to 9%. Moving to Slide 7. Our confidence in our medium to long-term trajectory is underscored by our ongoing capital expansion projects. The investments we have made to address COVID are now being repurposed to drive increased capacity to address new opportunities. In addition, we have expansion plans focused on HVP products that provide a combination of increased manufacturing capacity and higher level of global standardization through our network. And for Biologics, GLP-1s and changing global regulatory requirements, we are seeing increased customer interest for higher quality, lower particulate, and more standardized solutions. This favorably positions West's innovations and leading products such as Westar Select and NovaPure. Another focus for our capital allocation is our HVP devices, which includes our self-injection devices. Our platforms are an integral part of our customers' drug device combination products that are making a difference to patients. These expansion projects remain on-target for the back-half of the year and 2025. And lastly, before Contract Manufacturing, we have an exciting growth contribution from our new capacity at our Grand Rapids site. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join our team as we open this new portion of the state-of-the-art facility in support of our customers Injection Device platform and producing product in Q4. And we have the ongoing expansion in Dublin, which is already dedicated to contracted demand for components associated with drugs for diabetes and obesity. We expect it to be completed by the end of Q3. Our promising growth drivers have us positioned to drive significant value for our customers, the patients and shareholders as we move forward. Shifting to Slide 8. At the end of June, we published our 2023 Sustainability Report on the company website. Proudly, we received several accolades, including being named as one of the America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2024 revenues and profits, where we saw a mid-single-digit decline in organic sales as well as declines in operating profit and diluted EPS compared to the second quarter of 2023, given the current market dynamics. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2024 guidance. First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non- U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 22. We recorded net sales of $702.1 million, representing an organic sales decline of 5.9%. Looking at Slide 10, proprietary products' organic net sales decreased 8.4% in the quarter as customers destocking continued at a higher rate than anticipated. High value products, which made up approximately 71% of proprietary product sales in the quarter declined by double-digits, primarily due to decreased sales of our Westar, Daikyo Crystal Zenith and FluroTec products. Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market experienced a mid-single-digit decline, primarily driven by lower volumes of Daikyo Crystal Zenith and Westar products. The pharma market units saw a low single-digit decline, primarily due to a reduction in sales of admin systems and Westar products, while the generics market unit declined double-digits, primarily due to lower volumes of our FluroTec and Westar products. Despite these revenue declines in the quarter, we do expect revenues in the second half of 2024 to be greater than the first half. Our Contract Manufacturing segment experienced mid-single-digit net sales growth in the second quarter, led by growth in sales of components associated with injection-related devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 18% was a 650 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 28% for Q2. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit, EPS decreased by 28.4%. Now, let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to organic sales decline in the quarter. Sales price increase has contributed $21 million or 2.8 percentage points of growth in the quarter. More than offsetting price was a negative volume and impact mix of $65.5 million, primarily due to lower sales volume caused by customer inventory management decisions in the period and a foreign currency headwind of approximately $6.1 million. Looking at margin performance, Slide 12 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.8% for Q2 2024, down from 38.7% in Q2 2023. Proprietary products' second quarter gross profit margin of 37% was 690 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2023. The key drivers for the decline in the proprietary products' gross profit margin were lower production volume due to the reduced customer demand in the period and an unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by increased sales prices. Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 16.2% was 80 basis points greater than the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to increased sales prices. Now, let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating cash for the business. On Slide 13, operating cash flow was $283.2 million for the six months ended June 2024, a decrease of $24.1 million compared to the same period last year, or a 7.8% decrease, primarily due to a decline in operating results, offset by favorable working capital management. Our second quarter 2024 year-to-date capital spending was $190.8 million, $33.3 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase both our high-value product and our contract manufacturing capacity. Working capital of approximately $849.3 million at June 30, 2024 decreased by $415.3 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a reduction in our cash balance. Our cash balance at June 30, 2024 of $446.2 million was $407.7 million lower than our December 2023 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to $454.1 million of share repurchases and our capital expenditures offset by cash from operations. Turning to guidance, Slide 14 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full-year 2024 net sales guidance to a range of $2.87 billion to $2.9 billion from a prior range of $3.0 billion to $3.025 billion. There is an estimated full-year 2024 headwind of approximately $5 million based on current foreign-exchange rates. We expect organic sales to decline approximately 1% to 2% compared to our prior guidance of 2% to 3% growth. We are updating our full-year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $6.35 to $6.65 compared to a prior range of $7.63 to $7.88. Also, our CapEx guidance is expected to be $375 million for the year, which is an increase from the previous guidance of $350 million. The increase in CapEx is driven by additional investments in growth initiatives and the timing of spend on one of our major projects. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Full-year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an estimated FX headwind of approximately $0.03 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, which is a decrease from the prior guidance of $0.04. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.22 associated with first half 2024 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 15, we are the market leader in injectables with an even stronger position in Biologics. We are seeing promising signs from our customers that destocking is at a turning point. We are investing significant capital in higher growth areas with expanded margins and cash-flow, and I'm confident that we'll achieve our long-term financial construct with our proven market-led strategy and future growth drivers. With great pride, we will continue to live by our purpose, and make a positive impact on patient lives. Shannon, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hi, Eric. I have two questions. Number one, in this destocking environment, is it things related to COVID, or is it, you know, broader than that like injectable drugs, et cetera, if you could kind of give color on that. And then lastly, these new expansion specifically cited in Kinston and Grand Rapids, do they contribute to revenue here in 2024, and therefore your improved 2H? Eric Green : Yes. Thank you, Paul. The destocking -- the activity that we are seeing is actually a combination of both. Obviously, we're still seeing a little bit of destocking in the COVID vaccines. But also during the pandemic, there was several of our customers when we are having discussions with them were increasing their safety stock levels significantly to from several months to because our lead times got a little bit longer. Now that we've installed the capacity, we are -- our service levels are at an all-time high for our customers, and we're able to respond quickly, they are now taking down those safety stock levels. So, it is a combination of both, but it is also allowing our customers to normalize their safety stock for our products in the market. Our belief, and speaking with our customers, the end patient demand on the molecules still remains in-line as what we expected. Our -- the market shift is not occurring, is consistent, as we've been speaking for the last several years. And our win rates in new molecule approvals continues to be as good, if not in some cases, better than what we had in the past. So I feel really good where we are moving forward. In regards to our investments, two particular areas in Contract Manufacturing will be online in second half of this year. That's in Grand Rapids, Michigan and also in Dublin, Ireland. And then in regards to proprietary, yes, we have additional benefits coming from Kinston and other expansions in our HVP plants towards the end of this year. Paul Knight : Thank you. Eric Green : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Larry Solow : Great. Thank you, and good morning, and welcome, John to the company. I guess, Eric, just a couple of questions. It sounds like the demand environment or mid to long-term environment hasn't changed at all. I'm just curious on the destocking and inventory levels, how is your visibility on with that. Are levels like back to where they were pre-COVID or maybe even lower? What gives you kind of confidence that customers aren't maybe this goes even a little bit longer than thought. We keep kind of moving that to the right a little bit. You sound pretty confident that you have a good hold on it, what kind of gives you that confidence? Eric Green : Yes, Larry, there's two-fold there. One is, in the beginning of the year, after having discussions with our customers, we had an indication that the return will be a little bit sooner than we anticipate. What I mean by that is, a little more pronounced back to normalized demand curves in the second half of this year. As we progress through Q2, we started seeing the intra-quarter demand slightly less than we anticipated, and we see that persisting a little bit into Q3. So we do see sequential improvements over the next couple of quarters, and as I mentioned, returning back to growth in Q4. And that is really our customers are gradually going back to where they were pre-COVID. So, we don't see any variations below or any variation slightly above. It's just pretty much consistent when a customer tells us what they're targeting, i.e., 12 months or nine months or 16 months. I will tell you though, every customer that we're speaking to has a different algorithm that they manage to. So, it's not universal from one customer to the next. And as we go through the different segments, whether it's generics, biologics or small-molecule pharma, they're also in different stages of this -- of the destocking. Larry Solow : Okay. And in terms of the CapEx, obviously, a little bit of an increase I guess, to me, it certainly signals your confidence, although you mentioned a little bit of timing there. But as we -- if we look out over the next few years, do you expect to still kind of spend this $350 million to $400 million in investment? Is that something that you still have a several year runway to continue? Eric Green : Let me start and I'll turn it over to Bernard because that's important -- it's a good question, Larry. Our investments more recently have been I mean, obviously, during the COVID pandemic, it was focused on HVP, particularly around stoppers and finishing of those HVP products to be able to support the vaccine growth. We're able to pivot that as -- those assets as we speak right now to continue to produce other HVP products for our customers. These additional investments we've been layering in really is to really support, I would say, three specific areas. The continuation of the biologics growth and our participation in that area is extremely high. So, we went ahead of the curve, so these investments we've been making is really more in the finishing process. And when you go into Kinston, Jersey Shore, Eschweiler, Waterford, that's what you'll see. Secondly is, we are a significant player in the GLP, and from two angles, one on the proprietary elastomer side, which we've always had a very strong foothold and we continue to do so on all commercial drugs. And frankly, there are several that are in the pipeline that are being in development by several customers and we're participating in that arena also. But also in Contract Manufacturing, where we are producing and will produce even more auto-injectors and pens, that in some cases doing some of the filling at the end of the process for our customers. So, it's -- that's the second area is around the GLP-1s. And the third area, which really kind of ties us to the Biologics also is that a more -- there's more demand in the future talking to our customers about some of these regulatory changes that we're working through with them on moving all standard material more up the HVP curve. So, those are the three areas that we really focused our capital. Now the long-term, I want Bernard to touch on that because that's a good question. How long will those persist? Bernard Birkett : Yes, Larry, just two things on that. One on the increase in CapEx for this year, really the major driver behind that is a business that we've been awarded from customers for our Dublin facility, and where they actually want us to put the capacity in place sooner than originally anticipated. So, we pulled some of that CapEx that we had earmarked for '25 into '24 to meet those requirements. When we look at the longer-term, we're really targeting about 6% to 8% of revenue. So getting back to pre-COVID levels of CapEx for our business. And you know, but that again, if and that's based on the demand that we're seeing today, and how we're going to meet it. If that demand increases or goes beyond that, and particularly around finishing capacity is the areas where we see that could potentially happen, then we would deploy more capital, but it will be very growth-focused if that was the case, and always around or predominantly around HVP. Larry Solow : Got it. And the 6% to 8%, Bernard, the CapEx of revenue. Does that kind of support your sort of 7% to 9% targeted growth outlook, not this year, maybe I don't know if it begins next year, but certainly a multi-year sort of 7%, has that changed at all that 7% to 9%, or should -- just to rephrase it. Bernard Birkett : No, the 6% to 8% would support that level of growth. And as we say, if we go beyond that, and then it depends on what areas and where the growth comes from, we always have the ability to go and adjust that. And, but again, the CapEx remains very growth-focused. And I think we're getting to like 60% to 70% of our CapEx budget is really growth-focused at this point and predominantly around HVP and then some, as Eric said in Contract Manufacturing but that's for very specific customers and very specific businesses. Larry Solow : Got it. And sitting here today, I know it's a -- there's no guarantees it's hard, but do you feel comfortable that you can return to sort of that 7% to 9% growth in end '25? Eric Green : I won't be able to pinpoint exactly which quarter over the next few quarters, but we will get back to that 7% to 9% construct. Like I said earlier, our position in the marketplace, the areas of growth that we're focused on is Biologics and some -- and across the entire portfolio, what's outsized that growth is biologics, GLP-1s and some of the work we're doing for our customers whilst moving up the HVP curve. So yes, we feel confident we will be back to that 7% to 9% construct. Bernard Birkett : Yes. And if you think -- I remember, within the construct, Larry, there's three drivers in there. One is volume, the other is price, and then you've got mix-shift. So you've got three drivers supporting that construct over the long-term. And if you look back over the CAGR between 2019 and as to where we're guiding today, you know that, that's about 10% growth, right? So, that construct is underpinned by those three drivers. And then if you look at the areas that Eric just called out that support that thesis, particularly around the mix shift, you're looking at the change in regulatory landscape GLP or high-level of participation around biologics and then demand normalization, plus we have the infrastructure and capacity in place now to be able to respond in the required lead times by customers to be able to support that growth over the next number of years. Larry Solow : Got it. Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you guys. Eric Green : Thanks Bernard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Eric Green : Hi, Justin. Justin Bowers : Hi, good morning and thank you. So, just a couple of questions. How is the coverage ratio shaping up? And how has that changed throughout the year? And then, the other question would be, just in terms of the destocking, I think earlier in the year, you mentioned that it was skewing heavier towards standard components versus like HVPs. I'm just curious if that's still what you're seeing. Bernard Birkett : I'll take the second part and then I'll hand that -- Eric Green : I'll take the coverage ratio. Bernard Birkett : Eric, will take the coverage. Eric Green : Yes, absolutely. So Justin, so, thanks for the questions. The coverage ratio is getting stronger. So there's two aspects we look at is firm, confirmed orders scheduled out and we're seeing that increase nicely, not just on a percent ratio perspective, but on absolute dollar for both Q4 of this year and also going into the early part of 2025. So that's one aspect. And therefore, as that kind of increases the intra-quarter demand profile is actually is less of a factor in the growth of the business. And so, we're seeing that come back a little bit slower than we originally anticipated in the middle part of this year as we were articulating back in February, I believe. And so, that's why hence why we changed the guidance. But when we look out to Q4 and into 2025, we're seeing very strong indication with confirmed orders, and our discussions where customers are lining up exactly to that conclusion when we look at their destocking programs and when they feel they'll be at a level that they feel is acceptable. So, it's lining up nice. You want to touch on the destocking? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So on the destocking, Justin, when we look at that, we have been seeing that in our Biologics segment and in Generics, that's where we saw the biggest impacts here in the second quarter. And you know that's really where as we were going through COVID, that's where we saw the most pressure also around lead times where customers really had to manage their supply chains. And that's where we believe the safety stock built over time. So that's why we are seeing destocking in those areas right now, and -- to a larger extent versus comparing this to our other market units. And you can see that play through then on the impact on our gross margin and operating margin is that that's impacting our mix. So we're having, one, volume impact because of that, but we're also having a mix impact. And I think what we saw in COVID and what we would see when we return to normalized growth rates and in seeing that gross margin and operating margin expand in line with our long-term constructs and potentially beyond that. So that's, I think that's where we -- when we look at it, we're looking at it from a revenue perspective, but also looking at an impact on margin, and saying how do we get back to the margins that we're used to delivering on? And when we see those biologics and generic market start to normalize, we'll see the revenue rebound and also from a margin perspective, we'd see that also. Justin Bowers : Understood. And then maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your improved throughput. Do you have a sense from your -- or conversation with customers, are they now trying to manage inventory levels in line with your lead times or -- just trying to get a sense of change in ordering patterns and where that might normalize? Eric Green : Yes, Justin, exactly that's the point. We're unfortunately during the pandemic due to the demand that was put on our business, our lead times did go up to anywhere between 30 weeks to 50 weeks. And with the consistency now in the last several quarters of, call it, 8 to 12 weeks, sometimes earlier, sometimes a little bit longer depending on the processing, our customers are realigning their reordering patterns based on those lead times. And we're seeing that clearly. So, as they built inventories during the longer lead time periods and during the supply chain constraints during the pandemic, and across the whole industry, we're seeing that also coming down, but also the realigning. So what you'll see a pattern of more frequency instead of one large bolus is more paced throughout the next three or four quarters, which by the way is also very effective for our operations. So it aligns real well with where we want to be long-term. Justin Bowers : Got it. Appreciate the questions. Eric Green : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Avantika Dhabaria with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mike Ryskin : Hi this is Mike Ryskin from BoA. Just want to go back and just touch on the destock one more time because that's where we're getting the most debate. I mean, I appreciate all your comments about coverage ratio and conversations with your customers, but you also had similar comments after 4Q and 1Q earlier this year. So, it just seems like the situation does evolve and the conversations with customers do evolve, as well as to the guide for 3Q and 4Q, it seems like there's a little bit of a step up implied in 3Q and a pretty sizable step up in 4Q just to get to the fiscal year numbers. So, why not take an even more conservative guide at this point in the cycle? I mean, it just seems like there's still some risk that the destock could evolve one more time. So, just would love to get your thoughts on that as you progress through the year. And then, tied to that, I'll throw in my second question right away. It has to do with the margins and the EPS outlook. Is there any incremental cost cuts that are assumed in 4Q -- 3Q or 4Q to get to the EPS number? Obviously, volume de-leverage has a big impact on gross margins, but just wondering what's implied there as you go through the year. Thanks. Bernard Birkett : Yes. So, what we are seeing is that, for Q3, we don't see any major step up continue in the way we're -- we've been going. Some sequential improvement, as Eric mentioned, and the -- then a step up into Q4. And that step up in Q4 is really driven by the customer segments within biologics and a reasonable improvement in generics. But the main driver is around the biologics market, and that's what we're seeing, and that's the information we're getting from our customers. And that informs the basis of our guide at this point. And as Eric said, then there are metrics around that which are giving us confidence that, that will actually materialize. And then on the EPS, we have been managing our cost base pretty tightly, as you know, we're very operationally focused, and we've been managing the variable costs across our plants. As we have been going through 2024, one thing that we have to be cognizant of with cost management is that when we're expecting to get back to growth, we need to make sure that we have the right resources and capabilities in place to be able to support that growth so we don't derail it. So we're managing that pretty tightly. Other than that, there are -- we're not making any significant cost cuts, but we are -- I would think -- I would say we're using appropriate cost management to manage through the de-stocking period, although it has extended a little bit longer than we originally anticipated. But also, we have to be prepared for returning to growth to make sure that we're able to support our customers with that. Hopefully that helps. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. I just want to go back again to what exactly happened in your quarter from a de-stocking perspective. If I go back to the initial outlook from the Q4 call where you had incorporated about 200 basis points to 300 basis points of the cut from the Q3 call last fall from de-stocking, but mentioned that 75% of de-stocking was from six customers. Obviously, the first quarter results themselves actually were positive relative to the outlook you'd provided and you maintained the guide for the year. So, now having 400 basis points, 500 basis points come out of the organic guide with about four months left -- four months, five months left in the year is -- the magnitude is pretty large. So just -- was it -- going back to conversations specifically with that group of big customers, was it something that historically if you use the term broadened and worsened, did things broaden and worsen further? Was there one or two pockets of customers or product categories? Just trying to understand what happened from mid-April to the end of June in terms of the big change here. Bernard Birkett : Yes, Matt, I'll start off and then, if Eric, if you want to add. What we did see as we were progressing through Q2 and the level of intra-quarter orders that we would have anticipated to materialize in that period of time, it wasn't at the rate that we would have expected it to be. So -- And then there was some timing with customers moving some orders out late in the quarter would have -- has impacted us. And then it's -- as we've looked at the balance of the year, and as we've rolled through the end of June and practically through July, what we're seeing in Q3 is that orders that we would have anticipated materializing for the period and even some for Q4, they just weren't coming through. And when we assessed what was happening there, it's still really related to levels of de-stocking. So it's gone longer than we would have originally anticipated. And that is essentially the main driver. And what we -- when we had looked at it originally, our coverage rate for Q3 and Q4 was pretty much in line with or a little bit ahead of pre-COVID levels. But what hasn't happened then is filling in between the actual orders confirmed and the forecast that we had, that hasn't accelerated in the way that we would have anticipated that, that would take place. And so when we did the assessments, we felt that we have to be transparent and do the right thing and take the guide down, and do it with the right level where we don't want to be in the position where we're cutting and cutting and cutting. So hence the reason why the drop in the guide is pretty significant. It's not something we want to do, but it's reality that we're dealing with today. I think the good thing and the positive for us is that it's actually returning to growth in Q4. So, it's really pushed it out a quarter. And again, Q4 isn't as strong as we would have originally anticipated. So we've taken that down as well. Eric Green : And I'll just add to this. Thanks Bernard. And -- so it became more of a gradual recovery, I believe, in what we're seeing versus a more pronounced Q3 recovery. And that's actually one of the drivers of why, based on the customer conversations, it's a still similar group of customers across multiple segments. Yes, there's some of the larger ones we highlighted earlier in the year that they're actually going through the process and then getting closer to the end of that process. But as we look through with these discussions, we look at where they are in their process, where we are with our able to produce products in a very short period of lead times, we are confident moving back to a long-term construct. And that will, it's going to take a little more time than we anticipated, but as it indicated in the guidance that we gave, we're getting closer to that in Q4. And we believe that will carry on going forward. So yes, Matt, that's a very clear statement we made earlier this year about being more acute, but it's taking a little bit longer to work out than we anticipated in the industry. Matt Larew : Okay, understood. And I think having observed this in the bioprocessing industry over the last 18 months, fully appreciate that it's challenging to understand customers' pace of inventory work down. And at times, maybe there is competing incentives in terms of them wanting you to have capacity available for demand that they may or may not give you in the next quarter or two. So, in light of that, you referenced now understanding that customers are managing to, you're now more normalized to reduce lead times. As part of those conversations, do you feel like you have a better understanding of how much inventory is sitting out there? And when you kind of combine those two observations, does that give you conviction specifically, not in the back half of the year, but specifically in the third quarter? And how did you incorporate perhaps the, better understanding of where customers are at into the way you're just thinking about this back half guide? Eric Green : Yes, Matt, the clarity of more recent conversations than the beginning of the year gives us that conviction of where we're going in the near term. And moving up to, when I talk about the mid to long term, getting back to that growth algorithm we've been accustomed to and we expect based on our market position and what we see ahead of us. But yes, we're -- the clarity of where they want to land with the safety stock and the confidence they have in our ability to deliver and meet those service levels that we expect and our customers expect, and we're able to do that today with the capacity we have online. And that's the reason why we continue to fuel the capital so that as the growth continues to occur in 2025 and beyond, is that we're well-positioned versus getting behind the curve, which would happen during the pandemic. So, we have much more visibility today and better clarity. And we're firm on making sure that we are going to be delivering what we said we're going to deliver. Matt Larew : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Eric Green : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Your line is now open. Jacob Johnson : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to go back to the EPS guidance, you're pointing to kind of down 1% to 2% organic growth this year. And I think it would seem to apply probably like 300 bps to 400 bps of operating margin contraction, which is kind of greater decremental margins than the long-term algo would suggest. Can you just flesh that out a bit more, some of that capacity additions, et cetera? And then I think I heard Bernard mention earlier, perhaps as revenues recover, maybe we could see something better than 100 bps of margin expansion. Can you just talk about the incremental margins as we return to growth in 4Q and beyond? Bernard Birkett : Yes. So, the major impacts on margin that we've seen here in Q2 is really driven by volume and then mix. And for a high volume manufacturing operation, any decrease in volume like that is going to have a significant impact. And where we're seeing it, Jacob, is really in HVP. So, the drop is in biologics and generics. And so, we're getting this kind of outsized impact on margin, where if you look back at take the COVID years when we were getting a large amount of expansion in HVP and growth in that area, we were getting outsized margin expansion, well beyond our 100 basis points. So, essentially what we're seeing now is the reverse of that. So, when things normalize and we start to see growth again and getting back into our long-term construct, that volume growth will be driven within HVP. And then also that aligns with the mixed shift as well improving where our HVP was in the kind of mid-70s as a percent of proprietary revenues. And today, we're saying it's about 71%. And that's the type of impact it has on our business. So, when we're returning to growth, we would expect to see that margin recover pretty much, pretty quickly and in line with that growth, particularly around biologics and the generic space. And then -- Jacob Johnson : Thanks for that, Bernard. Sorry. Bernard Birkett : It's all in gross margin. The OpEx was pretty tight. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Makes sense. And then maybe just on the stopper vial side of things, you guys referenced the capacity you brought on during COVID and repositioning that now for non-COVID applications. Can you, one, talk about the timeline for kind of transitioning that capacity to non-COVID demand? And I guess, two, the other concern I think a peer of yours referenced the other day is that you weren't the only one who brought on capacity during COVID and lead times are shorter and they suggested that customers are going below pre-pandemic inventory levels. And I think investors may be worried that this could be structural for some time. Can you just talk about that dynamic as well? Thanks. Eric Green : Jacob, I'll take that. So, first of all, on repurposing the assets, that's done. So, we're able to leverage not just for like NovaPure stoppers, but also use the processing for plungers as an example or other types of SKUs in the HVP portfolio. So, the team has done a great job to get those assets ready to go and they're ready to go. And so, as demand comes in, we're ready to respond accordingly. In regards to what our customers are telling us in regards to where they want to stay with their safety stock, because of where we are in the supply chain, and if you think about the economics of our product as a percentage of the drug molecule, we don't see that going any further down below pre-pandemic levels. So, we believe it's going to -- for us, I can't speak for others, but for us, with our customers, for the types of products we provide, the lead times that we can provide, and the number of SKUs we provide our customers, we believe based on the conversations, we'll be back to pre-pandemic levels. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for that, Eric. I'll leave it there. Eric Green : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. I have another question on visibility. Can you discuss the breadth of your visibility? And I ask because I'm wondering if we're in a situation where you have close contact and visibility with those large customers, but rather it's the long tail of smaller customers that are driving the downside surprise. Eric Green : Actually, the -- So, Dan, thanks for the question, but the more variability has been with the larger customers. And the smaller customers, although obviously we're very focused on that because that's really being the pipeline when you think about new developments, and the volumes there are less, and the frequency of orders are probably a bit higher. The predictability of which quarter lands in is lower, but the order of magnitude on the stocking impact is less. So, I'm not sure if that helps, but obviously a very important part of our portfolio are the small, smaller biotech pharma companies when you think about their innovation pipeline and how that feeds into the whole ecosystem of the injectable medicine space. But the impact that has on our fluctuation on the revenues is not as great. I don't know if that helps, Dan. Dan Leonard : That's great. Thanks for that clarification, Eric. And a quick follow-up. You mentioned that the new capacity in Dublin opens in the third quarter. How important is Dublin to the fourth quarter revenue ramp? Eric Green : Not really. I mean, the team is going to work really hard to have -- to get that capacity up and running in full utilization. But the reality is it takes us a few quarters to ramp any new site of that magnitude up to full capacity. So, I would suggest that's not a major driver to why we're calling -- giving the guidance the way we are for Q4. Dan Leonard : Got it. Thanks a bunch. Eric Green : Yes. Thank you. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Windley : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm going to try to ask a few in a different way. Eric, in June when we were together, you talked about 50% or maybe a little less of your revenue comes from large customers where your visibility is higher, I thought you said, because of the high volume that you do with them, the connectivity that you have with them, and then the smaller customers are much more volatile, and you kind of, to Dan's question there, commented on that. I thought you said that your visibility or your forecasting accuracy around those large customers was really accurate over time, but you also then just said that those are actually the source of the destock. And so, I wanted to make sure I understood kind of the historical accuracy and tie in with those large customers, but seemingly a disconnect on that right now. Is that the right way to think about it? Eric Green : No. What I would say is that -- and so, David, thanks for the question, but I would say is that the larger customers have larger variability. When they do, we'll have a discussion about a forecast, and then they would, when we get to the point of actually firming up as a firm order, there is some movement that is occurring. And since it doesn't take many of them to have a meaningful impact compared to the smaller account. It is true on a smaller account, and maybe I should have been clearer. When we look at degree of accuracy, we're looking at quarter versus quarter prior year. And therefore, in the smaller accounts, that's less predictable on which exactly month, quarter it will land. We have a high repeat business model, and we mentioned this before, that majority of our revenues, it's almost annuity-like, every year, there's a repeat, and then would -- the variable would be drug demand up or down, and then that's the throttle. But in this particular case, when we talk about the degree of accuracy, the smaller accounts from a quarter versus prior quarter is a little more harder to predict. But from a impact to the revenues, the larger accounts are the ones that have a more meaningful impact on the dollar value perspective from one quarter to the next. David Windley : Got it. Okay. And then in terms of the improving confidence, I guess I'd like to key on, on Bernard's answer about kind of the cuts to this year and order patterns. You know, earlier in the year, your coverage was encouraging relative to pre-COVID levels, but then the fill-in on top of that not coming as you expected. Can you give us some sense of what is the normal level of coverage versus the amount of go-get? Like, how much go-get do you have for the second half of the year, in absolute or relative that gives you the confidence that you can get to the levels that you're now setting? Bernard Birkett : Yes. The exact number, we're not going to give out for like pretty obvious reasons, but it's our coverage rates and the go-get that we would have to do now on this new guidance is, I would say, we're more confident around that and delivering it and being able to get it. And it's -- that go-get is based on conversation with customers, understanding their order patterns and changing order patterns and factoring all of that in, and then understanding what their forecasts are. So, that's what's given us the confidence. So, the size of what we have to go-get isn't as large from a dollar perspective. And, as I said, when we talked about it earlier in the year, we had a level of confidence around it and anticipate a certain conversion rate. Obviously, that hasn't materialized in the way we would have anticipated. So, we have adjusted our guidance to reflect that and give us confidence about being able to deliver on the numbers now that we're guiding to. David Windley : Got it. And Bernard, to your point, you did say -- management did say similar things about, when those six customers kind of arose and kind of shockingly were not going to be ordering as much earlier in the year and the guidance was 2% to 3% instead of, the 7% to 9% construct. So, you had those conversations earlier in the year and, we're talking about having them again here in the middle of the year. I guess I'd also invoke, you mentioned that, you go back to pre-COVID levels and look at the growth rate. We've done the same. You said 10. It looks like it's even a little above 10. I guess using that construct, if we were to use the midpoint of the LRP, the 8% of your long-range targets, that would imply a revenue level that's still a couple of hundred million dollars below where you're guiding today, or said differently that next year would be a flat year to grow into an 8% growth rate from 2019. How do we get confidence that there are factors that, you know, that bias to the upside what that growth should be or conversely that there's not still a couple of hundred million dollars of overbuying in your customers' inventory levels that they still need to work through before you get to that multi-year growth support level? Bernard Birkett : Yes, David, I'll start with this one here. One of the biggest drivers in the last five years' CAGR taking out COVID was the biologic growth. If you recall back five, six years ago, our participation rate was high, but the percentage of sales of biologics was sub-20%. And I don't have the exact number, pardon me, but it was about 20% of our overall business, if I recall. And as the years progressed over those five years, the number of approvals, the number of biologics that really accelerated the market, and there's a few that we still see continue to outpace the demands that we forecasted with our customers, which is a positive. Now, the base of that business is much larger. I believe it's -- we were roughly around 40%. So, 2x it as a percentage of the whole company and the whole company has grown or doubled in size. So, as we kind of think forward a little bit, the 7% to 9% is -- why we say the financial construct going forward is 7% to 9% is we feel -- we take that in consideration, it's a bigger base we're operating off of. Continue with the leading with the HVP and the biologics area will give us that type of growth off of a close to a $3 billion business. David Windley : Got it. Okay. I'll leave it at that. I was going to ask one more, but I've probably beaten it up enough. Thank you. Eric Green : Thank you. Bernard Birkett : Thanks David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom DeBourcy with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Tom DeBourcy : Hi, good morning. Eric Green : Good morning. Tom DeBourcy : Good morning. Just had a quick question, I guess on CapEx. And, you know, so the current level of CapEx, 12% to 13% of revenue, and I just wanted to get a sense of how you're, I guess, metering the demand, or long-term capacity expansion versus maybe short-term weaker demand due to de-stocking. And then just as you look to 2025, I think consensus has maybe the number going down to $300 million of CapEx and just, I'm not asking you to endorse that number, but just, would you expect CapEx to be down year-over-year in 2025? Eric Green : Well, I'm not going to guide 2025 at this point, but what I would say is that the investments we're making and the higher level of CapEx that we're experiencing right now, compared to pre-COVID levels is really targeted at growth in a number of different areas. And for us to layer in that capacity, you're looking at 12, 24, like 36 months in some cases, depending on the lead times of the equipment and the technology that we're installing. And so -- but when we're doing that, we're looking at what markets are growing, we're looking at the regulatory landscape, what changes are requiring there and what finishing capacity we need. We're looking at GLP from both a proprietary and a contract manufacturing perspective. And then we're also looking at our participation across biologics. And again, what sort of capacity we need there. So we've got three pretty powerful drivers for growth coming on over the next couple of years. I mean, for us, we need to have that capacity installed to meet that demand when it actually materializes so we can respond. So we don't get into the position where our lead times get pushed out like they had during the COVID timeframe. Looking beyond, as we said earlier on the call, we would expect our CapEx over the next year or two to get back to more normalized levels of 6% to 8% of revenues. You know, that's what we will be targeting. And that supports the long-term construct growth of 7% to 9% on the top, and be more focused again on creating that mixed shift and supporting that HVP growth. So hopefully that kind of gives you some color. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to John Sweeney for closing remarks.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric? Eric Green : Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Prior to discussing our quarterly performance, I would like to take a moment to express our heartfelt thoughts and support to all our team members and communities affected by the recent hurricanes and weather-related issues. For precautionary measures and to ensure the safety of our team members, we closed our Florida manufacturing site ahead of Hurricane Milton. I want to extend my thanks to those team members who were affected by this storm as they truly represent our One West culture. While there was no damage to our St. Pete plant, many of our team members have faced personal challenges. I'm truly proud of their efforts that enabled West to seamlessly serve our customers without disruption. Now let's turn to slide 5 and the Q3 performance. We had a solid third quarter with revenues and adjusted EPS coming in at the higher end of our expectations. Our West team across the globe continues to execute at a high level, motivated by our purpose of improving patient lives. The strong quarter performance was the result of our solid execution and close collaboration with our customers. This allowed us to meet our customers' demand requirements, in some cases, ahead of schedule. As a result of Q3, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. This reinforces my confidence in West's execution capabilities as we continue to deliver a proven market-led strategy and attractive long-term growth potential. Turning to slide 6, West continues to have a strong position in biologics, the fastest growing segment within injectables, not only for current drugs in the market, but also for new drug launches where our participation rate remains very high. Our HVP components are addressed in the most critical therapeutic areas, including immunology, oncology, rare diseases and obesity. We expect to see some improvement in biologics in Q4, driven by the continued ramp in wearable self-injection devices. A key aspect to our growth strategy and market leadership is West's team of scientific thought leaders and technical experts. Through valuable insights, they continue to address the evolving needs of the complex development process and regulatory requirements to meet the needs of our customers. As a market leader in the containment and delivery of injectable medicines, we continue to have productive dialogues with our customers at key industry conferences. For example, at the recent CPHI Worldwide Conference, our West experts held a podium presentation about contamination control strategy in primary packaging as part of the EU GMP Annex 1. We know that a drug manufacturer's contamination control strategy is only as strong as its weakest link, making the quality and control of materials from third party suppliers critical factors to their process. We remain well positioned with our HPP capabilities to support our customers' pipelines for the future. In addition, we're starting to see early traction with our long-term growth initiatives, particularly with GLP-1s and how we serve our long-standing customers. With our market leadership and proprietary products, and continued strength in contract manufacturing, we are making meaningful investments to drive increased capacity to address these new opportunities. We are also making significant progress in ramping up production of HVP delivery devices. The strong increase with on-body self-injection devices during the quarter was driven by a combination of capital investment, improved utilization and the implementation of a new production line. We anticipate this ramp up to continue into the fourth quarter as we execute on our expansion plans. We have initiatives in place to improve the margin, including optimizing our manufacturing process, driving efficiency through automation, and scaling to fulfill customer demand. Now let me shift to de-stocking as this remains a factor with our customers. We are starting to see signs of stabilization within our business. In recent customer discussions, we have observed a positive shift, with some customers showing interest in increasing their near-term order levels. This gives us confidence that we're getting closer to a turning point in the de-stocking trend. We now expect continued signs of normalization in our pharma business, improving trends in biologics driven by the ramp-up and delivery devices and continued destocking with some generic customers into 2025. Now I'll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard? Bernard Birkett : Thank you, Eric. And good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2024 revenues and profits, where we saw low single-digit decline in organic sales, as well as declines in operating profits and diluted EPS compared to the third quarter of 2023. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter, as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2024 guidance. First up, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on slide 7 and the reconciliation of non-US GAAP measures are described in slide 16 to 20. We recorded net sales of $746.9 million, representing an organic sales decline of 0.5%. Looking at slide 8, proprietary products organic net sales decreased 0.5% in the quarter. High value products, which met approximately 75% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, declined by low-single digits, primarily due to de-stocking of our FluroTec, Nova brand and Westar products, offset by an increase in sales of our drug delivery devices. Looking at the performance of the market units, the pharma market unit saw a mid-single digit increase, driven by an increase in the sales of Nova brand products and administrative systems. The biologics market experienced a low-single digit decline, primarily driven by de-stocking of FluroTec, NovaPure, and Westar products, offset by an increase in our drug delivery devices. And the generics market unit declined mid-single digits primarily due to lower volumes in Nova brand products. Our contract manufacturing segment revenue on a constant currency basis was consistent with the performance for the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating profit margin, 21.5%, was a 270 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 14.4% for Q3. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefits, EPS decreased by 10%. Now let's review the drivers in both the revenue and profit performance. On slide 9, we show the contributions to organic sales decline in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $34.2 million, 4.6 percentage points of growth in the quarter, as did a foreign currency tailwind of approximately $2.9 million. Included in sales price is a $19 million customer incentive associated with achieving volume levels. More than offsetting price and FX was a negative volume and mix impact of $37.6 million, primarily due to lower sales volume caused by customer inventory management decision in the period and a mix shift from HVP components to drug delivery devices based on customer demand. Looking at margin performance, slide 10 shows a consolidated gross profit margin of 35.4% for Q3 2024, down from 38.6% in Q3 2023. Proprietary products third quarter gross profit margin, 39.2%, was 420 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2023. The key drivers for the decline in proprietary products gross profit margin were lower production volumes in our high margin HVP components and a mix shift to lower margin drug delivery devices, which we expect to increase over time with yield improvements from automation. These margin reductions were partially offset by increased sales price, inclusive of the previously mentioned customer incentives. Contract manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 19.9% was 130 basis points greater than the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to production efficiencies. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating cash for the business. On slide 11, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $463.3 million for the nine months ended September 2024, a decrease of $74.1 million compared to the same period last year, a 13.8% decrease, primarily due to a decline in operating results. Our third quarter year-to-date capital spending was $272.1 million, $18.8 million higher than same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase both our high value product and contract manufacturing capacity. Working capital of approximately $1.034 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased by $230.5 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a reduction in our cash balance. Our cash balance at September 30, 2024 of $490.9 million was $363 million lower than our December 2023 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to $506.5 million of share repurchases and our capital expenditure is offset by cash from operations. Turning to guidance, slide 12 provides a high-level summary. We are increasing our full year 2024 net sales guidance to a range of $2.875 billion to $2.905 billion from a prior range of $2.87 billion to $2.9 billion, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange. There is an estimated full year 2024 headwind of approximately $1 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect an organic sales decline of approximately 1.5 to 2%. We are raising our full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $6.55 to $6.75 compared to a prior range of $6.35 to $6.65. Also, our CapEx guidance remains at $375 million, which is unchanged from prior guidance. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an FX headwind of $0.02 compared to the prior year, which is a decrease from the prior guidance of the $0.03 headwind. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.26 associated with the first nine months of 2024 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric. Eric Green : Thank you, Bernard. To summarize on slide 13, we had a solid Q3 performance with a high level of execution focused on our purpose. We are the market leader in injectables with an even stronger position in biologics. We are investing in capital in higher growth areas with focus on execution, expanded margins, and cash flow. And I'm confident that once the market demand normalizes, we will achieve our long-term financial construct with a proven market-led strategy and future growth drivers. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Congrats on the quarter. I guess just first on the organic growth guidance, you guys obviously had a really strong 3Q, but you did kind of narrow organic growth towards the lower end of the range. I realize we're talking about 25 bps there, but is there anything that got worse versus your prior expectations that you could call out? And then just along the lines of guidance, the $19 million fee you guys called out, was that something that was contemplated in prior guidance or was that a proverbial good guide this quarter? Bernard Birkett : Jacob, I'll take that. On the second part of the question, yeah, the $19 million was contemplated. It was obviously based on volumes that we had to achieve in agreement with our customer, and we achieved that. So it wasn't a surprise to us. On the guide itself, it's really just rounding the change for Q4. So no real material change. The difference from Q3 to Q4 is really timing on when we delivered on customers' orders and some expectations. So again, no real change to our outlook on the year. Jacob Johnson : Bernard, maybe sticking with you, I think inter-quarter, you mentioned the potential for your margin profile to return to 2023 levels once you return to LRP growth. Can you just talk about your visibility into getting back to that kind of margin profile and kind of how quickly post de-stocking you can get back to those levels? Bernard Birkett : It's really down to when demand normalizes and also the mix within our business normalizes. When we get to that point and we get back to our LRP, then the margins adjust back to the 2023 levels. So it's really a mix impact and then that level of demand normalization. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Lawrence Solow : I guess first question, just on the quarter itself, obviously, a pretty solid quarter, especially relative to expectations. Was the higher end driven more on the just slower customer de-stocking or was it more on the demand side? Any way to kind of parcel that out? And it does sound like there's a little bit of, I guess, timing maybe was a little bit of a good guy in the quarter too? Eric Green : No, absolutely. What we observed in Q3 was really a couple factors. One is around execution, continued to deliver on the commitments that we made with our customers. And secondly is that, in a few cases, our customers are \u2013 they have accelerated some of their programs and asked us to deliver a little ahead of schedule, but they were contemplated and planned for already within the second half of 2024. So it's really mostly around timing has given us additional growth in Q3. Lawrence Solow : Eric, I know it's too early to look out to 2025, but it does sound like without putting an actual number on it, it does feel like you guys are perhaps a little more confident that we at least begin that recovery, maybe don't get fully normalized for the full year, but do you feel like as you look out, we could have a relatively normal kind of demand year for you guys or not much inventory destocking at least going forward? Eric Green : Larry, there's a couple of factors around there. One is the underlying focus of our business is very, very strong, and we continue to participate in very attractive areas and a number of initiatives that are in flight and the traction is very positive. We have been speaking about destocking, particularly in the last quarter, we highlighted what we felt was going to play out in 2024, and that's what's happening. We're seeing it consistent to what we said earlier, which is basically we do believe in our pharma business that has mostly normalized, as we speak, and so you can see that little bit of return to growth in that particular area. We're seeing improving trends in biologics, but we did say that that would be throughout Q3 and a little bit in Q4, so we do see that continue to play out as is. And then we did call out, and we still do, destocking with some generic customers that go into 2025. So, my comment was around certain signs of stabilization with our business because it's consistent to the conversations we're having with our customers today, and there tends to be a little more positive in those conversations, but let's get through Q4 before we even comment about 2025 at this point in time. Lawrence Solow : Just if I could squeeze one last question, just CapEx plans going forward, does this feel like this is the peak year or could 2025 be sort of similar roughly? Any thoughts on that, Bernard? Bernard Birkett : I think, again, we'll give guidance on CapEx for 2025 in February, but it is something that we are looking at based on the demand that we're seeing and where the capacity increases that we need to add. We'll continue to add where we see growth, and we'll continue to review those programs. But over the next, I would say, 12, 24 months, we'll be looking to get back to a more normalized level of CapEx, and that's the trend that we're starting to see, Larry. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Eric Green : The comment about wearable injection devices, does that mean Phoenix line is built and producing, and then kind of the follow-up is, could we get an update on Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the Dublin facility as well? Eric Green : Twofold. The first one on SmartDose, particularly our Phoenix facility, you're correct, that ramp-up started in Q3, where we did receive FDA approval for commercial manufacturing into the market, and we're really excited about that new team that has been put together and just the level of capability of the ramp-up. They are meeting expectations, and I'm really proud of that team to really go from a brand-new facility and now producing high-quality products going to the market. So I'm very pleased. As you know, a lot of these startups and these ramp-ups do take time, so it's going to be \u2013 it's going to take several quarters to get to what I call peak throughput, but the initial results are very, very positive. In regards to the facility's investments in Grand Rapids and Dublin, these are two contract manufacturing facilities that are really focused on the \u2013 to build, support our customers and GLP-1s. On Grand Rapids, Michigan, that is still ramping up, as we speak. We are producing commercial product, but it is still in ramp-up phase. As you know, that takes probably a good three to five quarters to really get to the levels that we expect and what our customers expect as throughput. On Dublin, it's a little bit longer. This is kind of a two-stage approach. The first is the manufacturing of the devices for contract manufacturing, again, GLP-1s. And that will commence shortly, probably early 2025. And as that ramps up, we're also adding in that facility, already communicated before, but just to reiterate the drug handling. So we'll be taking a finished drug product contained and put it with the device that we're going to manufacture there, so it's a complete solution for our customer. We're really excited about that because that's playing out our high-value product or high-value focus on contract manufacturing, adding services and capabilities that really help us expand not just revenue, but also margin in that particular business. So there are different timelines. They're on us right now. Teams are executing as planned, and I'm excited to see full production in the near future from both sides. Bernard Birkett : Just to also on the Phoenix site, that's in two phases. What we've added currently is another manual semi-automated line, and that's what we're ramping. And then as we progress through 2025, we'll be implementing a fully automated line to drive production efficiencies, greater levels of utilization, and also to meet the customer demand for that product. So that will happen throughout 2025. So we expect to see margin improvements in that product line over the next 6 to 12 months. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Going back to some of your comments on 3Q benefiting from some timing, meeting some customers ahead of schedule, just curious if you can dig into that. Was it one or two large orders, or was it a little bit broader in terms of the timing benefit? Was it in more of the pharma customer where you talked about destocking normalizing or in biologics? Now that you've completed those orders and you deliver them in 3Q, are there others behind them to fall into queue in terms of backlog? Is there other work behind that to backfill? Eric Green : The work that we did with our customers is somewhat broad. I won't isolate it to one or two customers, and it was primarily in the areas of biologics and pharma. And so, there's specific reasons behind it, but these are obviously requests we already had in our production plans, our schedules to be able to support our customers on these specific products, but they were brought forward to meet their needs and their demand. Now, obviously, we won't comment into 2025, but as we think about for the rest of the year, as our customers continue to replenish their orders, we will obviously be ready to respond if orders do come in later this quarter in Q4 for those particular customers. But as we speak right now, that's the reason why you see \u2013 we call out a little bit earlier delivery of those particular products into Q3 versus Q4. Michael Ryskin : And quick follow-up on the \u2013 you talked through the changes on the top line for the guide. For EPS, I think you raised the midpoint by $0.15, but $0.05 cents of that \u2013 $0.04 was incremental stock-based comp, $0.01 was FX. The $0.10 that's operational, is that driven by the mix, the one-time benefit, the $19 million you saw in the third quarter? Just talk us through the $0.10 there. Bernard Birkett : It's driven by a number of things. Mix was part of this. Our operating margin was a little bit stronger than we would have initially anticipated. And so, it's really managing mix and also managing costs within our business on an ongoing basis to drive that margin improvement and improvement in EPS. Not just one thing. Operator : And our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : At the risk of asking a simple question, I noted, I guess, first, you've used the Nova brand in commentary today. And I know you also talked about that at a conference in the quarter, but I think that's the first time we had heard that. And I noted that in your comments today, you did also use NovaPure, so they seem to be distinctly different or maybe parts of the same broad category. Could you talk about what Nova brand is, what it includes, how new is it, and how is it that it is the source of growth in some and the source of headwind in others? Eric Green : That's a good question. So, Nova brand encompasses the quality design principles of our highest quality product. One is NovaPure, which is the laminated version with FluroTec, and then the non-laminated version is NovaChoice. And what you'll find is NovaPure is highly adapted in the \u2013 it's called in the biologics area, and NovaChoice tends to be more adopted in the pharmaceutical area that doesn't require the coating. And so that's the nomenclature of the products. Now, NovaChoice, it depends on the segment. So as you know, NovaPure is \u2013 again, as I mentioned, really well-adapted in the biologics, and that's where we had some destocking occur throughout 2024. We called that out in Q3. We anticipate a little bit going into Q4. In the NovaChoice, that is one of the key solutions in the GLP-1s for us to support our customers. And so, as you can imagine, the ramp-up that we're starting to see in the GLP-1s, we're able to support them with their high participation rate of really NovaChoice and also Westar RU that we provide our customers in that area. So that's how it's defined between the two. David Windley : If I could ask, I'm going to squeeze two follow-ups. So just on what you just answered, is the NovaChoice pricing similar to NovaPure? And then secondly, Eric, on your comments about participation rate remaining very high, which you've been very consistent about, would you be willing to talk about what you think your wallet share is? I believe your definition of participation rate is your specced-in on the product. How does that look in terms of sole versus dual source or otherwise in the participation rate? So price on NovaChoice and then wallet share, please. Eric Green : On NovaChoice, it's between $0.15 to $0.30 per unit on ASP, 50% to 60% margin. To give you kind of perspective, so the key differentiator, again, is the barrier code of of FluroTec between that and NovaPure, which, technically \u2013 from a user need basis is quite a significant difference between barrier and non-barrier. And in regards to participation rate, you're right. We do look at are we specced-in in the filings of our customer, the drug companies of our product. And there is a few cases where you do see dual sourcing. But what we are seeing and we continue to see is that we \u2013 in these particular examples, we are very high as far as the percentage on the drug molecule. And that hasn't changed. If you're talking about a particular area like GLP-1, we're really the key player in that space from a volume perspective. And that's pretty consistent as we look at biologics in other areas. Yes, there is some testing for dual sourcing capabilities, but that's more for \u2013 it's not as frequent and it's more on new launches, not on existing molecules in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Matthew Larew : I wanted to ask about contract manufacturing. I'm not sure what the text is. It's a very specific question. The contract manufacturing, gross margins there were up nearly 400 basis points sequentially. You've referenced obviously scaling capacity in Dublin and Grand Rapids and also adding new capabilities with higher revenue margin potential. Most of the story over the last, call it, five, seven years has been margin expansion on the proprietary product side. I'm just wondering if you could maybe \u2013 using this quarter as a window into what the potential is for contract manufacturing moving forward. Bernard Birkett : Matt, I think if you're looking out over the next 12 to 24 months, we see a slight uptake on the contract manufacturing as kind of drug handling. Business comes on board because that is a very different margin profile for current contract manufacturing business. But for us to scale that is going to take a little bit of time. I would anticipate the margins around contract manufacturing to be relatively consistent with what they are now. We get a little bit of variability between quarters depending on product mix and the level of kind of DA or engineering work that's involved. So it's pretty consistent within the high teens. So it's more of a longer term where we would see a significant step up in the margins within CM. Matthew Larew : As a follow up, again, a number of times today called out GLP as an offset to some of the destocking, your strong share in that space. Yeah, it's sometimes hard from the outside to compare the cadence of benefit to you versus what we might see from some of the drug companies themselves in terms of their sales reporting. Could you basically give me sort of a state of the union as to where you see \u2013 to the size of your business today to the extent you can quantify that and also any updated thoughts on go forward growth and market opportunity? Eric Green : Just to clarify, we're specifically focused on the GLP-1s. I just want to make sure I heard that correctly, correct? Matthew Larew : Correct. Correct. Eric Green : Sorry, I just wanted to make sure I heard it correctly. Yeah, no, absolutely. So we will not talk about the demands of our customers. I would refer to them on the future demand of the GLP-1s in the market. But if we take a look at how we are positioned, the agreements are in place and where we play, we play in two areas, one in proprietary, which is the elastomers and seals, and then the other area is contract manufacturing. Let me just touch on contract manufacturing quickly, then I'll move back to proprietary. In that area, we do participate, as I mentioned earlier, around, for example, the investments in Grand Rapids and also in Dublin to manufacture and assemble the auto injectors and pens. So we do participate in that. But that is, as you can tell, it's highly competitive. We're selective on what projects or initiatives we want to take on because it's heavily capital intensive. And so, we're participating in that area and it does support us with our large customers, but it's very selective. On the proprietary side, and that growth, by the way, will be dependent on end patient consumption, so whether it's a pen or auto injector. On the proprietary side, if it's a vial configuration, we're obviously there with our stoppers. We have been, we will continue to be. And then if it is in a pen or an auto injector, we do provide the plungers and also insulin sheeting if needed on their configuration. And that is very high as far as the volumes that we are producing going forward. We have forecasts. We really haven't done that. We haven't really called that out as a specific area, but it is starting to pick up with the investments we put in. If we look forward, what we need to do to be able to support that growth, the capital that we require, a lot of it's already installed, which is very positive. We do need, over time, based on the forecast that we are working with our customers on, is looking at maybe some more HVP finishing, similar to what we put in Kinston. We're putting into Jersey Shore and also in Eschweiler. But it's really the finishing area that we are looking at, as you know, that's fungible to other types of customers like biologics around HVP. So that's kind of where the investment thesis will be if and when needed. But, fortunately, we have \u2013 because of our investments over the last few years, really supports the growth in this particular area going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with DB. Justin Bowers : Eric, can you maybe at a high level just talk about what inning you think we're in with respect to the destocking? Amongst the different components, are you closer to the finish line versus others like, let's say, standard versus NovaPure versus FluroTec? And then part two would be just around the margins. You've had some pretty high decrementals this year. As volumes begin to normalize, is there any reason why you wouldn't have greater incrementals on the way back up and maybe above construct? Eric Green : Justin, let me take the first part and then Bernard, if you don't mind, on the second part. In regards to kind of where we are with the destocking area, I think the way that we've consistently communicating is that it's not equal across the entire customer portfolio and or product portfolio. By the way, the product portfolio is really driven by the market segments. And so, we've been pretty clear that, in the pharma area, the small molecule, we've seen that more normalized recently. So we feel if you want to look at from the spectrum, it's closer to the end, let's say. And we're starting to see more normalization of order patterns and future outlook. We look at the biologics, it is very clear with our customer conversations. If you take the drug delivery devices off the table from a discretion point of view, the [indiscernible] products used for containment, that particular area, we continue to see destocking in Q3. And as we mentioned, we'll see a little bit more in Q4. We do see that getting closer to the end. But let's go through our Q4. And as we think about our order book going forward, we'll update you in the first part of the year about 2025. Biologics, so we've been pretty consistent that, particularly a few customers, that we believe that while there's some positive conversations about future demand, we do believe that's going to continue into the first part of 2025. So that's how we look at it from a de-stocking point of view. I didn't give you an aggregate total on that, but it is mixed based on the customer segments. And it's pretty consistent, it's playing out as we started to communicate, let's call it, the last quarterly call. And we'll keep an eye on that and make sure that we deliver and then in the year we'll reassess as we think about going forward. So the margin conversation, Bernard, can you? Bernard Birkett : On the margin, what we would expect is when demand normalizes and our mix normalizes, that we would get back to our 2023 levels of operating margin and then through the long term construct, grow 100 basis points per year off that. When we look at what's occurred this year in 2024, much of the de-stocking we've seen within biologics and generics, and that's where typically we would tend to see more HV product sales. And obviously, then the margin impact has been greater than what we would have seen prior to that when we saw de-stocking within pharma. If you go back and look at our margin expansion over 2021 and into 2022, a lot of that was driven by HVP growth and that mix shift. So that shows you the power of the construct we have. And when that biologics engine starts growing again and gets back to normalized levels of growth, we would expect to see that margin start to expand. And first thing is we need to get back to like pre-2024 levels of margin and then start growing off that. We're confident that will happen over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas DeBourcy with Nephron Research. Thomas DeBourcy : I just had a question around, I guess, generalized customer behavior in terms of orders. I guess through kind of others, the bioprocessing market, they've seen the pharma customers placing smaller orders more frequently versus maybe the typical cadence that they have been in place. I'm wondering if you've seen a change in how customers are also ordering or if you expect to go back? John Sweeney : Tom, I apologize. We're having a little trouble hearing your question. Would it be possible just to maybe move a little closer to the microphone or speak up, please? Thomas DeBourcy : My question was, I guess, around specifically kind of customer orders in a more general way. We've heard from some companies of bioprocessing supply chain that customers are doing smaller orders more frequently versus, I guess, their typical kind of cadence. I was wondering if you had seen any changes at all there or whether you expected to kind of go back to historical kind of timing and cadence there? Eric Green : When we look at an order pattern right now with our customers, it's more in line with the pre-COVID time period. I think it is different than during the pandemic period of time and also the last, call it, end of 2023 going into 2024. And there's two drivers to that. One, as I think you're pointing out, is starting to get to more normalized or stabilized environment. But secondly, as you recall, during the pandemic time, our lead times were significantly higher because of the demand on not just the core business, but also on the materials used for the pandemic. When I say that, I am very proud of the team and how they have with the invested capital, with the capacity we have online with multiple sites, particularly on the high-value products, we're able to build support our customers in a much more timely fashion, if not equal or better than we did pre-pandemic. And give you an idea that's like 8 to 12 weeks to make the order. It is highly customized. And during the pandemic, we're reaching 40 to 50 weeks. So it is a significant difference. So I just want to highlight that because there's two factors of why we're seeing order patterns change. One from the market, pharmaceutical supply chain effect, and the other one was really our lead times and customers are much more comfortable today. And confident in our ability to deliver their product from multiple sites on time each and every time that they requested. So hopefully I addressed your question, but we are seeing a change. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to John Sweeney for closing remarks.
