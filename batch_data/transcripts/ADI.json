Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Maxim Integrated Products reports results for the first quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Venk Nathamuni, Managing Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Maxim Integrated's Fiscal First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Tunc Doluca; and Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Kiddoo. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, I'd like to remind you that these statements must be considered in conjunction with the cautionary warnings that appear in our SEC filings. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this call involve risks and uncertainty, and that future events may differ materially from the statements made. For additional information, please refer to the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, which are posted on our website or available from the company without charge. Now I'll turn the call over to Bruce. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Thanks, Venk. I will review Maxim's first quarter financial results, which exclude the September quarter results for Volterra. Any statements we may make during this call regarding Volterra's financials reflect unaudited results. Revenue for the first quarter was $585 million, down from the fourth quarter. Our revenue mix by major market in Q1 was approximately 43% for Consumer; 29%, Industrial; 16%, Communication; and 12%, Computing. Our Consumer business declined as expected due to weakness in smartphones. Our Industrial business declined slightly due to seasonal weakness in our core Industrial businesses and declines in our Smart Meter and Medical businesses after strong growth in the prior quarter. Automotive grew for the third consecutive quarter. Our Communication business was up slightly with strengths in networking and Datacom, offset by reductions in our Cable Infrastructure business after a strong Q4. Finally, our Computing business was down slightly. Turning to Volterra, revenue for their September quarter was $36 million. Their Server business grew after a recovery from the prior quarter's inventory correction, and their Notebook business also increased from the prior quarter. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 60.7%, down from 62.3% in the prior quarter due to mix, lower utilizations and higher inventory reserves in Q1. Special items in Q1 gross margin were intangible asset amortization from acquisitions. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $207 million, down from $214 million in the prior quarter due to unusually low spending across multiple categories as we continue to tightly control spending. Special items in Q1 operating expenses included acquisition-related and restructuring charges. Q1 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $148 million or 25% of revenue. The Q1 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 17.3%, down from 18.5% in the prior quarter. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.41 compared to $0.44 in Q4. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $96 million, down from the prior quarter due to the payment of our annual employee bonus in Q1. Inventory was 110 days, flat with the prior quarter. Inventory in the channel, excluding catalog distributors, decreased slightly from 53 to 52 days, as channel inventory in dollar terms increased by 4%, but was more than offset by an increase in resales. Net capital additions totaled $38 million in Q1, up slightly from the prior quarter and within our target of 5% to 7% of revenue. Share repurchases totaled $154 million in Q1, as we bought back 5.5 million shares. We also paid $74 million in dividends to our shareholders. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments declined by $165 million in the first quarter to $1 billion. Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q2 backlog increased to $417 million, including $27 million for Volterra. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q2 revenue up $605 million to $635 million, including $35 million to $37 million for Volterra. Excluding Volterra, forecasted Q2 revenue is flat from the prior quarter. Q2 gross margin excluding special items, is estimated at 59% to 62%, flat with the prior quarter. Q2 gross margin is expected to be impacted by lower utilizations due to lower revenue in Q1 and Q2, and planned inventory reduction, with a potential offsetting benefit from lower inventory reserves. Special items in Q2 gross margin are estimated at $8 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. This excludes amortization of intangible assets and inventory writeups related to the acquisition of Volterra. Q2 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately 3% for Maxim, excluding Volterra, due mainly to the impact of our annual merit increase and equity grant. Q2 operating expenses will also include approximately $17 million for Volterra, which include stock-based compensation expense. We are on plan to achieve synergies of $15 million annually after the March quarter. Special items in Q2 operating expenses are estimated at $3 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. This excludes other potential special items that may occur during the quarter, including Voterra acquisition-related expenses. Our Q2 tax rate, excluding special items, is estimated within our long-term range of 16% to 20%. For Q2 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.37 to $0.41. Net capital expenditures in Q2 are expected to be up slightly from Q1 as we invest in new manufacturing technologies. On an annual basis for FY '14, we are targeting CapEx around the midpoint of our long-term business model of 5% to 7%. We expect to lower our share repurchases in Q2 compared to the higher level repurchases with the prior 2 quarters. Finally, our Board of Directors has approved payment of a cash dividend of $0.26 per share, approximately a 3.6% yield at yesterday's closing stock price. I will now turn the call over to Tunc to further discuss our business. Tunc Doluca : Thank you, Bruce. Good afternoon to all call participants. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated, and thank you for joining us today. At the very onset, I'm pleased to note that we completed the acquisition of Volterra Semiconductor earlier this month, and are very excited to have the Volterra team onboard. We added a highly-talented team with a distinguished record of innovation and product design, process development, advanced packaging and systems expertise. This team will complement Maxim's internal capabilities by delivering a significant time-to-market advantage in high-current power management application, targeting the enterprise and communications markets. The integration of the 2 companies is progressing well. And as a direct result of this acquisition, we expanded the market opportunity we pursue by an incremental $900 million in 2017 based on market research reports. Let me now discuss results for the September quarter. Our September quarter revenue was in line with the guidance we provided, while earnings per share were $0.02 above the midpoint as we continue to exercise operating spending discipline. Let me update you on lead times and bookings next. Our delivery lead times increased slightly, but still remained below our 6-week model. Customer order lead times increased from the prior quarter, predominantly due to longer lead time orders from our industrial customers. Bookings increased during the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio above 1. I'll next provide some color on our major markets. Let me start with consumer as customary. We expect our December quarter consumer end market revenue to increase due to shipments of Maxim products into new tablet, smartphone and e-reader platforms. We project smartphone revenues to be flat sequentially. We have production ramps of new products at our largest customer, as well as at other smartphone makers. However, this growth is expected to be offset by a decline from older generation smartphone platforms at our largest customer. Our high-integration interface power system-on-a-chip remains best in class, and customized version of this product continued to be designed in at multiple smartphone and tablet customers. In addition, we are expanding our technology offerings for mobile devices, augmenting our portfolio of power management, optical sensor, motion sensor and touch products. We are now shipping audio amplifiers to top-tier tablet makers. Our next-generation audio amplifiers have also been well received by major mobility customers. As we mentioned during our prior earnings calls, our product diversification is exemplified by our investment in sensors, both optical and motion. In the September quarter, we began shipping our second-generation gesture sensor into a major smartphone platform at our largest customer. We're also investing in our motion sensor portfolio to address the growing needs for human interface functions across a range of mobility platforms. From a market segmentation perspective, we continue to -- continue our engagement in the mid-range smartphone market and remain well positioned to participate in this segment. We're leveraging our technology, design IT and system expertise developed for high-end smartphones. Overall, we're working with multiple customers across a host of technologies and executing on our strategy to extend the adoption of our products beyond high-end smartphones. Second, let me discuss the industrial market. We project December quarter industrial revenue to be down primarily due to seasonality. We project meaningful growth in our Automotive business, offset by seasonal weakness in core industrial, as well as an inventory drawdown at a medical customer. Our differentiated strategy in industrial, where we generate roughly half our business from targeted vertical ASSP markets, continues to serve us well. For instance, in automotive, we see ongoing broad-based strength across multiple products spanning multiple applications. In the area of automotive Infotainment, we have design wins ramping into production for satellite radio and TV tuners at several automotive customers. Our overall automotive pipeline of design wins span a variety of end applications, such as Infotainment, power train and advanced driver assistance systems. We remain encouraged by the response of our customers to the breadth of our offerings and the value we deliver. Our highly integrated utility meter products, addressing both smart meters and solid-state meters, are gaining good traction at Chinese meter makers. These customers are supplying not only to the Chinese domestic market, but also are exporting to other Asian markets. Solid-state meters, which are a segment of utility meters, have all the features of smart meters, excluding the advanced communications interface. Let me now provide some commentary on our Distribution business. After rising slightly in the June quarter, inventory days in the distribution channels decreased by 1 day quarter-on-quarter in Q1. Base of inventory was 52 days at the end of the September quarter versus 53 days at the end of the June quarter. As such, distribution inventory continues to remain well below our target model. I would like to note that distribution resales were up 5% in the September quarter, as were end-market bookings placed on our distributors. Third, let me discuss Communications. We project Communications revenue to be flat sequentially in the December quarter. This is driven by an expected increase in business from the networking and Datacom end markets, offset by a decline from cable infrastructure products. Note that we saw a strong uptick earlier in the year in our cable products. The strength in our Fiber Optics business from the prior quarter is extending into the December quarter, as the China optical market experiencing a rebound in telecom infrastructure spending. Bookings trends remain strong. The strength in our Optical business spans a range of applications including Passive Optical Network and backhaul to support 4G LTE deployments. Our Base Station business registered a strong uptick in bookings during the September quarter. In this segment, we're seeing design win activity across our portfolio of RF, signal chain and power management products. Overall, we're focused on executing our strategy of delivering highly integrated solutions to the communications market, enabling broader coverage, increased capacity and lower cost of ownership to deploy the networks of the future. Fourth, in the computing market, revenues will be up sequentially, driven primarily by the Volterra acquisition. Maxim's organic business in computing is expected to be down sequentially, as an increase in business from financial terminals is offset by a reduction from notebook PCs. The December quarter will be the first quarter to include Volterra's revenues as part of Maxim's consolidated results. Therefore, let me provide some additional color on the Volterra contribution. As Bruce mentioned earlier, Volterra's September quarter results were in line with the guidance management had provided as a stand-alone company. Volterra's sequential revenue increases from both the server and notebook markets in the September quarter. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect revenue from the server market to increase, driven by seasonality, as well as new product ramps. And this was partially offset by a decline from notebook PCs. We're very excited that the Volterra team is now part of the Maxim family, and we look forward to their contributions to the combined company. In closing, we remain well positioned for growth across a broad range of markets. Our business model remains very attractive, and our strong profitability allows us to return a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders. We will continue to focus on delivering winning products and technologies that provide highly differentiated solutions to our customers. Venk, I'll now turn the call back to you. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, Tunc. That's the end of our prepared comments. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please begin polling for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : How do we think about seasonality of the Wireless business going forward? There's a view that as the smartphone market matures, the seasonality for the suppliers will be more moderate. So in the case of Maxim, December is typically down a lot in wireless this year, though, I think you're guiding it flat. And so are we seeing this somewhat take place? And as we think about March, does the same theory sort of apply where March has historically been a good quarter for wireless, but looking forward, maybe the seasonality will be more tempered? Tunc Doluca : Romit, so thanks for the question. So in terms of our guidance for the December quarter, we actually projected it to be slightly up for consumer revenue. And in terms of looking at seasonality just for the December quarter, obviously, we went through a major inventory correction in the prior 2 quarters. So we think that a lot of the corrections that we normally see in December, we believe that we've been through that, and that's why this year seems a little bit different. Now your question was more about going into the future, into March. And as you know, we don't quite like commenting that far out. There are just too many variables for us to be able to figure out what seasonality or unseasonal results we're going to get. And as you well know, there's all kinds of new models coming in. Frankly, we don't really know in terms of which sockets we've won or we've been able to keep for those newer models, as well as new functions that we actually are competing for that we were not in before. So it's very hard for us to really project any seasonality or any revenues into March, frankly. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : I understand. My follow-up is on dialogue, they announced that Samsung has adopted power management solution in one of the Galaxy derivative phones. How should we interpret that? Is that a concern for you? And I guess tied into that, how do you -- how does your content at Samsung look at this point heading into next year? Tunc Doluca : Well, I mean, I think we've talked about it before, I mean, there is -- there are many sockets available and there are different models across Samsung and across other companies as well. And we do our best to win as many of those sockets as possible, but I've said it before, you can't win all of them. But in terms of the major platforms, we've got good offerings, and it is competitive, but we've got great technology. And the customers definitely are very interested in our products as well. So I think going forward, we've got a good relationship with the customers, and we've got good technologies. So that's a good combination when you move forward in terms of winning designs and obviously, generating revenue as a result of that. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : And if I'm allowed one more question, Bruce, just on gross margin. Is 59% to 62% the new range to consider going forward inclusive of Volterra? Bruce E. Kiddoo: No. The slight downtick in our gross margin really has nothing to do with Volterra. As we said before, its gross margins are kind of very close to 60%, plus it's a relatively small part of our business. Our long-term gross margin model is still 61% to 64%. We've dipped slightly down just because utilizations have dropped along with the revenue drop. So I think we're confident that as the business grows and utilizations tick back up, we'll be back into our long-term model of 61% to 64%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions, I guess. First, I mean, there's been a dichotomy of -- from suppliers in the Samsung. Some folks had talked about things being very weak, even continuing into the December quarter. You guys are obviously talking about things being a little healthier, along with 1 or 2 other peers. Do you think that's completely a function of sort of how much medicine you took in Q2 and Q3? Or is there some share dynamics that are allowing you to do better in the fourth -- in the December quarter as well? Tunc Doluca : Well, if you look at how big of an inventory correction we did go through, I would say that, that absolutely had some effect on our results versus some of the other companies that are reporting. But I also think there's some effect on who's on which model with which sockets. So as you know, there's multiple sockets that are running. And there's multiple models that Samsung sell, and they ramp them at different times. So it really depends on those 2. We don't exactly quite follow who's on which socket unless we're competing for it. So for us to be able to predict that, it's pretty difficult. But I think it's 2 factors. Number one, the one you mentioned, which is that we went through pretty sizable correction; and the number two is, it also depends on which phone they're ramping it, what time and who's in those sockets. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. On the follow-up, Bruce, you had mentioned the reason for the slightly lower gross margins with the utilization. Can you give us a -- you said utilization was low. How much would factory loadings need to come up to get rid of those underutilization charges, if you can give us an idea of magnitude? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes. And to be clear, we didn't take a specific FAS 151 utilization charge, but just utilizations were down and that impacts absorption. And just some numbers, so in Q1, utilizations dropped down to 70%, right? And then we expect them to drop down again in the second quarter, as we kind of reduce our inventory, as we take it from the 110 days and try to bring that down, at least start closer to our target. So from that point of view, that's really what's driving down the tick down. To the extent that we get back over 80%, generally speaking, we're able to be within our range of 61% to 64%. The other thing that kind of impacted us in the first quarter was we did have inventory reserves above our normal range for the second quarter in a row, and certainly, we expect that going forward, that those will kind of return to their normal level. So I think utilization is getting back up over 80%, and inventory reserves coming in at their normal level will allow us to be within our 61%, 64%, where you saw us kind of operate for an extended time period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I was wondering if you could talk about just the pricing environment in mobile. And maybe the second part, if you could just talk about the competitive landscape in -- when you look at your optical sensors, it seems like you got a nice pickup with the tablet win that's ramping. But do you see any difference with competition with those more integrated parts? Tunc Doluca : Well, any of these sockets that actually you -- that are opportunities for suppliers, they're obviously very visible and they're large. So they got big targets on them. And obviously, a lot of suppliers want to win those sockets. So it is always competitive. But as long as we're ahead of the game by one generation or more, and we're able to provide technology to the customer that's interesting to them, we do better in terms of being able to keep the prices that we need in order to participate in the business. So the short answer is, yes, it is very competitive. But we've been able to stay ahead and be able to preserve the pricing that we need to participate. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And then on my second question, Tunc, I kind of asked this last quarter, but I'll ask it again. When you look at your Mobile business, you had kind of application processor-based VIN PMIC business, you got systems kind of -- or Power SoC, I guess, you call it, and then you got the optical sensors. You seem to indicate that PMICs were less of a kind of driver for next year. But when you look out next year, where do you see the biggest opportunities for you in mobile? Tunc Doluca : Well, in terms of opportunities, the ones that you already mentioned, the interface Power SoCs, the one that is pretty much in every phone and provides valuable functions, I think that continues to be an opportunity for us. We think that the advanced optical or gesture sensing products, they're an opportunity for us. We have -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we won some Audio Amplifier business, so that we believe is going to be -- continues to be an opportunity for us. And we've also, as you know, been working on MEMS sensors. They're better -- will contribute some revenue next year. I'm talking about calendar year now. But it will be just the beginning, so it won't be a huge contributor, probably. And I think in terms of application processor, PMICs, we still continue to make products for some of the other apps processor companies. And whether those will turn into large revenue or not will depend on whether they're successful or not in winning at the smartphone companies. I'm talking about the apps processor companies now. So it's a combination of all of these. I think that when we talk amongst ourselves here, we do have a lot of irons in the fire, and exactly which ones are going to be the ones that give us the best revenue return is to be seen. But there's definitely plenty of technologies we're working on and showing customers. We're showing it to multiple customers, and we're also showing it, since the products are similar, at all different types of applications, smartphones and tablets, mid-range smartphones, as well as e-readers. So they set lots of irons in that fire. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Volterra and especially, their Server business. It seems like you have the ability to get some critical mass there, or at least make it more of a scalable business. So could you talk a little bit about that, please? Tunc Doluca : So on the server side, specifically in that area, obviously, we believe that Volterra has some great technology to offer. The company in general has good revenue coming from the top 2 server manufacturers, so good wins there going into the future. These products usually have fairly long lives. It's not like the handset market. The design wins are done, and then they sell for a long time, which is good. We believe we do have other opportunities in -- for instance, that are really not very well tapped into in areas outside of the top 2 customers, such as cloud, servers and so on, and microservers. So that's an area that we're really going to go after more aggressively than Volterra could because we have a much wider reach in terms of our sales force. So there's opportunities outside of the top 2 customers, and those are the ones we're going to pursue. But as I said, those design wins take time, and the revenues take time to build as well. And that's why when we did our announcement, when we said that in terms of revenue growth, it's not going to come in the short term, it's going to come in the long term. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Understood. And my follow-up is on Automotive. It's had 3 nice good quarters now. It seems to be in a pretty strong momentum. Are you prepared to start breaking out that as a percentage of revenue? Or could you, at least, give us a sense of how big that business has become? Tunc Doluca : I'm sorry, I missed the first part of your question, can you repeat? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Yes. So your Automotive business has been growing 3 consecutive quarters, and it's hitting momentum. So I was hoping you could give us sort of a relative size of the business, so we know how to model it going forward. Tunc Doluca : Yes. So the Automotive business, we really decided to get into it, and sort of kind of gives you an idea of how long it takes to build revenue in our business. We started maybe 6 or 7 years ago to see some revenue. It was in the -- that's like 1% or 2% back then. We're getting into the mid-single -- mid to high single-digit range now, and it keeps growing. The good news about automotive is, once you start growing the business, it continues to grow for a while because new design wins are layering up on top of old ones which don't go away. So it is a market that we like. And as we've said before, the market size is expanding because of contents in the cards going up, and plenty of opportunities for a lot of analog and mixed signal. And a tremendous need for integration in that market, because as you know, the reliability depends really on keeping the component count down. So it's just playing right into our strategy, and we think that it's going to keep growing going into the future as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Tunc, I guess, one of the big issues for, not only you guys, but the entire industry this calendar year was just the fact that expectations for high-end handset smartphone growth this year just disappointed. I'm kind of curious, do you think that this is going to be -- end up being an anomaly year, and that growth is still there, or that the market is saturated? And I'm really asking the question because you guys, more than most, really exploited the high end of the market. And so I'm kind of curious if you think about mobility going forward, what's the right longer-term growth rate in that business that was sort of 15% to 25% year-over-year growth for you guys pretty consistently over the last couple of years. What do we -- what should we think about the long-term growth rate opportunity there now for you guys? Tunc Doluca : Well, I think, partially, we all somewhat got spoiled by the fact that we were in a large market growing, depending on which year you looked at it, anywhere from 30% to 40% per year. And we took advantage of it, I'm glad we did. But you know that at some point in time, you can't continue growing something large at 40% per year. So that growth rate has slowed. It's not like it's a declining market. It has slowed, but it is still growing. And the growth right now, more of it is occurring in the mid-range space. But the high-end smartphones are also still growing, even though at a small rate. So from our strategy point of view, we still continue to focus, number one, on the high end because that's where all the technology, the advanced technology gets developed. And then we take that technology that we develop and we leverage it into low-end phones. And the content in the low-end phones obviously is less than high end, because they're mid-range, because there is less functionality, meaning, there's less analog content. So I think our strategy is going to -- is working well because we still have lots of opportunities in the high end. It will grow slower, but we do have newer sockets and newer technologies we're going after, so that continues. Number two, in the mid-range, we just leverage the technology we've already developed and go to more customers where we can win those sockets as well. Frankly, we're not -- we're looking at the low-end, and that's not looking very attractive, so that's not part of what we're going after as a strategy. So my view and our view collectively in the company is that this is -- continues to be a good market. It's not growing 40%, 50% a year, but it's still growing, and there's still plenty of analog content to go for. And the company's overall share, global share is relatively small compared to the available market in smartphones in general. So I think the way it's going to shape up, in my view, it's going to continue to grow, but not at the levels that we saw in the past 3 years. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then, Tunc, last quarter, as you guys kind of hit this soft patch in smartphones, you talked about in the conference call, returning to growth in calendar year '14. And from a sequential basis, it looks like you're doing that in December. I'm just kind of curious, do you think that all of '14 could end up being a growth year for mobile for you? Or the first half compares this year just going to make that a tough accomplishment? Tunc Doluca : Actually, thanks for noticing that, because it is -- you're right, it did go up in the December quarter. However, looking deeper into the year, as I said before, I think, Romit had asked that question. There's just too many variables for us to be able to tell. You've got obviously the success of our largest customers' phones. We've got -- we don't have equal content at each customer, so it depends on how each one of them fares against the other. And finally, we're also trying to make sure that we maintain the current sockets that we own, and we're working on sockets that we didn't have before, new functions that weren't there. So there's just too many variables for us to be able to predict. But I think that next year, we're looking forward to it, and we're making the right moves to make it grow. But how it turns out, it's very difficult to tell. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Unknown Analyst : This is Anai Crow [ph] dialing in for Craig. As you guys look to further diversify your handset business, it's like how are you positioning your broad portfolio to participate in the growth in the Chinese handset market? Tunc Doluca : Okay. So obviously, there's a lot of customers in China, they're up and coming, they're growing very fast. And what essentially we do for that market is, as I said before, we took our technology that we've developed. For instance, I'll give you an example on the power area, because that's pretty lucrative. We can take the interface Power SoC we did and we developed for our major customer. And we're really able to take that and customize it for what the top Chinese manufacturers want and offer to them as a great solution. And that's one example where we can take technology we've got for high-end smartphones and really move it into other markets, other customers, as well as mid-range phones, for example. So we do have relationships, and we are pursuing design wins for all of our offerings with those customers as well. Now having said that, I said they're growing fast, but they're still -- compared to the 2 large customers in the space, they're very small. And I know that all of you know that, but it still is part of our strategy, as you said, to diversify the customer base, and we're definitely making progress in that area. Unknown Analyst : And as for my follow-up, on the MEMS sensor side, like, what's the initial customer feedback, and how's the process of sampling going on? Tunc Doluca : Yes. So on the MEMS front, we had, in our 6-degree of Freedom product, we did start sampling that. We talked about it on our previous calls. Our customers, in general, liked the performance. The main advantage that they've seen, and we really worked for, was to provide the level of stability to provide good indoor navigation service to our customers, and they definitely see that advantage. But it's not -- it is pretty competitive because other companies buying products have some other features and other performance that might be better than ours. So it's really a tradeoff for the customer. And they're looking at our products and the competitors products, and trying to make a decision. But in general, the feedback we had received was good, but it's not like we were able to beat everybody on every single specification on the product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Can you mention the synergies with Volterra? Can you maybe talk about how OpEx should trend after this quarter? And then also, maybe talk about your expectations of Volterra growth versus core Maxim growth after this quarter? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure, I'll handle the OpEx, and let Tunc talk about sort of the long-term Volterra growth. As you know, we've identified about $15 million worth of annualized synergies that we should be able to achieve. I think we feel very confident we're on track for that. We probably got about half of that achieved in the current quarter. It's offset a little bit by just some integration costs. But I think we're confident that we'll be able to achieve that $15 million annualized target after the March quarter. So from that point of view, that will provide a little bit of a down draft on our current OpEx. As far as the kind of organic Maxim business, we'll have to wait and see. Obviously, we don't have -- we've kind of made it through and Q2 is when we have the full quarter impact of our merit. And then going forward, obviously, you've seen us kind of being very good at managing and being disciplined in our OpEx. And certainly, we'll do that to the extent that we see opportunities for growth and our revenue and margin support it, we'll obviously continue to invest in the appropriate growth markets. Tunc Doluca : So on your other part of your question was in terms of top line of revenue. We do -- I've said this before, when we acquired the company in our justification, we don't really expect the revenue to grow for the next couple of years. Volterra products in the notebook market are basically going down, and that was a result of Volterra management basically reducing the amount of investment in that space, and that's offset by growth in some of their Comms and their Server business. So we know going in that for the next 2 or 3 years, there's really not that much growth in the opportunity. But there is, because of wins that we believe we can get, they have very small penetration in the communications market, and their products are very applicable there. But as you know, when you win those designs, it really takes 2 or 3 years for them to begin to show up as revenue. So that's -- in that space, it's going to take a while. And there were 3 other growth factors, I had mentioned. It was solar space, the integrated voltage regulators, as well as some battery products. And those 2 will take about 2 or 3 years to become sizable revenue. So we're -- now that we're more into and see the business better since the acquisition got completed, we basically see that, that's -- that plan is -- continues to be valid. And essentially, that's the drumbeat that we're marching to as a company. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And for my follow-up, Tunc, I'd just be interested in your opinion, if we to sort of x out the volatility of Samsung, what's your opinion on what's going on in semis right now. Are we in a normal seasonal environment? Are we taking a bit of a breather here, and we're below seasonal, and anything you can give us on just the overall demand environment and why? Tunc Doluca : Well, I think every company is kind of seeing -- it's almost like many of the companies are on some different cycles than what happened. It's like if we take out mobility, which obviously for us has a huge effect, we, too, see some seasonality in reduction, for instance, in industrial market for this quarter. But we are investing in some of the other markets, the vertical markets, which kind of have their own pattern. So that's really changing the results that we're getting in terms of our revenue going quarter-over-quarter. But I think in terms of what we're seeing, like in the industrial core space, it's really not that much different than what others are seeing. And I think that we're not -- there's no surprises in that core business from our point of view. But what we are seeing is some positive signs from our other markets, especially the vertical ones, and that's really helping us in terms of our results or our forecast for, especially, the December quarter being so different. Now having said that, we -- one piece of information that Bruce and I actually wanted to share was that, we, in general, the October, so far, bookings have been lower than the average booking rate that we saw in the prior quarter. And I really believe that, that is -- that's probably what's happening to our other competitors as well, and that probably has something to do with the guidance that everybody else has provided. When we look at historical data though, October usually is a weaker month than the prior quarter average. So from that point of view, it doesn't look like there is an alarmingly low level going on. But I think everybody has their own way of interpreting the data. And from our interpretation, that's how we came up with our guidance for the quarter, which appears to be higher than some of the peers -- peer companies that we compete with. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao from Bank of America. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Tunc, why has it been so hard to break into the other big smartphone vendor? You guys have best-in-class integration technology and content is also growing. Is it a pricing issue, or is it just hard to displace an incumbent at that customer? Tunc Doluca : Well, it's kind of hard to really completely take -- separate pricing from hard to replace an incumbent because they're always combined. But being an incumbent is always a better position to be in, and that's certainly something we enjoy at the other big customer. But it's not very easy unless the incumbent has some major flaw to completely displace them. But as we've said before, I mean, with the second customer, we also -- which we do have business with them, we just don't disclose it, because they want to be very private and we respect the wishes of that customer. But we do have business with them, and we compete with other suppliers at that customer, and our revenues are significant. But obviously, they're not currently above the 10% level that we -- at which point we do have to report it. So we're working closely. We've got a good relationship. I have -- I believe that at some point in time, we're going to grow our revenues with the customer. But it is, as you pointed out, incumbents do have an advantage when they're in those sockets already. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Good. And then perhaps, one for Bruce. Bruce, could you provide some color on what's the current internal capacity on a revenues basis and what end-market products are manufactured in-house? And also is there a manufacturing node transition? I think you've been at, like the 0.18 node for like 3, maybe close to 4 years now, that you can make to kind of improve your cost competitiveness in mobile? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. So currently, I mean, we have -- with our flexible manufacturing model, and we have probably over $1 billion, right around $1 billion of quarterly capacity. Of course, that depends on sort of the mix of products that make that up. And from what we do internally and externally, we have 3 different foundry partners. And certainly, our newer technologies, for us, the 400-nanometer and the 180 are the ones that we can do externally. And in general, those are in the consumer and some of the computing space. But some of those do fall into other areas, like automotive, et cetera. And generally, our industrial products are done primarily internally. Our goal is to always be able to build products in multiple fabs, whether internally or externally, so that we have that flexibility to scale up to the extent that a certain market sees an uptick in demand. As far as the specific nodes, I'll let Tunc talk about that. Tunc Doluca : So the current workforce for most of our Consumer or Mobility business is, are 180-nanometer BCD processors. We did mention in the past that we're working on a newer generation of that, and I really expect that to qualify into production, probably next year some time. So it's definitely in the works, and it's coming. And we'll see a transition in the coming years, but 180-nanometer will be most of our revenue generator for awhile. Venk Nathamuni : Operator, given the time constraints, we'll go with just one question per caller, and if there's time at the end, they can always ask a follow-up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Tunc, just to follow on that last question, the 0.18, you said there's a new generation coming. Is that just an upgrade, and you're going to still be on that 0.18 node? Tunc Doluca : No, it's going to be finer line than 0.18. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Can you talk about what you guys are seeing out there in the market in terms of inventory outside of sort of your handset customers, and if you think those inventory levels are adequate at this point? Tunc Doluca : Bruce, you should take that one since distribution is you. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. Yes, I mean, I think we called out distribution actually went down, from 53 to 52. We actually did see a little bit of growth in absolute dollars in inventory. But resales more than offset that, right, resales were up 5%. And so from that point of view, the days actually went down by 1%. So I think the channel inventory continues to be lean. It just simply doesn't want to go up, and I think it's just because of folks continuing to -- we're looking at our distributors continuing to be cautious from an inventory build point of view. It keeps getting harder for us to check inventory levels in our ODMs and OEMs, alright. As these are large customers with manufacturing around the world, it's getting harder for us. So we're not aware of any inventory buildup at this time. But that said, I think it is harder for us to track that at the OEMs and ODMs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike McConnell from Pacific Crest Securities. Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Bruce, looking at something that stood out to me was the 3-month backlog. I think if we adjust for Volterra, it was up about 9% sequentially, which is definitely better than most of your peers and book-to-bill above 1. Could you kind of talk about what's driving the backlog? Is this just that industrial customer base, kind of calling for deliveries at a later time, or maybe some color there, please? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. I mean, I think as we went into the first quarter, right, I think backlog was low as we went through the inventory correction, certainly, at our largest customer. And so then as we entered the quarter, we had -- Tunc talked about how book-to-bill was greater than 1. And so that usually happens where you get some good bookings in the first quarter to really set up kind of the first couple of months in the second quarter. One thing though that you will see is, generally speaking, the turns in our second quarter historically have been less than in other quarters. And we've seen this trend, and that's for a couple of reasons. One, customers are doing shutdowns, managing their kind of year-end inventory level, and to the extent that our largest customer at some level will continue to manage their balance sheet as well in the month of December. So I think it's just -- we see the uptick in the backlog, obviously, compared to the prior quarter when business was declining. And we also see that this is a lower turns quarter. So it's typical to start up high and then come down. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just a follow-up on the Industrial business you guys have had, a lot of success in terms of driving your application-specific products. The question is, are there any big, new products coming out in that market? And if you have time, just a quick comment on Volterra, where you guys are seeing some synergies coming through, reducing some stuff, but at the same time you're saying you're going to be adding some resources there. So what's being added and what's being reduced? Tunc Doluca : So in terms of the industrial verticals, in terms of products, I think we talked about previously, where we're investing. I mean, we're investing in smart grid products and meters, and those products are coming. We've added capabilities in our newer generations to not only do the metrology but also do security, as well as the communications processing of the data. So lots of great technology in the works there and announced already. We've got products coming in the medical space. We've not announced any of these yet, but we're really making great products that can have -- that have a combination of measuring things very accurately, which is needed in medical. Plus, the ability to do extremely low-power micro-controllers on the same chip. We've got great technology that we actually recently announced for ultrasound, where we integrated multiple channels into a single package, really reduced the component count by an order of magnitude or more, and we've got newer generations of that coming. So there's plenty of products and technology in development in all these vertical markets, and I just gave you a few of the more visible examples in the recent past. Your question about Volterra was adding, and I didn't quite understand that last piece. You said there were synergies? And you said we also talked about adding more resources, I don't think we've said that. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I think you're saying Volterra will be able to leverage what's at Maxim, maybe that's just the sales force or something, but it seemed like you... Tunc Doluca : So most of that is, obviously, the Volterra, a very small sales force. They were very focused in terms of customers. And what we're really doing in terms of selling their products more effectively is just using our sales force. Remember, we're adding more people. We already had a very good coverage around the world, and we're going to make sure that we train our field employees so they can effectively sell the Volterra products to the customers. They already are visiting almost on a daily basis. So that's not additional resources. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division : Bruce and Tunc, I wanted to understand the revenue mix within the Consumer Mobile business across power sensors and audio, and get your view for how that mix could evolve over the course of next year. Tunc Doluca : Yes. It's something that we're pretty sensitive about and don't -- we prefer not to disclose that for various reasons. And the most important one for competitive reasons, and the second one is customers wouldn't really appreciate us talking about their -- about the price of these because they're pretty concentrated. So we don't break out how much of the revenues in each one of the functions. Is that your question, or did I misunderstand it? Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division : The question is just trying to -- and it wasn't trying figure out what's going on with your biggest customer. The question was getting at where you thought there could be growth inside the portfolio next year. So if you can't take that one, then the follow-up question would be, in the Medical business where you've got an inventory issue with one customer, what gives you confidence that it's just a normal inventory issue and not a market share issue? Tunc Doluca : Let me see. Bruce E. Kiddoo: So I'll take that one. On the medical side, that's really, obviously, we're able to track to the extent that they shift into various CMs, and this was just an example where they actually had brought on a second CM, right? And so there was just an initial kind of buildup of that. And now, we're just going to kind of normalize between those 2 CMs, the amount of inventory that each one is keeping. So from this point of view, we're confident from a socket point of view that we have the business, and this was just an inventory rebalancing as they brought on a second contract manufacturer. So I don't think there's too much worry there. And I would say just a little color on your earlier question. One of the challenges we have is, to the extent that we're doing integrated products at this point in time, it's actually getting harder now to separate out, I mean, I'll say, internally to say exactly how much we have in power versus audio versus interface. Those are the type of things that -- it's hard for us to even track that internally. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Bruce and Tunc, just thinking to the long-term operating model, what is the right way to think about it, because last time, you gave it to us when you had a big consumer ramp in front of you, and now that has slowed down. But the flip side is that your industrial and other businesses should grow. So longer term, not next year, but just 2 to 3 years out, what's the right way to think about it? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes. Good question. We still firmly believe in our model. And I think to the extent that we're at a 25% operating margin today, that actually provides a nice upside for us. We still believe in and target the kind of the 30% op margin number. We talked about earlier on the call, I think absolutely, the 61% to 64% gross margin is still our model. And you've kind of seen us demonstrate a lot of discipline around our OpEx. And so from that point of view, driving that number from where it currently is 35% of revenue, right, trying to get that down to something closer to 30% or 32% will provide additional leverage for us as well. So still, with our mix of business grow a little bit faster, 61%, 64% growth, manage the OpEx tight, and drive the kind of 30% op margin, which is a nice upside from today. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : A question on the Communications business. You mentioned that you're seeing a little bit of a rebound in telecom spending from China, and it's flowing through to your optical and also your PlayStation business. I was wondering for the -- for fiscal Q2 and maybe even further beyond this, if you have visibility, if you expect that to be a lumpy business as it's traditionally been? Or if you see a more steady consistent spending patterns going over the long term? Tunc Doluca : Yes. The fiber communications products that we sell in the markets that these go into, historically, have always been lumpy. We -- not only because of the spending being lumpy, but also we see lots of inventory in the channel fluctuating a lot, especially in the Optical Module business. So that's been in the past. And I think it'd be very similar in the future, I don't think the general dynamics in that market are going to change. So it's going to be lumpy just the way that you characterized it, in my view. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, operator. This concludes our Maxim Integrated conference call. We'd like to thank you for your participation and for your interest in Maxim Integrated. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Kathy Ta, Managing Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kathy. Kathryn Ta : Well, thank you, Jonathan, and welcome, everyone, to Maxim Integrated's fiscal second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Tun\u00e7 Doluca; and Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Kiddoo. Before we get into today's earnings announcements, I would like to invite everyone on the call to please save the date of Wednesday, May 21, 2014, for Maxim Integrated's Investor Day to be held in Boston.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Bruce. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Thanks, Kathy. It's great to have you on the Maxim team. I will review Maxim's second quarter financial results, which includes the results for Volterra. Revenue for the second quarter was $620 million, up 6% from the first quarter. The growth was due to the addition of Volterra, as our organic business was flat in line with our guidance. Our revenue mix by major market in Q2 was approximately 39% for Consumer; 28%, Industrial; 16%, Communications; and 17%, Computing. Our Consumer business declined due to the typical year-end inventory correction at our largest customer and weakness in home entertainment, offset by strength in tablets and e-readers. Our Industrial business was flat as continued growth in Automotive, up for the fourth consecutive quarter was offset by a seasonal decline in our core Industrial business. Our Communication business was up with strength in networking and Datacom and the addition of Volterra. Finally, our Computing business was up due to the Volterra acquisition. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items and warranty expense, was 61.1%, up slightly from 60.7% in the prior quarter, due to lower inventory reserves in Q2. We had $18 million in warranty expense in Q2, which had a 3-point impact on gross margin. This was primarily driven by a legacy design issue with a major customer. We have implemented corrective actions to prevent this issue from recurring. Historically, warranty expense has averaged around $250,000 per quarter over the last 4 years. Special items in Q2 gross margin were intangible asset amortization and inventory write-up from acquisitions, increasing from the prior quarter due to Volterra. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $226 million, up from $207 million in the prior quarter, due to Volterra and the impact of our annual merit increase and equity grants. Operating expenses were lower than expected as we continue to tightly control spending. I am pleased that we are ahead of schedule in achieving our $15 million target in annual operating synergies from Volterra and expect to achieve this target in Q3. Special items in Q2 operating expenses included acquisition-related and restructuring charges, again, the increase from the prior quarter primarily due to Volterra. Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items and warranty expense, was $152 million or 25% of revenue. Including warranty expense, operating income was $134 million or 22% of revenue. The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 20.3%, up from 17.3% in the prior quarter, primarily due to Volterra. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items and warranty expense, was $0.41, flat with the prior period. Including warranty expense, earnings per share was $0.36. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $234 million or 38% of revenue, up from the prior quarter due to repayment of our annual -- due to the payment of our annual employee bonus in the prior quarter. Inventory was 110 days, excluding special items, warranty expense and the Volterra inventory write-up to fair value, flat with the prior quarter. Inventory was 104 days excluding special items but including the favorable impact of the warranty expense and the Volterra inventory write-up. Inventory in the channel, excluding catalog distributors, decreased slightly from 52 to 51 days as channel inventory in dollar terms increased, but was more than offset by an increase in resales. Net capital additions totaled $37 million in Q2, down slightly from the prior quarter and at the midpoint of our target of 5% to 7% of revenue. The net payment for Volterra was $454 million, and the net proceeds of our bond offering was $494 million. We issued 5-year bonds with a coupon rate of 2.5%. Share repurchases totaled $59 million in Q2 as we bought back 2 million shares. We also paid $73 million in dividends to our shareholders. Overall, total return on capital for calendar year 2013 was 127% of free cash flow, in part due to higher share repurchases. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $115 million in the second quarter to $1.15 billion. Moving on to guidance. Our beginning Q3 backlog declined to $366 million. It is typical for our beginning backlog to decline in Q3 as our largest customer annually reduces inventory and bookings in Q2. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue of $590 million to $620 million. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is estimated at 60% to 62%. Q3 gross margin will be impacted by the lower utilizations in Q2 which impact gross margin on a quarter leg, offset by expected favorable mix and lower inventory reserves in Q3. Special items in Q3 gross margin are estimated at $23 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. This includes $5 million of inventory write-up related to the acquisition of Volterra, which is fully amortized in Q3 and does not repeat in Q4 or later quarters. Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be down approximately 2% due to continued tight spending controls. For Volterra, we expect to achieve our annual synergy target of $15 million in Q3 ahead of schedule. Special items in Q3 operating expenses are estimated at $5 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our Q3 cap rate, excluding special items, is estimated to be within our long-term range of 16% to 20%. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.37 to $0.41. Net capital expenditures in Q3 are expected to be down slightly from Q2 as we continue to lower our CapEx as a percent of revenue. We expect share repurchases in Q3 to be consistent with the prior quarter, adjusted for market conditions as appropriate. And finally, our Board of Directors has approved payment of a cash dividend of $0.26 per share, approximately a 3.6% yield at yesterday's closing stock price. I will now turn the call over to Tun\u00e7 to further discuss our business. Tunc Doluca : All right. Thank you, Bruce, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated, and thank you for joining us today. Every year, I spend time visiting our global offices, discussing our company direction and strategy with employees and soliciting their inputs. Today, I happened to be joining you from Munich. Bruce and Kathy are at our headquarters in San Jose. As 2014 gets underway, we are seeing growing design win momentum in our Consumer and Automotive businesses. These markets were certainly showcased at the recent CES show in Las Vegas where highly integrated, small form factor and low power solutions appeared in mobile devices, wearables and new automotive applications. In addition to our momentum in these areas, I'm very pleased with our progress in integrating Volterra Semiconductor. As Bruce mentioned, we are ahead of our schedule in achieving operational and financial synergies. Volterra's employees have already moved into our San Jose headquarters, and as our engineers begin to work together, we're seeing many ways in which Volterra's high current power management technology and expertise is enabling Maxim to enjoy significant time-to-market advantage in enterprise and communications applications. Let me now discuss the results for the December quarter. We achieved good revenue performance in our December quarter despite a soft industry environment. We exercise good spending discipline, and I would like to thank our team here at Maxim for good execution in the quarter. So let me update you on lead times and bookings. Our delivery lead times increased slightly but still remained at our 4-week model. Customer order lead times were flat from the prior quarter. Bookings decreased during the December quarter due to an inventory correction in the consumer market as expected. So I will next provide some color on our major markets. Let me start with Consumer as customary. We expect our March quarter consumer end market revenue to be down significantly with March being a seasonally soft quarter for Mobility products outside of our largest customer. We expect this seasonality to be partially offset by the beginning of a new platform brand at our largest customer. Current indications are that our content will increase in the new platform. We are diversifying our exposure within the Mobility market in several ways. First, we're growing our revenue and content in the midrange smartphone market with significant growth in China. Our success here has been driven by the technology, design IT and systems expertise that we developed for high-end smartphones that has now become a requirement in midrange phones as their feature set becomes richer. Second, we continue to expand our technology offerings for mobile devices. Our portfolio of mobility products includes power management, optical sensor, MEMS, audio amplifier and touch products. We assume momentum in the technology roadmap in the audio amplifier space and in the quarter, received our first order for our next-generation audio amplifiers at a major customer. We continue to develop sensors for new applications. Our high integration interface power system-on-a-chip remains best-in-class and a customized version of this product continue to be designed in at multiple customers. Third, we are expanding beyond smartphones with games in tablets and e-readers with a significant portion of this business diversified beyond our leading customer. And finally, wearable devices such as smartwatches are a logical next step in the mobility roadmap, which plays to our strengths in highly integrated small form factor and low power solutions. Let me next turn to the Industrial market. Our differentiated strategy in Industrial where we generate roughly half our business from targeted vertical ASSP markets continues to serve us well. We predict March quarter industrial revenue to be up strongly, driven by growth in Automotive, favorable seasonality in our core Industrial business and strength in medical applications. In Automotive, we see broad-based ramps in infotainment and LED lighting applications. Year-over-year, we have grown the number of automotive design wins in our pipeline and have seen the majority of our growth coming from new products. Our highly integrated medical products, which address ultrasound, blood oximeter and blood glucose measurements, are gaining traction. We're excited about the growing need for portable, low power, and biomedical monitoring devices in medical markets. Let me now provide some commentary on our Distribution business. Days of inventory was 51 days at the end of the December quarter versus 52 days at the end of the September quarter. These low levels of inventory appear to be the new normal in our industry, and we see strong end market bookings in our distribution channels. I would like to note that distribution resales and end market bookings placed on our distributors were both up 5%, sequentially, in the December quarter. Now, let me discuss Communications. We project Communications revenue to increase in the March quarter. We're seeing an uptick in our fiber optics and base station businesses related to the 4G LTE infrastructure rollout in China. We also see growth in our small cell business driven by market traction of consumer femtocells. Overall, we're focused on executing our strategy of delivering highly integrated solutions to the communications market, enabling broader coverage, increased capacity and lower cost of ownership to deploy the networks of the future. In the Computing market, revenues are expected to be down significantly in the March quarter due to an expected decline in the notebook business and some softness from U.S. OEM companies selling servers in China. With Volterra, we're seeing the high density, efficient power management solutions are increasingly critical in servers, storage and a broad range of applications. And we're excited about the potential of this technology roadmap. To summarize our view for the March quarter, we expect revenue from the Industrial market to increase, led by automotive applications and seasonally higher core industrial sales. We expect Consumer to be down with seasonal softness, partially offset by our shipments for a new generation smartphone from our leading customer. Communications is expected to grow from fiber optic infrastructure buildout and base station deployment, and Computing is expected to be down over the period. In closing, we remain well positioned for growth across a broad range of markets. Our business model remains very attractive and our strong profitability allows us to return a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders. We will continue to focus on delivering winning products and technologies that provide highly differentiated solutions to our customers. Kathy, I'll now turn the call back to you. Kathryn Ta : Thanks, Tun\u00e7. That concludes our prepared remarks and we would now welcome your questions. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan, please begin polling for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of been Blayne Curtis, Barclays. Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Research Division : This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. First off, could you guys talk a little bit about how Volterra did in the quarter? Last quarter, you disclosed the revenues. Any color on what contribution they had this quarter? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes. This is Bruce. I'll take that question. So we highlighted in the press release that our revenue was at $35 million which was, in essence, flat with the prior quarter. As expected, we saw the server business up a little bit and offset by the expected decline in the notebook business. We feel good about the integration. As I indicated, we're ahead of schedule on achieving our $15 million in synergies. We expect to achieve that this quarter, in the March quarter, which is a quarter ahead of our original plan. And as Tun\u00e7 indicated, from a business and technology point of view, we've moved the team into our headquarters here and they're already starting to work with the different product lines and kind of distributing that Volterra technology across the company. So I think from a finance point of view, operational point of view and technology point of view, we feel good about Volterra and believe it's on track. Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Very helpful, thanks. Just a quick follow-up then. So you talked a bit about diversifying away from purely handsets. What percentage of revenue were smartphones during the quarter, and I guess, could you talk about the trajectory of how tablets and e-readers become a little more -- or a greater share of your overall revenue? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. I'll handle the first one and I'll let Tun\u00e7 talk about the second one. So cell phones were about 30% of revenue in the quarter. When we add in the handheld devices, we're probably at about 35% of revenue for the quarter, which is down from when we were in the kind of the high 30s to 40% range as we have continued to, a, this is a light quarter for our largest customer and we've had the continued growth in Industrial. But Tun\u00e7, maybe you can give some more color there. Tunc Doluca : So, I think your question was really what's our projection for tablets as we try to grow other product areas than smartphones on our revenue base. So we've been participating within the top mobile ecosystem players in both tablets and e-readers. In particular, we've won sockets in power management, overvoltage protection, fuel gauges and audio amplifiers in these applications. And we really see a great momentum in the technology roadmap in the audio amplifiers space. And the quarter received, actually, our first orders for next-generation audio amplifiers at a major customer. So we're -- I'm quite pleased with the fact that we're growing our revenue coming from tablets and e-readers, which we consider pretty similar in terms of the way they're built. And we really look forward to growing this revenue even further in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess, just to characterize the weakness at your largest customer, if you could just talk -- give a little of granularity on how much of that is just end market related, in other words, the sell-through of the product versus them still having too much inventory in certain SKUs. And I know some of that is circular, but if you could give us some color there. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Thanks, Jim. So I think in the -- when you say the weakness, so I think it was the December quarter. We saw the expected inventory correction. I think it was a little bit more than we thought. I think we thought Samsung was going to -- and I think we gave guidance that Samsung was going to be flat for the quarter. And they did end up being down slightly. And again, I think that was on some of the newer products where I think they were managing their inventory a little bit more than we thought. When we look at the March quarter, I think, as Tun\u00e7 stated, in the current indication, that our unit content will go up kind of on the new platform versus the S4. Of course, we can't give any more detail until that phone is announced. But I do think it's also reasonable, I mean, again, indications are, that, that ramp will probably be late in the quarter. And that it may be even more major than last year as they kind of learned from experience. So I think our view is, I wouldn't characterize our -- that business as a weakness. I think it's doing very well. We feel good about how we're positioned, how we're growing both in the high end and in kind of their midrange phones and in their tablets. So I think we feel good about that business going into calendar year '14. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's very helpful. If I could ask my follow-up on that point. Obviously, the market's been very concerned with your content coming down in some flagship phones. And obviously, this is a good indication that the content's actually going up in some of the important SKUs. Can you give any more granularity about which specific products you're seeing the content increase in? Tunc Doluca : Actually, no. Until the product's really announced by our end customers, it's really something that they'd like us not to comment on specifically. So we're not going to be able to give any color on what it is until they do announce the product. And then obviously, the teardown will tell everybody what's in there and what our content of revenue's coming from. So, sorry, but until then, we can't really talk about exactly what functions we have inside the phone. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Tun\u00e7, I guess, my first question, I know there's a lot of variables that go into this. But given where you're starting out the year in consumer/smartphones and kind of the trajectory you see throughout the year, do you think this is a year, '14, where you can get back to a resumption of growth for the full calendar year in consumer/smartphones? Tunc Doluca : So we actually feel good that adding new customers' content and platforms will contribute to our growth in calendar year '14 from calendar year '13. We've got -- we're competing in new sensors and opportunities that the market hasn't yet seen. Having said that though, although I'm feeling positive about this calendar year, we can only provide guidance 1 quarter at a time. But the progress I'm seeing that we're making in our business units is very promising and we continue to expand our technology offerings and target market opportunities. In technologies, we are getting wins and obviously, in powers, continue to do so. But new wins in optical sensors, new wins in audio, as I mentioned, and although small, we are seeing some growth in our touch products. And we have, as I indicated previously on the tablet question, seen good growth in that area as well. So, we're -- all the right things are happening. But in terms of guidance, it's really not appropriate right now to tell us -- tell you exactly what '14 versus '13 is going to look like. But the indications are positive. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Thanks. And Tun\u00e7, I guess, as my follow-up, I want to talk a little bit about the communications end market. There's been a decent recovery over the last couple of quarters, but you're still well below kind of the peak quarterly run rates we saw at the end of 2010. I'm just kind of curious, there's been some read across about LTE China buildout finally starting to happen. How do you feel about the trajectory of the comms business from here, and I guess, what needs to happen to see that quarterly revenue run rate get back to sort of that high 120s to maybe even 140 level? Tunc Doluca : Well, I think that when you look at the explosive growth periods that -- when we look at that data, what we see is that much of that happened during the bounce back after the financial crisis or the Great Recession, whichever one you want to call it. We are participating in the 4G LTE rollout in China, basically through the optical and backhaul segments. And we've seen limited deployment so far of our outdoor LTE small cells, that was going to be another growth area that we were investing in. But we believe that service providers and carriers are in, really, their early stages of testing small cell deployments. So these are still early days and I know we've been saying that for a while, but that's the fact. And on the other hand, we do expect femtocell shipments to continue to grow, and Maxim has a leading market share here due to our ability to deliver the highest integration, lowest cost and high performance integrated CDMA or 3G femtocell transceivers. But in essence, those explosive growth rates that we saw were in a period where the whole market was really growing very rapidly after almost 1.5 years or 2 years of little to no investment by the service providers. So I think we're well positioned and sometimes, the question also is asked about base stations. But base stations are too small of a percentage of our revenue, so they don't really have a huge effect on Maxim overall. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi. Amanda Scarnati : This is Amanda Scarnati for Terence Whalen. I just have a question on gross margin. What are the considerations that we should look for, for Volterra in the future for gross margin and are there any changes for the long-term model at this point? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. So Volterra free acquisition was about 58%, I think, in their last quarter. And as you know, we don't break out gross margins by our various end markets. And so, kind of going forward, we won't be doing that for Volterra either. What we -- I think it is fair to say that this is a -- there's a product mix changing right where the notebook business is going to go down and that should be supplemented by the server and in longer-term, by the Communication business. And so, I think, long term, our expectations are that, that gross margin will increase over time and be kind of right in the range of the corporate average of 61% to 64%. Amanda Scarnati : Great. And then also on Volterra, are there any new market share projections for this server business given the upcoming Intel platform changes? Tunc Doluca : Yes. Actually, we're -- as Bruce said, we're -- we kind of don't want to break out exactly what our product line shares are. So it will be reported in the future as part of our mostly Computing, and we are investing so that we can also grow the communication sector. But the design win momentum has been good and there's new processor models that are ramping in the near future, it actually have started already. So the content is good for the Volterra products. But just cautioning you for the future, we really aren't going to break out our market share in the server market particularly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : It looks like Computing is the biggest drag on revenue share in the March quarter, the other businesses are up or at least better than seasonal. Can you quantify -- I'm assuming this is tied to Volterra's notebook business. Could you just quantify for us how big that business is and what sort of headwind it might be for revenues in calendar '14? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes. I think it is partly due to the Volterra notebook business, Romit. And I think in the past, right, that's been about a 20% or so of the business and it's declining over time, certainly. The other thing is we do have some legacy Computing business that -- and we have some kind of old TV monitor kind of business that is also slowly declining. And that's been declining over time, and we actually just -- in the March quarter, there's a step function where a couple of those old designs are going end-of-life. And so that's probably equally contributing to that decline in the Compute business in the third quarter. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : So Bruce, if you just add the Volterra piece and some of this TV revenue together, what is it as a percentage of sales? Bruce E. Kiddoo: So as we reported, for this quarter, Computing was at 17%, including the Volterra piece. So in the past, I think, last quarter it was around 12%, Romit. So you can see that's increased it by about 5 points. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : So is it fair to say then that somewhere between 5% to 10% of revenues will decay or go to 0 over time? Bruce E. Kiddoo: No, I think that's too high of a number. We can talk offline, but I think if you look at the -- kind of the Volterra number, right, if you look at 20% of $35 million, right, that sum number, $7 million, that will slowly decline and I think our experience is that, that decline is slower than people think. There are these products, the product lines that sort of linger on. So I think that market, that amount will slowly decline, but I think that's less than the percentages you said. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Evan Wang - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : This is Evan Wang calling for Tore. I like to first ask about your Automotive business. It sounded like it's a big growth portion of your industrial. I'm wondering if you can give us some more color. Help us to understand your business here, including what percentage of revenue and where your products are being used. Tunc Doluca : So on the Automotive side, I'll take that in reverse order. We don't currently break out what percentage of our revenue is in Automotive. But we have grown significantly over the past 6 or 7 years. I think that we said that it was about 1% or so maybe 7 years ago. And today, it's approaching the high single-digits type numbers. So obviously, that's been a great growth story for the company. But the types of products that we sell, which was the other question that you asked, really is in -- it's pretty broad, but it's mostly focused on automotive infotainment, products like for radio and TV tuner products on the RF side, as well as other products for power management, infotainment applications. We also have distribution of video content, which are serializer-deserializer product line that's been very successful especially in high-end cars. Obviously -- and good traction we're seeing now in our Keyless Go products. These are for RF Keyless Go products, both on the key side and also on the car itself. And we also see revenue coming in from other applications for battery charging and monitoring ICs in the future. So these are basically our invest areas in the company. In terms of infotainment, we also have very rugged, well-protected USB interface products that most of the cars now are beginning to have because of all of us want to plug in our smartphones or our music players in there. So it's pretty broad-based, but it's -- I think the future really looks good because the product lives are long. And each, since we're beginning -- since we began more recently basically, because of that, every new design-in is adding up on top of old revenues, which are still in their -- in the stages where they're continuing and not falling off yet. So I see this opportunity as a great opportunity for the company to grow its revenues in the future as well. Evan Wang - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I also like to ask about your diversification effort in your Mobility business, and you named 2 potential drivers for that. One is the, I guess, diversifying your customer base into others. The other is just giving to more different types of products like tablets and -- which do you think will be a more important driver for you in this year or in the quarters to come? Tunc Doluca : Actually, there was a third one that you missed. And the third one was to diversify the types of products that we sell, meaning technologies that we sell. And I think from my point of view, all of these are going to have a contribution. So it's really difficult for me to quantify which one will, but all 3 will help us this year in our diversification. As I outlined in my prepared comments, we are getting new customers and that's helping us diversify. We have been selling into products other than smartphones, namely tablets and e-readers and so on. And those are -- many of those design wins are outside of our major customer. And finally, we're getting traction with our other products. Our optical sensor products, our audio products have been very successful. So it's really tough for me to name which of those 3 areas are going to be the biggest contributors. So I'm going to say all 3 are going to be contributors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Same sort of question in the consumer side, for either Turc or Bruce. I believe in the past you said you expected consumer to grow this calendar year or it might have been just your Mobility business so, I guess, the first thing, if you could clarify on that point. And then if you could just help us walk through a general sense how that would work because it does seem like you'd have to have some pretty massive sequentials built in later this year, if it is in fact for the consumer segment as a whole that you expect to grow. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes, Ross, this is Bruce. I'll take the first half of this. But the statement that we made before was that, and this was back in either June or September, around we did expect Mobility to return to growth and certainly, that view was more on a sequential basis versus the year-over-year. I don't think we ever tried to -- we're not -- our crystal ball isn't that good to be able to forecast out in time, but I think we were confident that what we saw in the summer was more of an inventory correction and that are positioning now based on all the things that Tun\u00e7 has talked about from a design win point of view in different customers, different technologies, different platforms, market segment. Allow us to have that confidence. And so I think from that point of view, that's where we make that. I think, like you said, whether it's a year-over-year depending on we really had a strong March last year, which everybody is aware, was an over shipment and then some corrections. So I think we feel good about the business. I think we do feel like we're going to return to growth. But I don't know if it's going to be -- exactly come out from a year-over-year. As Tun\u00e7 said, we feel good going into the year and it's up for us to execute now. Tunc Doluca : So Ross, let me just add some more color to that. Bruce is absolutely right. Obviously, we printed some pretty strong quarters last year, last calendar year, but we also had some weak quarters as well in that same calendar year period. So if you -- if we look at how we see calendar year '14 developing, if you average the weaks and the strongs last year, we should be able to get back to growth in this market. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. Thanks for the clarification on this. That's very helpful. Then my second question is moving over to the OpEx side. Bruce, you said you're 1 quarter ahead of plan on the integration and the synergies with Volterra. Is the way we're supposed to take that, the down 2% on OpEx that you have, I think that gets you somewhere in the low 220s on a dollar basis. Is that the new base from which you'd go up or down linked to revenue like Maxim traditionally does or is there any other steps left in the integration that we should build into OpEx? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Now I think like you said, that low 220s is where that comes in. That's a good number and I think we're going to continue to look for synergies within Volterra and within our own product lines from that point of view. So we continue to manage that. But I think it's fair to say on a material point of view, this is a good base line in which we're going to try to manage OpEx vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth. And so I think we feel good. In a quarter that's seasonally down, we are able to reduce OpEx in line with that seasonally down quarter. But certainly, we'll continue to manage it and as we get into the quarters where generally we have stronger growth, we'll manage OpEx to grow slower than that revenue growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Tun\u00e7, on the wireless side, as the high end of the market potentially slows or at least decelerates, do you think the mid-end piece could become a bigger piece of your overall business as you go forward? And can you talk about just kind of a dollar content differential between those segments? Tunc Doluca : Sure. I assume by wireless, you're not -- you didn't mean communications. You meant smartphones, correct? Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes, that's right. Tunc Doluca : Okay. So on the smartphone side, essentially what we're seeing is that we can take the great technology that we've developed for high-end smartphones and take those products and really adjust them for the requirements of the midrange market and sell them. And in terms of the content, obviously, in a midrange phone, there is less content in analog and mixed signal than in a high-end smartphone. However, interestingly enough, what we're seeing is that many of these features that were not found in midrange phones are beginning to migrate to them in terms of what end users are asking. And that's giving us great opportunities to be able to win those types of design. But the dollar content is less because some of the functions simply don't exist. So it's -- it doesn't -- it's not there. But the functionality that we provide, especially in our high-integration products and some of our other products that we sell, is required in those. From a profitability standpoint, actually, they're not much different from a margin profile standpoint. So we've been able to take these blocks and in some cases, really put the right feature sets in them to be able to win designs in the midrange. And these opportunities are actually coming to us, not only it's our major customers today, but obviously, they're also coming in a lot of the Chinese customers. And we look -- it looks really positive in terms of getting these wins and adding revenue and diversifying our revenue base into the midrange. Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. On the commentary about strength of bookings orders, can you provide any more context to that in terms of how things ended the quarter and then the start of this quarter and any differences by some of the geographies? Bruce E. Kiddoo: I'll take that. So I think in the December quarter, as traditional bookings slowed down, and so that's normal for us, right, and we usually enter the quarter with a low backlog and then going into that. And then as we get into the quarter, we start to see strength in bookings as kind of the new platform of our customers starts to pick up. So I think, overall, I think bookings are coming in as expected and certainly support the guidance that we've provided. I think from an end market point of view, we normally talk about that. Our only view into that is really through distribution. And there, we actually saw both end market bookings and resales up 5% sequentially. And if we kind of break that down, we saw good end market bookings and resales in Asia. Primarily, we're selling into consumer products [Audio Gap] design wins from a mobility point of view, both in China and Taiwan. And so we saw good bookings and turns for seasonal resales. I think in the Industrial side, we saw resales down in the U.S. and Europe in kind of a seasonally low period, but we saw good end market bookings in the U.S. and Europe, which should lead to the seasonally up resales in the March quarter. So fundamentally, Consumer, good end market bookings, turns, resales in December; Industrial, in Europe and U.S., low -- good end market bookings supporting resales in the March -- expected resales increase in March. Kathryn Ta : Jonathan, just in the interest of getting to everyone in the queue, we have about 15 minutes left, so I'd like to limit everyone to just one question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from JPMorgan. Shaon Baqui - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : This is actually Shaon Baqui calling on behalf of Chris. Now that you're in the progress of integrating Volterra, can you rank order your end markets in terms of growth going forward? Tunc Doluca : I think that rank order, that's something that I don't really have in front of me. I think the best way to answer that question is maybe for you to join our Investor Day in May, and we'll be able to give a much more detailed view of how we see going forward. But I think in general, the growth areas that we see for the company, obviously, we have been talking a lot about Automotive. I think that continues to be a great growth area, not only because the content's going up, but because we're coming from a lower base. So I think that's going to continue to grow. And I've visited some of our Automotive customers while in Europe and I see -- really see good design win momentum at these major customers here. So that's one area that is very positive. We're doing the right things in the Mobility space. So I believe that, that's going to be another good growth area. Industrial has been doing well because of our ASSP strategy. So if you ask me to pick our most favored child, it'll be tough for me to do, but it's really all of these are doing really good momentum. But we'll give a lot more detail of all that in May. So please join us then. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just on the diversification theme. On the handset side, you talked about gains in the middle tier. Can you share with us any data which points to the fact that you are actually making progress, whether it's your mix of that segment on a year-over-year basis. And then longer term, what's the right way to think about Maxim's end market mix? And then -- not this year, I'm talking 2 to 3 years out. Tunc Doluca : So let me take that in reverse order. In terms of our end market mix, we really don't put that down as an absolute goal. We want all of our organizations to be aggressive and win business and grow the company going forward. So I won't be able to give you color about what our mix is going to be in 3 years. In terms of how -- evidence that we're doing well in our diversification, I believe that you're going to see this more going into the next year, but we're definitely growing in our Chinese customer base, for example, and they're almost doubling every year for the -- in the last couple of years and projections for this year, albeit it's from a lower base. So it's not comparable to Samsung, but we've definitely seen that. And we're also seeing good revenue growth and design wins that you've actually already seen in tear-downs at the other Tier 1 supplier. So definitely, I mean these are things that show that we are succeeding in terms of being able to win at other customers other than our largest one. And as I said, we're doing the right things and we're seeing the evidence that it really is happening. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Susquehanna Financial. Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just a question with regard to the Consumer business and the outlook for the March quarter. Last year, during the transition between some legacy products and some of the new products, you saw some headwind as those legacy products declined. Should we assume that with the inventory adjustments that happened in the December quarter that, that's fairly behind us? We wouldn't expect that to happen this year. And perhaps you could just give a little more color about the items within the Consumer part of your revenue that are seeing the headwind as you go into the March quarter? Tunc Doluca : Okay. So in terms of the inventory corrections you referred to last year, which was corrections in S III in 1 quarter followed by corrections in S4 in the next quarter. In terms of our conservatism, we're really looking at what our customer's telling us in terms of what's required. And I think the demands from us have really been moderated. So I don't -- we're not expecting a repeat of what happened last year. Now having said that, we really don't know what the uptake of the new products or the new platform we talked to you about that's beginning builds by the end of this quarter. But it's -- the picture -- the forecast picture looks different than -- definitely different than what it was in 2013. So I think that we have a model that's more modest right now. And that's the way that we're building our manufacturing model. So what was -- you had another question in there that I would like to answer, too. Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : The components within the Consumer business that are declining in the March quarter. Tunc Doluca : Okay. So in the March quarter, essentially, the components are most of the other segments other than this new platform that is going to be ramping, we expect towards the end of this quarter. So if you look at it, it's pretty much all of them coming out of the holiday seasonality. They're mostly all declining. And the one that we're looking forward to beginning to go up is the new platform launch by our largest customer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao from Bank of America. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I want to take another stab at Ambrish's question earlier. So as you look ahead over the course of 2014, I mean, do you expect more revenue contribution from the flagship models you're traditionally associated with? Or could you be seeing more growth from midrange phones where volumes are higher and make up for lower dollar content? Tunc Doluca : Okay. So the calendar year over calendar year, I think when we look at our future, I think that we are projecting, and it's really difficult to give a lot of accuracy in this thing because there's many variables that go into it. We don't really know the market uptake of the models that these customers make and so on. And -- but our expectation is that we are going to see revenue growth because of the plan that we put in place last year at customers other than our #1 customer for sure. So if you kind of look at that statement, it tells you that the growth coming from those is going to be more than the growth that we are planning for in the flagship models from our Tier 1 -- our #1 customer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike McConnell from Pacific Crest Securities. Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Tunc, I was a little bit surprised, I guess, during your commentary just not a lot of discussion about SensorDynamics. And on the sensor side of that push, you seem to be a little bit more bullish on the audio amps, but I wanted to see if that's correc,t, one, and how SensorDynamics is doing. What the landscape looked like competitively for you this year and at what point will you look at maybe possible integration of sensors into the interface SoC? Tunc Doluca : Okay. So yes, I didn't have much comments in there, so thank you for the question. It gives me a chance to give you an update. So certainly, the audio revenue has grown more rapidly than, obviously, the motion sensor side. But just to give you a color about where we're at, we have successfully brought up the MEMS technology internally, which was a big challenge, and our team did a good job of improving the yields and being able to show that we can make these repeatably. We did develop our first 3-degree of freedom products last year. And we introduced them almost about a year ago and those are shipping in low volume to a customer. And we're really well on our way on our 6-degree of freedom product, which is the one that is really required for most of the Mobility markets. We've kind of turned down our expectations relative to what I was saying a year ago. The main reasons are, we focused our development on our product providing a much better accuracy and stability on our parts and this was recognized by our customers. Actually, they did comment that we had the best product in terms of stability of the part itself. However, we didn't -- we're not able to beat our customers on every single spec. So that was kind of a -- put the brakes on the customer's switching to a new supplier. So in that situation, the incumbent is obviously more advantaged if you don't provide advantage in pretty much all of the specs. So having that input from the field, we actually have gone and made adjustments to our products and we will come back and show these new products to our customers again very shortly. And after that, we'll see where it goes. But I do know that we've achieved quite a bit in a short time. But in terms of revenue contributions, what I said last year of getting appreciable revenue contribution this year is not going to happen. It looks like there might be some towards the end of the year, but it certainly has been delayed because we were not able to achieve all of the specs that our customers wanted. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Bruce, you mentioned you're ahead of schedule on the expense synergies on Volterra. Can you review to the extent you believe that there's an opportunity for top line synergies in Volterra? And how does that mechanism happen? Is it just merely a matter of putting Volterra parts in the hands of a larger sales force or is there opportunity to leverage technology integration between Volterra and the organic Maxim products? And if you have a product, the new set of products in the sales force's hands last quarter, how long does that take to translate into production revenues? Tunc Doluca : So let me take that one. So when we did -- when we announced the acquisition, we had mentioned and we were pretty transparent that the Volterra revenues would really not grow for a couple of years, and it would take us a while for the synergies in terms of our being able to sell the products more effectively. It would take a while just because of the question you asked, if you do get design wins this year in these types of markets, servers and communications markets and enterprise and so on, it does take 2 or 3 years for that revenue to be able to ramp up. So we knew that going in. However, the Volterra product line was really undersold around the world because of their limited resources. And we certainly do have a sales force in every continent where there can be design wins now. And that's going to be a contributor to get more design wins, number one. Number two, because Volterra was a small company, they were pretty much blocked out of some of the customers because, too risky, because they are a small company. And we pretty much opened the door at many of the major communications companies, whether it be datacom or whether it be wireless infrastructure-type companies. So certainly, from a design win standpoint, that's going to help. But I have to say that it does -- in these markets, it takes a while. It's not quite like the Mobility market, where you can affect revenues next year. But we look at the product line and we talked to these customers, and they really do like the technology that Maxim has been able to add with the acquisition. So we have to be patient. But this is the type of the market we're in. Once we win those designs, they will pay dividends for a long time. So it's the type of business that we do like, but it will take a while. Kathryn Ta : Jonathan, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Tunc, you talked a little bit about an increase in magnitude of dollar content on your platform with your major customer. Can you give some sense of how large that is. Is it single-digit percent increase, larger or maybe double-digit increase? And then just in terms of -- I know you can't talk about specifically what parts you have on there, but can you talk about if there's been any change on the next-generation phone relative to what you've had in the past? Tunc Doluca : It's too bad this is the last question where we actually can't answer the question. Yes, as I said, the current indications are that our content will increase in this new platform. But until the products really come out into the market, we can't talk about the functions. And even when the products do come out, we don't talk about selling prices or dollar content in general because that gives away competitive information, and we're not going to be able to do that even then. But we're going to be very happy to talk about what those functions are once the tear-downs are out, and why we won them and why we have opportunities, even more opportunities going forward in these smartphones. So, sorry, but I won't be able to give you the information that you're seeking. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. Is it all right to sneak one more or are we done? Tunc Doluca : Well since I didn't answer that one, yes, you can sneak one in. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. Just in terms of your overall discussions around being more fully integrated company than some of your competitors out there, can you talk about -- internally you guys have talked about the fact that you need to have better functional blocks relative to everybody else in order to do that integration. I mean, certainly, if I go to your competitors, they're going to argue they have the best functional blocks. So how do you go about making sure you do have the better, best functional blocks in each area and what gives you confidence that you actually do have the leadership there? Tunc Doluca : Yes. I mean, we certainly do. The analog field clearly has many respectable companies that are good at some of these blocks that are required in these high integration products. I think that the thing that's really unique about Maxim is that we certainly do have great engineers that have developed very competitive and very innovative functional blocks for the parts. But when we talk about integration and putting these larger chips together, you do need more than just some functional blocks. First of all, you need a pretty broad IP portfolio. And when we look at many of our customers, you don't see the breadth that Maxim has got. What I mean by that is you need to be able to do all kinds of products, power supplies and audio products. You need to be able to do data converters and signal conditioning chips. You need to be able to integrate embedded microcontrollers. So when you make a table and say all of these are required and we've done this, you can see where many of the competitors fall out because they don't have this function or that function. So that's number one, breadth of IP. The second one is that you really need engineering trains to be able to put these complex chips together and that requires many years of changing the way you design these chips. It requires very advanced design -- electronic design automation tools. So we've invested in all that to make our designs go faster than our competitors. And we -- our customers tell us that in terms of our agility and in terms of being able to put these chips, high-performance chips together, we're doing very well compared to the rest of the industry. And finally, you do need very good understanding of the markets to do this very effectively. That means that you need to be thinking not along the lines of technologies, but along the lines of the markets that you're trying to serve. And that really requires you to be organized in a way that you're looking at a market rather than looking at the technology. And those are other -- that's another change that we have successfully gone through in the past 5 years. So if you combine all of those, you can see that the number of competitors that can do all of that is pretty limited. I'm not saying it's none. Of course, there are very capable competitors. But when you make -- when we make our tables, we can see that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of this customer demand for higher integration solutions for the equipment they're making. Kathryn Ta : Thank you for that last question, Steve. So this concludes Maxim Integrated's conference call. We would like to thank you for your participation and for your interest in Maxim. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Kathy Ta : Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome, everyone, to Maxim Integrated's fiscal third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Tun\u00e7 Doluca; and Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Kiddoo. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, I'd like to remind you that these statements must be considered in conjunction with the cautionary warnings that appear in our SEC filings. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this call involve risks and uncertainty, and that future events may differ materially from the statements made. For additional information, please refer to the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, which are posted on our website or available from the company without charge. Now I'll turn the call over to Bruce. Bruce Kiddoo : Thanks Kathy. I will review Maxim's third quarter financial results. Revenue for the third quarter was $606 million, down 2% from the second quarter in line with our guidance. Our revenue mix by major market in Q3 was approximately 38% from Consumer, 31% Industrial, 17% Communications and 14% Computing. Our Consumer business declined due to normal seasonality, partially offset by the initial ramp of a new smartphone at our largest customer. Our Industrial business was up strongly, with continued growth in Automotive and signaled strength in our core industrial business. In Automotive, we saw broad-based ramps in infotainment and LED lighting applications. Our Communication business was up, with strength in base stations due to the China 4G LTE rollout and cable infrastructure products. Finally, our Computing business was significantly down as expected, due to our server and notebook business, with server market weakness at major U.S. OEMs and the decline of our notebook business. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items was 60.1%, down from 61.1% excluding warranty expense in the prior quarter, due to lower fab utilization in Q2 and higher inventory reserves in Q3. Special items in Q3 gross margin were intangible asset amortization and inventory write-up from acquisitions. Operating expenses excluding special items were $222 million, down from $226 million in the prior quarter, due to additional cost synergies from Volterra, and lower spending across double categories, as we continue to tightly control spending. The decline in OpEx matched the decline in revenue. For Volterra, in Q3, we beat our annual synergy target of $15 million. Special items in Q3 operating expenses, included acquisition related and restructuring charges. Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items was $142 million or 23% of revenue. Q3 other income, included $17 million in IP licensing income, net of expenses. This was from an ongoing licensing program and was much higher than in prior quarters. We are now able to predict contributions from IP licensing in future quarters, if any. The Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 18.3%, down from 20.3% in the prior quarter. Special items in the Q3 tax rate, included a $35 million credit, related to a more favorable tax treatment for depreciation of fixed assets. GAAP earnings per share excluding special items was $0.43, up from $0.41 in the prior period, excluding warranty expense. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow; during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $212 million or 35% of revenue. Inventory was 109 days, excluding special items, down slightly from the prior quarter. Inventory in the channel, excluding catalog distributors, decreased from 51 to 49 days, as channel inventory in dollar terms decreased. Net capital additions totaled $25 million in Q3, down from the prior quarter, and at 4% of revenue, below our target of 5% to 7% of revenues. Share repurchases totaled $51 million in Q3, as we bought back 1.7 million shares. We also paid $73 million in dividends to our shareholders. Year-to-date for this fiscal year, we have returned over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $81 million in the quarter to $1.23 billion. Moving on to guidance; driven by very strong Q3 bookings, our beginning Q4 backlog increased by $47 million to $413 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q4 revenue of $635 million to $665 million. Our momentum is broad-based, as we expect sequential revenue growth in every one of our major end markets. Q4 gross margin, excluding special items is estimated at 61% to 63%. Q4 gross margin will benefit from improving fab utilization in Q3 and Q4. Inventory reserves and mix may also impact Q4 gross margin. Special items in Q4 gross margin are estimated at $19 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q4 operating expenses excluding special items are expected to increase approximately 2% to 3% as our variable employee bonus accrual is up, due to the higher revenue and higher gross margin. It is worth noting OpEx is expected to increase at less than half the rate of revenue growth at the midpoint of our guidance. Special items in Q4 operating expenses are estimated at $4 million to $5 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our Q4 tax rate, excluding special items is estimated at 18% to 20%. For GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.45 to $0.49. Net capital expenditures in Q4 are expected to be up from Q3 for test capacity required to support increasing demands, but still within our target of 5% to 7% of revenue. We expect share repurchases in Q4 to be consistent with the prior quarter adjusted for market conditions as appropriate. Finally, our Board of Directors has approved payment of a cash dividend of $0.26 per share, approximately a 3.2% yield at yesterday's closing stock price. I will now turn the call over to Tun\u00e7, to further discuss our business. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Thank you, Bruce, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start off with a brief overview of the analog market landscape, trends that we are observing, and why we believe Maxim is best positioned to take advantage of these trends. Over the years, Maxim has built a robust portfolio of products and capabilities, which offers us a unique industry position, to provide system level integration for our customers. Our experience in serving Mobility customers provided tremendous learning for our organization. We are now seeking the same requirements for simpler system design, lower power, higher performance and more space efficiency in our Automotive, Industrial, Communications and Datacenter markets. The convergence of these requirements is the most significant secular growth driver in the analog industry today. From Infotainment and Automotive applications to Mobile Payment systems and Industrial, customers are increasingly marching to the same drumbeat and drive for integration, as we have with our Mobility customers. In addition, Mobility is still hitting its stride, with increased content in new smartphone platforms, tablets, E-Readers, and a growing category of wearables. With that commentary as a backdrop, let me next provide some color on our major markets, starting with Consumer, as customary. We expect our June quarter Consumer end market revenue to be up strongly, reflecting a full quarter of shipments to our leading customer on their latest generation smartphone. Beyond our leading customer, we are diversifying our exposure within Mobility in several ways. First, we are expanding our technology offerings for mobile devices. Our Mobility portfolio includes power management, optical sensor, MEMS, audio amplifier and touch products. W see opportunities to differentiate in audio and are shipping next generation audio amplifiers to a major customer. Sensors are the largest growth market for us within Mobility, and we are receiving customer poll from new used cases that combine sensors with other technologies. Our high integration power system-on-a-chip remains best in class, and customized versions of this product are being designed and at multiple customers. Second, we are seeing traction in the mid-range smartphone market, particularly in China, and we achieved new power SoC wins in the quarter. We are able to leverage the systems expertise that we develop, for high end smartphones, as mid-range phones become richer in their feature set. Third, we are expanding beyond smartphones, with games and tablets, E-Readers, and wearables. A significant portion of this business is diversified beyond a leading customer. Wearable devices in particular, play to our strengths in highly integrated small form factor and low power solutions. Let me now turn to the Industrial market; I am pleased to note that our March quarter Industrial plus Automotive business was up about 25% from a year ago. We project June quarter industrial revenue to be up strongly, driven primarily by growth in Automotive and favorable seasonality in our core industrial business. We grew our Automotive business for the fifth consecutive quarter. The largest driver of this growth has been in Infotainment, as the Mobility user experience moves to the Automotive market. We are also observing that the number of processors and sensors for car, is increasing, which results in expanded opportunities for us. In the quarter, we experienced broad-based ramps at multiple customers, for infotainment and body electronics applications. Over time, we anticipate additional growth, in areas such as advanced driver assistance safety systems and in hybrid and electric vehicle battery management. Our highly integrated medical products addressed the growing need for affordable low power and biomedical monitoring devices in doctor's offices and in preventive care at home. We achieved several design wins in the quarter, including a high integration portable ultra sound transceiver, and a medical heart rate monitoring device. The key to our success is our ability to integrate low power, secure microcontrollers, with highly accurate analog measurement, and expertise in developing compact, highly efficient power management solutions. In Mobile Payments, we are sampling a new highly integrated system-on-a-chip product, which has been received well by multiple customers, making very small form factor point-of-sale terminals. We are very well positioned for the heightened security requirements for financial terminals, which utilize Chip and PIN smart card architectures. Let me now provide some commentary on our distribution business; we have seen strong end market bookings and resales in North America and Europe for the last two quarters, resulting in 15% and 20% reductions respectively in distributor days of inventory. Globally, days of inventory was 49 days at the end of the March quarter, versus 51 days at the end of the December quarter. Next, let me discuss Communications; I am pleased to note that our March quarter communications business was up over 15% from this time a year ago. In addition, we expect our Communications business to be up again in June, from an already strong March quarter. Our optical, RF and power products are all participating in the 4G LTE infrastructure buildout in China, and we saw strength in our business related to this opportunity. In addition, our cable infrastructure business continues to grow, with the adoption of our advanced data converter products. Overall, we are executing our strategy of delivering highly integrated solutions, which enable broader coverage, increased capacity and lower cost of ownership with the networks and data centers of the future. In the computing market, revenues are expected to be up in June, off a very weak March quarter. I am pleased with our progress in integrating Volterra, and we are excited about the interests our customers have shown in Volterra's high density, efficient power management solutions for the Communications, data center, enterprise server and storage markets. As Bruce mentioned, within our March quarter, we surpassed our financial synergy target for the integration of Volterra. To summarize our view for the June quarter, we expect revenue from the industrial market to strongly increase, led by Automotive applications and seasonally higher core industrial sales. We expect Consumer to be strongly up, with the ramp of new flagship smartphones and more diversified technologies. Communications is expected to be up from a strong March, driven by fiber optic infrastructure buildout and basestation deployment, and computing is expected to be up over a very weak March quarter. In closing, I would like to extend an invitation to each of you, to attend our upcoming Investor Day, which will be held in Boston on Wednesday, May 21. Registration information may be found on our web site, or by contacting our Investor Relations group. At our Investor Day, we will update our long term view of our strategy and competitive position, as well as provide live demonstrations of our latest technology. Kathy, I will now turn the call back to you. Kathy Ta : Thanks Tun\u00e7. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we would now welcome your questions. In the interest of reaching everyone in the queue, we would ask that you ask just one question with one follow-up. Jonathan, please begin polling for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from JP Morgan. Your question please. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan : Hey, thanks guys. So you gave us some very good color on the June quarter, can you just talk about your visibility in the second half of the year, and may be get into the various end markets a little bit. What you are thinking, what we should be thinking? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Well our visibility is pretty limited frankly. We have got a pretty good view of the June quarter as I shared. But when you begin to go beyond that, then in most of our markets, its kind of difficult to see what its going to look like. Having said that, if you kind of looked at our two segments, consumer and the rest of our business. The one that's more difficult obviously is Consumer, and in the other space, for us in Industrial, we are seeing channel inventory is not very high. So there is no excess that we are seeing in that, which means that most of the products we are shipping are ending up at customers. So that bodes well for the second half of the year, but as I said, its very difficult to give color, that's more specific than that. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan : Sure. And as my follow-up, I guess just to drill down on the Consumer front. So you are seeing a nice ramp at smartphone this quarter. Last year, we had a nice strong ramp of the smartphone in the same quarter, and then things tailed off a little bit in the second half of the year. Can you just maybe give us a little bit of confidence as to why that should not happen this year, or what the circumstances would be this year versus last year? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Well, there is a big difference that we see between last year and this year. Last year, if you recall our largest customer, when they launched their new [indiscernible] platform, they were very bullish and had very high expectations of end consumers' purchases of these phones. So we pretty much ramped up production and they received units for those high numbers, to find out the demand pool from the end market was not as hard. So the difference this year is that we are seeing goals that are -- and the forecast coming from the customer, that are much more moderated, and those levels that we see are more in line with what we think is going to happen, and they are more, I'd say with what we had pretty much last year, ended up happening in terms of the new phone launch. So that's why we don't really expect the big inventory build last year, that eventually resulted in our revenues falling. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan : Great. Thanks a lot. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Your question please. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities : Good afternoon. Thanks so much for letting me ask the question. On Industrial, it looks like your performance is quite a bit better than the supply chain, seeing that Avnet this morning was light on revenues, and then just looking at some of your mixed signal peers like Linear and Xilinx, the Industrial performance is nowhere near as good as what you're showing here in the March quarter. You're guiding for growth again in June. So I was hoping you could just may be provide additional color on why your Industrial and Auto business is performing so much better than the rest of the supply chain. And I guess as a follow-up, is there any concern that, as you go into the second half of the year, that we may see some numerous versions? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Okay. So, as you know, and you noted Romit, we do combine Automotive inside of Industrial, and if I were to kind of break what the reasons are, that we are doing pretty well in the market, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Primarily, our Automotive business has been very strong. That obviously is contributing to growth in Industrial. And the reason for that, mainly is because, we have got a product portfolio in some cases that's more diversified than some of our competitors, and there is a strong pool for those products. So we are seeing good growth in Automotive, so that's contributing to that. And in Industrial, if you recall, we've got a product strategy that's got a high integration of component that's more vertical as more core or building block type products, and we are really seeing good growth in both of those year-over-year and I think that that's really helping us with this growth. We were a little bit concerned, whether this was just inventory build at our distributors of the channel. So the data [ph] of inventory says that that's not the case, actually we chose that, especially in distribution in Europe and the U.S., that's gone down significantly, as I said in my commentary, so that's not happening. And we also have looked at some of the bellwether Industrial companies to see whether their revenues are increasing or their forecasting increases, and three or four companies that we looked at, they all are saying they are seeing strong growth in their businesses. So all of that is indicating that there is more activity there. Whether I can answer the question on why we are different than others, that's pretty difficult. On some of them, we have been on different cycles frankly in the past. So just looking at one quarter, its pretty hard to say, but we can kind of tell you about how are doing, its kind of hard for us to tell why that's different from what others are saying. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities : Yeah, its just that 25% year-on-year growth really stands out for this kind of end market. Just lastly, Tun\u00e7 or Bruce, could you tell us what Automotive is now as a percentage of your business? Bruce Kiddoo : So Romit, as you know, we don't break that out, something we are thinking about. But right now, as we have said before, its in the high single digits, and as Tun\u00e7 indicated, it continues to grow very strongly, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. I think as Tun\u00e7 indicated, right, it is five consecutive quarters of growth, and so this is one of those markets that, as we get those design wins, that have seasonal strength in the first half of the calendar year. But then those just sort of layer on top and the old ones aren't falling off. So we can -- we see real strong growth in the first half of the year, and more modest growth in the back half of the year. But overall, that has been a very steady and a very strong grower for us. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities : All right. Great quarter. Thank you. Kathy Ta : Thanks Romit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question please. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital : Hey, good afternoon guys. Couple of questions; first, on computing, obviously down much more than the market. Was that just the paring back of products and how did that fare versus your expectations in the quarter? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So on the computing side, as I said in my prepared remarks, it was down strongly in the March quarter, and the biggest reason for that was weakness in the two largest OEMs that we saw, and the server market in general, if you followed their announcements, you could see major double digit declines in their businesses. So there is the effect of that for sure on our business, and its -- in this quarter, there is some recovery of that business, but essentially it has been down, because the U.S. OEMs have been weak, in terms of their end market sales. One more thing, we also include notebook in computing, and that also seasonally goes down, plus its an area that both us and before us, Volterra had stopped investing in, so that was expected, going into the future. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital : Got you. Thanks. And then on the financial terminals, there is obviously a lot of talk about infrastructure rollout ahead of the U.S. rollout next year. How big is that financial terminal business, if you can break out any rough terms and are you -- where do you see the kind of [indiscernible] infrastructure obviously has to be in place before they roll out any card? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So financial terminals percent of revenue is really not that large for us, its in the low single digits. However our technology is very suitable and the dollar content is higher in Chip and PIN type terminals, which as you know is not what's used in the U.S., and there is lot of discussions about when that should get rolled out, because of the several [indiscernible], at the end of last year. But, when that does start to roll out and we don't have the timing yet, frankly, we will be well positioned for it, because our products are very well suited because of our small form factor, as well as our fully certified solutions in terms of security. Our success, we have had in other parts of the world and Europe and China can definitely be translated into the U.S., and that would add to our revenues in the coming years. The exact timing, we can't tell at the moment. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital : Thank you, Tun\u00e7. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs : Great guys. Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Just referring back to one of the previous questions, I mean, someone was trying to suggest that you guys are going to have a problem in Industrial and Automotive, because you're growing quickly in the June quarter. Aren't I correct, that you had the fastest growth of any Industrial Automotive analog company in the June quarter of last year, and you didn't have a big decline in that particular segment last year? Bruce Kiddoo : I don't know if we were the biggest. We certainly had kind of high double digit, high teens growth last year, and we were able to maintain that level. And again, I think for a couple of reasons, one, the Automotive, kind of -- is strong in the first half of the year, but then it sort of maintains that level in the back half of the year. And then the other thing again, I think as Tun\u00e7 indicated, inventory levels are very low, right. We are below 50 right now. We are at 49 days; and if you look at Europe and North America, they are also very low. And I guess the final item I would highlight is, when we look at end market bookings, which is sort of the -- are most -- kind of the bookings of the small customers on the distributors. In the Industrial regions, U.S., Europe, Korea, those were all up -- those end market bookings were all up very strongly in the quarter, and so again, that's another leading indicator that we see this kind of continued strength, at least for -- certainly this quarter, and it seems for -- its set up for next quarter as well. James Covello - Goldman Sachs : Thoughtful, thank you. For a follow-up, obviously the market is always going to be concerned about percentage of revenue at any one big customer. Can you just give us, on a qualitative basis, relative to how big your biggest customer might have gotten in prior product cycle ramps. Can you give us any kind of, again, qualitative or a feel for how big it might get in the June quarter as a percentage of total revenue, compared to what it looked like last time? is it close to being the same, is it quite a bit different because of diversification from other segment, somewhere in between? Bruce Kiddoo : I think its significantly different. As Tun\u00e7 indicated last year, in our fiscal third quarter of 2013, our largest customer was very bullish on both their new product ramp and on their existing platform. And certainly that customer spiked in that quarter, I think we publicly said, it went up to over 30%, and therefore for the year. Samsung, we reported in our 10-K, it was around 27% of revenues. I think we have consistently indicated that, today, Samsung is around 20% of revenues. And so that's sort of the relative way [ph] for that. James Covello - Goldman Sachs : Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Steven Smigie - Raymond James : Great. Thanks a lot. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the diversification you're seeing in the Consumer business. I guess one part of that is, can you talk about for the SoC wins that you mentioned for the Chinese smartphones. Would that be revenue that's ramping at this point, or is that just you have the design wins and that's future revenue, will be one part; and the other part would just be, are there other major platforms out there that you've gained on, that you might ramp on later in the year? Thanks. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : What I mentioned in my prepared remarks about design wins for our power SoCs, these are wins that are occurring as we speak, so they don't really contribute to revenue until the second half of the year. So that's kind of the color on that one; and your other question was about others, diversification efforts. We have communicated that in the past, but let me repeat what we are doing. We are first of all, trying to diversify technologies beyond power, and I spoke of that a little bit, by winning in optical sensors and motion sensors and MEMS and as well as touch controllers and audio. We are getting design wins in all of these. They are not at levels that are other than the optical sensors at levels that are as high as our power products yet, but we are definitely going in the right direction. We also, in the last year, won a lot of designs in product platforms different from high-end smartphones, so we have won designs now in mid-range phones, we have won designs in tablets and e-readers, and there is this new area of wearables that are coming, so that was our second piece of our diversification strategy. And the third piece, if you recall was to achieve design wins with multiple customers, other than our largest, and in that space, we are making progress as well. You've seen some [indiscernible] that are showing products at our other large Mobility customers, and as I said, I mentioned some of the Chinese wins that we also talked about. So the diversification strategy is doing well on all three fronts. Steven Smigie - Raymond James : Great. Thank you. Then, on the Automotive businesses, could you talk a little bit about the dollar content, or at least the diversity of products that you have in an electric vehicle and hybrid battery management solution and similarly on infotainment application? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Well we have, if you look at that key areas that we invested in, and we believe there is going to be long term growth are infotainment applications. And in infotainment, we make regulators of power. We also make tuner ICs for satellites or digital audio broadcast type applications, related to infotainment, but also for safety applications, we have got products that we make for distribution of video content, and this is really to get video from multiple video cameras that are now placed, especially in our high end markets. But it will all migrate to mid-range cars as well. We have great technology in that space to robustly get the information from point A to point B. We have got products for Keyless Go, this is a very robust solution to make sure that we have the secure solution that's lower cost for our customer, but also provides a longer range for keys that are used in Keyless Go.  Finally, you asked about hybrid and electric vehicles, we have battery charging and monitoring ICs that go into both -- any car that's got a significant amount of battery in it, whether its hybrid or all electric. And also remember that, these electric cars also use all of these other solutions as well, infotainment, video content distribution, Keyless Go etcetera. One area in Automotive that's providing our success is that we do have a pretty broad range of products for broad applications, which means basically that, since we got into this after many of our competitors, we've got a small share in each one of these, that's why there is potential for us to grow, as we are demonstrating, because we are really starting off of a small base from each and every one of these applications or solutions for our customers. Steven Smigie - Raymond James : Great. Thank you. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from ISI Group. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys. This is [indiscernible] calling in for CJ, question about your sensors. In terms of proliferating them to customers other than your main customers, is the Android ecosystem incorporating some of these capabilities? Do the manufacturers have to kind of layer it in on their own? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Well, can I get some clarification, when you say sensors, are you talking about optical or are you talking about MEMS? Unidentified Analyst : Both. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Both, okay. So most of our success so far, just for clarity purposes, has been on the optical side. And on the optical side, it really depends. Some products are going to modules, but then get manufactured by a module maker, and then ends up at the smartphone maker. In some cases, they are installed directly on to the motherboard. So it really depends. But in each case, we really have to provide a good amount of support, application support, to make sure that our products do work in tip top form, and they provide the accuracy and the robustness that our customer requires. So having that ability in handling a customer also helps us in terms of the stickiness of the [indiscernible] eventually when somebody else wants to break in. On the MEMS side, we really -- our success in MEMS so far has been on the Automotive side, in terms of winning projects. As you recall, we reported last year, that we had brought the MEMS technology, brought it up successfully in our own manufacturing facilities, which was a great achievement. We did design our first generation Six Degree of Freedom consumer MEMS product, they fell short on power consumption, although it provided much better accuracy than any of our competitors were able to. So we have now worked on generating our second design, which addresses the power problem, but still provides a great deal of accuracy. So now when we are working directly with the phone makers in order to achieve design wins. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao from Bank of America. Aashish Rao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. First one for Tun\u00e7, may be I will just follow-up on the sensor question. You've had good revenue growth over the last couple of years, with gesture sensors, heart rate monitors and others. But it looks like several competitors are also coming into the market, soon after you -- and are also competing fairly aggressively on the pricing front. So just wondering, I mean, could you provide some perspective on what's the IP that you have in the sensor business? How protected are you from others doing the same, three, six months down the road, or is this going to be dependent on continually finding the next big sensor thing every year? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Well on the optical sensor front, there is obviously heavy competition. These sockets are pretty valuable, just like they are valuable to us, they are valuable to their competitors. So they will go after them. There is -- these products are really not that easy to make frankly. There is -- you not only have to have the process technology to be able to make them, there is a lot of additions for the optical side, and there is also algorithms that one has to really figure out and make them robust, so they work in environments that are quite interesting frankly. So they are barriers to entry in terms of both design, process technology or manufacturing, as well as algorithms. Now having said that, obviously the competitors do put a lot of resources to overcome those. So your assessment is pretty accurate. We have to be coming up with new innovations in this area going forward. But that's the requirement that we hear from our customers. So its not like, this is a stable business, a known solution and generation after generation, all they are asking for, is cost reductions. That's not the environment that we are in right now. The environment is, from our customers and from us frankly, some of these ideas were ours, and we propose them to our customers. We are seeing new needs for sensors to do all kinds of health, fitness, environmental type measurements. So, when I have these discussions with the engineers here, they just have a long list of things that we need to make, and that always is good, because it means you can innovate and you always have a way of staying ahead of your competitors. Aashish Rao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Cool. Thanks for that color. Then maybe one more for Bruce, a question more on longer term trends in gross margins. Your June quarter sales guidance is probably going to set a new high. Yet you are operating at the lower half of your target gross margin range of 61% to 64%, and prior years, even at lower sales, you are above 63%, and I was thinking, maybe its mobile and computing, but that's actually a decline as a percent on mix for the last couple of years, so it should also be helping you provide an uplift. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes, is it mix, pricing, foundry, outsourcing or other factors that are pressuring gross margins? Bruce Kiddoo : I think as we have discussed previously, the biggest factor affecting our gross margin today, is really utilization. We had our -- our utilization dipped back in the December quarter, it went from 71% to 62% utilization, the fab utilization. And as you know, [indiscernible] had an impact, both in the December quarter, and it carried over into the March quarter as well. In March, it was up a little bit, it got 64% utilization, but when we now look into the June quarter, we are actually seeing its going to be probably be up into the low to mid 70s. And so we are seeing that pick up in utilization. Again, because of kind of the way, you have to kind of count that as the product turns, we don't get the full benefit of that in this quarter. But certainly, to the extent our business continues to grow, and we are able to kind of efficiently load our factories, utilization will go up and that, by itself, should be a tailwind for gross margins. Other things that we always have to deal with of course is, like you've indicated, there is always some level of mix. Inventory reserves in consumer business, where you have kind of large kind of product ramps and declines, has been a challenge over probably the last year. But its really -- utilization is the key driver for that. Its something we are very focused on. We are starting to see those come back up, and that's a positive sign for us. Aashish Rao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is [indiscernible] calling for Craig. Thanks for taking my question. So going back to computing, like computing had been weak for the last few quarters, just kind of coming up next quarter, due to, like, weakness from the major U.S. OEMs. Could you just comment on any kind of attraction you are seeing with the mega scale data center guys? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So, when you say datacenter, you're talking about the enterprise customers, or are you asking about cloud? Unidentified Analyst : I am talking about cloud. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Okay. So if you look at most of our current business in the computing market, a lot of it actually is coming from the Volterra acquisition, and much of the business that Volterra had before the acquisition was, more in the enterprise data center market, selling to the two or three large OEMs that you are very familiar with. So that's the reason for the weakness that we've seen. Now going forward, we've really taken that technology and have shown it to the cloud customers, and we are seeing a lot of interest from there, because we are providing great efficiency. We are providing the ability to really lower the total cost of ownership throughout the life of the cloud center or a data center, and we see a lot of interest from them. However, it does take a while for these designs to ramp, and what we have brought into the picture, compared to what Volterra was doing last year, is that we have a sales force that's a lot more effective, because we have more of them. And we also have the name and the cloud of Maxim is a large company, so they can really depend on us and rely on us. So that all is going to resolve us, in us getting more wins in cloud, either servers or cloud storage. But those revenues are not going to show up for a while, so that's pretty much no effect on the current quarter or probably even the current year. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, that's helpful. Going back to the Consumer business, you're prepared to modestly touch upon the traction you're seeing in the mid-end smartphone segment, especially in China. Could you just compare [ph] the dollar content you are seeing there, versus the high end and the overall competitive environment in that space? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : In that space, let me just kind of describe what we are doing, so that its easier to explain the rest of the story. So essentially what we are doing is, we have several power SoC products that we have developed for high end phones, and what we do is, offer the many, a portfolio of functions that a product like that has, and see how well that fits into mid-range, or even a higher-range phone in the China customers. And in many cases, it fits as it is, but in some cases, it doesn't, which means that we have to change the content of the product. And as soon as you start changing the content of the product, obviously if its lower, which is typically the way it goes, because there are fewer functions in a mid-range phone, the selling prices of product also falls. So it is -- but those are still good opportunities for us, especially because we don't have to spend a lot of R&D to design them, we have already basically spent the money to get all the functions, and it does make sense for us to win these. So the total dollar content for a power SoC, I'd safely say that, what you get out of a mid-range phone, because your functionality is less than what you get in a fully functional power SoC that we would sell to a large high-end phone. But being able to give you exact numbers, obviously we don't want to do it for competitive reasons. But it also depends on each customer, because they are asking for different types of products. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. Congrats once again on a good quarter. Thank you. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Susquehanna Financial. Your question please. Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group : Thank you. I have a question on the Consumer business, and given your comments on the more moderate goals this year, particularly in the June quarter, should that imply the seasonal peak for that business should be in the September quarter as it typically is? Obviously, I understand that depends upon sell-through of the phones, but just trying to understand what the expectations are at the moment? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So it is, as you know, this market was very hard to predict last year, and this year is really no different. So trying to predict, how many of these are going to be bought by consumers, this quarter and next is very difficult for us to do, and we only have one datapoint to rely on, which is what our customer tells us, that so far, we haven't seen any indication of a change in the forecast that they have provided us. So its very hard to say when the peak is going to occur for these cell phone platforms, from a revenue standpoint for Maxim. Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group : Okay, that's fair. With respect to lead times, could you give us some visibility as to where the customer requested lead times are, and where your lead times are standing right now, and I guess, as conditions improve, are you seeing any increase in lead times, which may encourage customers to take on some additional inventory in the future? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : I think this is the first quarter we took that out of [indiscernible]. Bruce, why don't you? Bruce Kiddoo : Well sure, and the reason we took it out, is that it has been amazingly flat for about the past year. I mean, if we look at what customers are requesting, its right about nine, nine and a half weeks, it has been right in that range. It only really moves when our mix of business changes. But if we look at sort of the lead time by each one of our, kind of major customer sets at our end markets, it has been very consistent about nine, nine and a half weeks. What we have meant to the customer, is still also pretty consistent around six weeks. We do see, where we were seeing very strong demand. You do see some of our customers, just giving us a little bit more visibility, just to be helpful, until an area is on the Industrial side or Automotive, we see some expenses of lead times there, but again, we think that's really more of just wanting to give us that visibility, and its really in very kind of select markets. Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets : Hi thank you. Tun\u00e7, you guys have done a good job in diversifying your product mix away from traditionally what used to be power SoC S processor, and now going on to, for the full phone and also on the sensor. Is there a way for us to think about the Consumer, as we think through the year, and I understand it depends on the ramps, but what will the consumer mix look like in terms of the product diversification that you guys have been working on? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Yeah okay. Let me make sure I understand the question, you're really asking about, within the consumer business, what percentage comes from Power, what comes from sensors and so on, did I get that right? Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets : Yeah. And I get some of these things just ramping, but I am thinking more, as we exit the year, versus what used to be traditionally, which used to be mostly power management? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : I would say that, the majority is still power management. I think that we have added a significant amount of optical sensor revenue in there. But we have been kind of in that order, and then we have got audio products that are coming in, in there. And there is also a slew of building block products, that we don't need to talk about that much, but they are all there, protection chips and authentication ICs and so on. But I really don't know how its going to look like by the end of the year, because of kind of the order of the size. So tower, optical sensing, then probably audio and then other functions add to that [ph]. Bruce Kiddoo : Just in addition, Tun\u00e7 talked about sort of the three ways for taking a diversification in your question, and then Tun\u00e7 has responded around technology and function. Obviously we are [indiscernible] to diversify across platform. We have talked about sort of the mid-range phones, tablets. There is emerging market around wearables, and then finally, that diversification around customers, and again, we have talked some about China. I think overall, we feel good about how we are positioned to continue to further that diversification across the major OEMs. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets : Great. And I am a big believer of your strategy Bruce, but I just wanted to get to some, is there any way to quantify, for instance, on the customer front, you guys have been talking about China becoming a bigger mix, and the evidence is there in the teardowns and what have you. But if there is any way you could quantify, it would be very helpful. Thank you very much. Bruce Kiddoo : Thank you. Kathy Ta : Operator, we will take the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question please. Evan Wang - Stifel Nicolaus : Hi. This is Evan Wang calling in for Tore. I was wondering, this is just being the second quarter that you mentioned about wearables. I was wondering if you can give a sense of, what this application or this market means to you. Are you ramping at this time, are you in production, how many customers are you delivering the products to in the wearable area, and are these customers the same customers, such as smartphone customers, or do you have to penetrate new customers for this? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So let me give some color on that one. Obviously, we do have wins at our largest customer, on some of the wearable products that they have, and actually began to sell. But to us, wearable market means, that its any kind of attachment, wireless attachment to a smartphone or an independent unit that we actually carry around, either on your wrist or by attachment somewhere on your body. So we actually see different applications for wearables, some of them are really in the Consumer space, I'd say more of fitness and health and tracking of some of the body parameters, as well as providing a way to connect, more recently to your phone. So that space is really serviced by the traditional names and is going to come from companies that are already in the Mobility market. But wearables to us also means wearable type products that are used in, I would say, more medical type applications, and that's the one, I also mentioned about units that might be used for monitoring health, to try to diagnose issues, and trying to do that outside of the hospital. So we have design wins that we are going after on both sides, both on the consumer front and on, what I'd call, more of the medical front. So the customer base that we are working with, trying to win designs are on those fronts. So there is some of our traditional Mobility customers, and some of them are actually not, they are more on the medical side of the business. It is not a very well defined market yet. Everybody is going to try to find their way, and what I can tell you is that, we are working with all the big names. So I am trying to get design wins for, in some cases, specialized products for the market, and in some cases, are standard products that we can sell as well. Evan Wang - Stifel Nicolaus : When do you expect revenue for this category to become significant? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Yeah that was the other part of your question. We do have revenue today, but its very small compared to the rest of the business, actually, do we break that out Bruce? Bruce Kiddoo : We don't break it out. We include it within our consumer business. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : Yeah, it's included. But I am kind of looking at the numbers that Bruce showed me here. Its kind of in single percent digit type of numbers, so its on the low end. Its very nascent right now. But we believe, and I believe that it is going to be a growth market. We will participate in it, namely because -- if you think about any kind of wearable device that you have, its constrained on size, because nobody wants to wear something that's bulky, which means that its constrained on the battery size, as well on the electronic sized. So it plays very well into our high integration strategy. Kathy Ta : Thanks Evan Evan Wang - Stifel Nicolaus : Very good. I have a follow-up question. In the past, you have given some metrics on what percentage of your products are highly integrated products, devices, versus more traditional types of devices or ICs. Can you talk a little bit about the trend that you've seen lately? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So the trend that we have seen lately -- I mean, the long range trend, we have spoken about a lot. I mean, back in 2007, it was in the single -- in the teens, in the mid-teens, and today its in the high-40s as a percentage. In the last two or three quarters, it has been hovering the high 40s, so it hasn't really kept going up, and that had something to do with the other parts of the business growing faster maybe, compared to Mobility. Mobility is still two-thirds of our high integration revenue, and the other one-third is in these other markets, Industrial, Medical, Automotive, and Communication type markets. But what we are seeing is, the same trend as I said in my prepared remarks, if customers are really asking for solutions, they make their jobs easier, number one. To make sure that they can take their system and make it either smaller or higher performance or consume less power. Everybody talks about consuming less power, and the best way to do that, is with higher integration solution. So even though today, its two-thirds mobility, one-third in all the others, I firmly believe that that percentage, we are going to see the other one-third growing, in high integration going into the future. But that's kind of the summary. High 40s, two-thirds is mobility, one-third is other markets. Evan Wang - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you very much. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : You're welcome. Kathy Ta : Thank you. Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital. Earl Hege - RBC Capital Markets : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Its Earl Hege calling in for Doug. Just quickly on ASP trends, what are you guys seeing both for the overall company and perhaps within each segment, so you know, what kind of ASP content growth opportunity do you guys have going forward there? Thank you. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So I assume you're asking about ASPs for the whole company, not in a particular sector. And you know, if you look at our ASPs, its really hard for me to even measure that, in terms of that telling us something about our business. We have ASPs that range from down in the $0.10 range, all the way up to $40, $50. So when there is such a wide variation, it doesn't quite make sense to us to measure what the median is. Now having said that, we haven't read reports probably like you have about ASP declines in analog, and we are very cognizant of that. What we can say is that, because of our high enriched strategy, we have been able to make sure that we got differentiated products that we are selling to our customers, and they are not really provide by a lot of suppliers, which is when usually ASPs fall, and for that reason, we have been able to maintain the gross margin in the window that we targeted for ourselves. So in general, we don't really look at that as some indication, because there is so much variation in the ASP profile of the company. Our focus really is on making sure that we make winning products for the customer. If we do that, we know that we can get paid for all the hard work we do in R&D. Earl Hege - RBC Capital Markets : Great. Thank you; and just a quick follow-up, one of your analog competitors commented that the largest growth markets of AC are going to be Industrial and Auto, as it appears. Do you guys have visibility right now on what that kind of looks like to you? Tun\u00e7 Doluca : You said, one of our competitors said the largest growth opportunity was in Industrial and Automotive? Earl Hege - RBC Capital Markets : Right. Tun\u00e7 Doluca : So we -- I mean, where is the largest growth opportunity? It really depends on, which segments of those markets that you pick. But we do, if you look at industry experts, the growth rate for analog, according to marketing companies are in the 4% to 5% range projected for the next few years overall. But if you look at the growth rate projected for industrial, and for the segment of Automotive that we are really investing in, they are pretty much double that rate. So I would say that, that's a pretty high growth rate. The highest growth rate that's projected in all the analog market, still continues to be in mobility, and that's a much higher number than these numbers. So as long as we go and find, the markets, there are subsegments that are growing. I think we will do well as a company, and in industrial and automotive, that's what we have been able to do, and that's why we really demonstrated very large growth rates year-over-year in the March quarter. Kathy Ta : Thanks Doug. So Jonathan, I think that was our last question? Operator : Certainly. I now hand the program back to you. Kathy Ta : Okay. So this concludes Maxim Integrated's conference call. We would like to thank you for your participation and for your interest in Maxim. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Kathy Ta, Managing Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kathy. Kathryn Ta : Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome, everyone, to Maxim Integrated's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Tunc Doluca; and Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Kiddoo. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, I'd like to remind you that these statements must be considered in conjunction with the cautionary warnings that appear in our SEC filings. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this call involve risks and uncertainty and that future events may differ materially from the statements made. For additional information, please refer to the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, which are posted on our website or available from the company without charge. Now I'll turn the call over to Bruce. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Thanks, Kathy. I will review Maxim's fourth quarter financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $642 million, up 6% from the third quarter. Our revenue mix by major market in Q4 was approximately 35% from consumer; 27%, industrial; 23%, communications and data center; 10%, automotive; and 5%, computing. In the quarter, our consumer business was roughly flat, below our expectations, due to recent weakness in smartphones and tablets, primarily at our largest customer. Our industrial business was up strongly, better than expected, driven by growth in our core industrial end market. Our communication and data center business was up with continued strength due to the China 4G LTE rollout, and improved demand from several OEMs off a weak March quarter. Our automotive business was up strongly, as expected, with new design win ramps across multiple applications and customers. Finally, our computing business was up, driven by a rebound in our notebook, desktop and peripherals businesses. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 60.4%, below expectations, but up from 60.1% in the prior quarter. Gross margin benefited from higher fab utilization, which was offset by higher inventory reserves. Reserves taken in the quarter were primarily to address older generation smartphone and tablet products. We are implementing additional controls to manage excess inventory while continuing to ensure high levels of delivery performance. Special items in Q4 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisitions. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $227 million, up from $222 million in the prior quarter. Operating expenses increased at less than half the rate of revenue growth in Q4, in line with our model, as we continue to tightly control spending. Special items in Q4 operating expenses included acquisition-related and restructuring charges. Q4 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $161 million, or 25% of revenue, an increase from 23% in the March quarter. The Q4 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 19.9%, up from 18.3% in the prior quarter. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.43, below our guided range, primarily due to lower revenues and inventory reserves. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $234 million, or 36% of revenue. Inventory was 103 days, excluding special items, down 6 days from the prior quarter. Inventory in the channel increased as expected from 49 to 54 days, returning to prior levels. Net capital additions totaled $25 million in Q4, flat from the prior quarter, and at 4% of revenue, within our new long-term target range of 3% to 5% of revenue. Free cash flow was $649 million for fiscal year 2014, or 26% of revenue. Share repurchases totaled $41 million in Q4, as we bought back 1.2 million shares. We also paid $74 million in dividends to our shareholders. In fiscal 2014, we returned over 90% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $141 million in the third quarter to $1.37 billion. Moving on to guidance, our beginning Q1 backlog decreased by $36 million, or 9%, to $377 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q1 revenue of $580 million to $620 million, which reflects a cautious view of smartphone and tablet shipments at our largest customer, as well as shipments into other Mobility opportunities being later than we had expected. Outside of consumer, we expect industrial to be seasonally down, communications and data center flat and automotive up in Q1. Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 59% to 62%, flat with the prior quarter. We are forecasting flat inventory reserve charges due to recent demand weakness in older products. Special items in Q1 gross margin are estimated at approximately $19 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q1 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to decline approximately 1% to 2%, including 1 month of our annual merit increase. We continue to control spending. Special items in Q1 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $4 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our Q1 tax rate, excluding special items, is estimated at 18% to 20%. For Q1 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.34 to $0.40. Net capital expenditures in Q1 are expected to be down slightly from Q4 and within our new target of 3% to 5% of revenue. We expect share repurchases in Q4 to be consistent with the prior quarter, adjusted from market conditions as appropriate. Finally, based on confidence in our long-term financial model, including lower capital spending requirements, our Board of Directors has approved an 8% increase in our cash dividend to $0.28 per share, approximately a 3.4% yield at yesterday's closing stock price. In summary, we believe our long-term financial strategy of growth, leverage and return is on track. Mobility is well positioned to grow through new technologies, new platforms and a broader customer revenue base. Our other businesses grew strongly in the June quarter compared to last year, with automotive growing over 50% year-over-year. We expect gross margin to improve as we enhance inventory controls and fill our internal factories. We remain committed to our 30% operating margin target, which will benefit from expected revenue growth, gross margin leverage and tight OpEx controls. And finally, we are focused on returning cash to shareholders, as demonstrated by today's announced 8% increase in our dividend. I will now turn the call over to Tunc to further discuss our business. Tunc Doluca : Thank you, Bruce, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to open my commenting on trends we are seeing with our Mobility customers, as well as the broader analog market and Maxim business implications of these trends. In Mobility, consumers are adopting the latest generation products at a brisk rate, while the previous generations of products ramp down rapidly. Forecasting this transition was challenging. In the June quarter, the rapid decline of the older generation tablets and smartphones at our largest customer affected our business in 2 ways : first, we saw lower-than-expected revenue from older generation Mobility products, with particular weakness in tablet revenue. The replacement cycle for tablets is proving to be longer than for smartphones. And second, our margins were impacted, due to the need to take an inventory charge for these older generation products. Now aside from the softness in Mobility products, the June quarter reflected an -- the overall strength of Maxim's product portfolio. We grew revenue in every one of our major markets outside of consumer, and we achieved record revenue. The strong performance of our portfolio is consistent with our system integration strategy. Our customers in automotive, industrial, communications and data center markets are looking for simpler designs, lower power, higher performance and more space efficiency in their products. In addition, as we enter the second half of the calendar year, we see that the consumer market also requires an increasing system level innovation. We see new content opportunities in new smartphone platforms, tablets and a growing category of wearables. With that commentary as a backdrop, let me next provide some color on our major markets. I will start with consumer. We expect our September quarter consumer end market revenue to be down significantly, with weakness at our leading customer, including their latest flagship smartphone. This guidance is clearly lower than what our expectations were up to only a few short weeks ago and reflects a cautious and prudent view. This weakness is partially offset by the ramp of a new smartphone at our leading customer, where we expect to have increased content over the prior generation. At our other large Mobility customer, our design wins continue. Here we expect revenue contributions by the end of the calendar year from existing platforms and a new category of consumer products. We've continued to diversify our product exposure within Mobility in 3 ways : first, we are expanding our technology offerings for mobile devices. Our Mobility portfolio includes power management, optical sensor, MEMS, audio amplifier and touch products. Our newest audio amplifiers combine superior sound quality with a space-saving design that extends battery life and is winning designs in tablets. In addition, sensors are the largest growth market for us within Mobility, and we are receiving customer pull for new use cases that combine sensors with other technologies. Second, we are diversifying our customer base beyond our largest customer, with Chinese manufacturers and in other leading OEMs. At leading Chinese customers, we're winning with our highly integrated power management solutions. The proportion of total Maxim revenue from our leading customer has dropped to about 20% for fiscal year 2014, and we expect this percentage to decline to the mid-teens in the September quarter. Third, we are helping to create new categories of portable and wearable devices. Wearable devices in particular play to our strengths in highly integrated, small form factor and low-power solutions. Let me next turn to the industrial market. I'm pleased to note that we grew our June quarter industrial business over 10% year-over-year, with strong growth in our core business and support from our vertical industrial markets. In core industrial, we are enabling distributed control on the factory floor through compact, efficient designs that produce less heat in the manufacturing environment. We project September quarter industrial revenue to be down from a strong June quarter. This is driven by typical seasonality in our core business and partially offset by continued momentum in our vertical businesses. In mobile payments, we are sampling a new highly integrated system-on-a-chip product, which has been well received by several customers. We're well positioned, as more stringent security standards for financial terminals get deployed in the U.S. Let me now provide some commentary on our distribution business. We saw strong end market resales across all geographic regions. Globally, days of inventory returned to prior levels at 54 days in the June quarter, versus only 49 days at the end of the March quarter. We grew our automotive business for the sixth consecutive quarter. We grew June quarter revenue over 50% year-over-year. We expect this business to be up modestly in September. The largest driver of this growth has been in Infotainment from a broad set of customers as the Mobility user experience moves to the automotive market. Next, let me discuss communications and data center. I'm pleased to note that our June quarter comms and data center revenue was up sequentially, and was up 30% year-over-year. There are 3 primary drivers of our year-over- year growth : one, we are benefiting from acquisition and organic growth in server applications, driven by Volterra technology; two, we are participating in the 4G LTE infrastructure build-out in China with our optical, RF and power products; and three, our cable infrastructure business continues to grow with the adoption of our advanced data converter products. We expect our comm and data center business to be flat in September from a strong June quarter. Overall, we are executing our strategy of delivering highly integrated solutions, which enable broader coverage, increased capacity and lower cost of ownership for the networks and data centers of the future. In the computing market, revenues in June were up strongly, driven by short-term strength in the notebook business. We expect computing to be down slightly in September. To summarize our view for the September quarter, we expect revenue from the industrial market to be down with seasonally lower core industrial sales. We expect automotive to be up slightly for a seventh consecutive quarter as we deliver on our pipeline of design wins. We are taking a cautious and prudent view of our consumer segment. We forecast consumer to be down significantly, driven by softness in smartphones at our leading customer, partially offset by the ramp of new flagship Mobility products. Communications and data center is expected to be flat from a strong June, with continued support from the fiber optic infrastructure build-out and base station deployment. Finally, computing is expected to be flat after a recovery in June. In closing, while we experience significant softness in our consumer market, we are on track to the long-term strategy we articulated at our recent Investor Day. Almost half of Maxim's revenue comes from highly integrated analog products. We are bringing the tremendous learning that we have gained as an organization to new power-efficient applications in industrial, automotive, comms and data center. And we are executing on our strategy to diversify our customer base in Mobility. Kathy, I'll now turn the call back to you. Kathryn Ta : Thanks, Tunc. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we would now welcome your questions. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan, please begin polling for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : You referenced weakness in both tablet and smartphones. Am I right in reading it that the tablet weakness was more about the June quarter miss and the phone weakness is more about the September quarter weakness, is that right? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Absolutely. I think in June, it was probably both tablets and older smartphones. And I think when we're talking about September, it is actually across all of the products. But certainly, the sort of the, kind of the leading-edge smartphone is the largest contributor. James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then, I mean, it feels a little bit like Groundhog Day with last year. Hopefully, it won't be as deep and last as long, because it seems like you guys are taking actions pretty quickly. And I understood the comments about -- it was 33%, now it's 20%, 20%. It's going to be down to mid-teens. I mean, at what point do you guys consider it not worth it re-ramping with this business? I mean, we're going to go down the path again of next year, new phone cycle lunch and leaving ourselves exposed to this kind of dynamic again. I mean, is there any thought within the organization from a strategic perspective to stop pursuing this kind of business? Tunc Doluca : So I mean, if we look at it, your numbers are right. I mean, we had a -- if you look at last year, we had a pretty deep revenue drop from our largest customer. As you pointed out, it is less this year than it was last year. Well, we have to accept the fact that this business is cyclical. There will be new platforms or new products at our customers that get announced and they're going to have -- we have ups and downs, whether it were our largest customer, or other customers that are in the Mobility market. But we are committed to this market. We can see that it's profitable for us. The customers really need the types of products that we make. We're able to win these sockets, not only at one customer, but at multiple customers. And all of that leads us to believe that this is a good market for us to be in with huge growth potential. So what we need to get used to is the fact that there are ups and downs and to make the adjustments necessary so that we don't get into inventory situations, of which we got into a little bit last quarter. So other than that, this is a good market, whether we're in the power side, on the sensor side, on the audio side or on the MEMS side. So we're going to pursue it, just like we said at our Investor Day. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I apologize if you addressed this in your prepared comments, I've been jumping across 3 or 4 different calls. But can you help me quantify your handset exposure today between flagship, mid-range, low-end? And then, kind of help me understand for the shortfall in the September quarter, how each of those buckets kind of contributed. And I guess -- that was my first question and then I have a follow-up, sorry. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. This is Bruce. I'll take that. Well, certainly, the bulk of our business is still in the high-end, and I think we've said, probably 10% to 20% of our business is in the kind of the mid-range category, from a smartphone point of view. But still, we're primarily in the high-end. And when we look at the kind of where we saw that -- the shortfall, it clearly was in, as we've said, in the June quarter. It was due to the older products, both the kind of the older smartphones and the tablets. We still see some weakness from those in the September quarter. But this is really the kind of the demand for their flagship product, it's certainly weaker than expected. And I think it's worth pointing out that this is something which has kind of weakened as just in the kind of the last couple of weeks as well. So it is an area that we've looked at. As Tunc said, it's something I think we'll get better at managing the inventory side on. And as we continue to kind of sell different technologies into different platforms, have different customers, we look to -- try to smooth out these ups and downs. But I absolutely agree with Tunc's question, there's going to be product life cycle fluctuations in this business going forward. Going forward, my final point is, just again to reiterate what Tunc said, this is a profitable business for us. This isn't a question where maybe some of our other peers maybe exited businesses because they were losing money, that is certainly -- has not been the case for Maxim. And because of what we provide, the innovation and the benefits to our customer, it is a win-win. John William Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then Tunc, as my follow-up, given that your strategy is to focus more on the flagship, there's a pretty strong evidence that suggests that maybe that's no longer a strong unit growth market. And so I'm kind of curious, as you look out over the next several years, what kind of content growth do you think you can achieve in that flagship bucket? And kind of what are the key applications we should be thinking about driving that content growth? Tunc Doluca : So just to make sure that we're clear about our strategy, we do -- obviously, our leading-edge products go into the high-end smartphone space. And most of our revenue there comes from our power SoCs or power management products and also some comes from our sensor products, our optical sensor products. So our strategy, in general, is at the high-end, get more design wins with some of our other technologies, and those are audio and MEMS. And also, be able to add other sensors that are new, that are not even out there, functions that we don't have in current smartphones. So kind of broaden the technology base, that's one angle we're going with on the high-end. And on the mid-range, we see that much of the IT and technology we develop for the high-end phones can actually be repackaged up and wins design, and we see this in Chinese manufacturers, where we can win designs for our power management products, and we're getting revenues from that now. And we also see that in the future, some of these functions that are in high-end phones are going to migrate down to the mid-range phones as well. So that's another growth opportunity for us. So it's really both diversifying on the technology side, but also taking that technology and repurposing it into the mid-range phones, that's part of our growth. And as we've said before, the other piece of the strategy is to get more wins at other customers, not just remain at our largest customer, but diversify that revenue base. And we're definitely making progress on that front as well. So it's really mid-range and high-end, diversify the customers and get more technology or more dollar content per phone. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So my first question is on the industrial end market. It had a strong quarter here in June, but it looks like you're expecting a little bit of a slowdown in September. Now is that just simply because of seasonality? Or is there anything else going on there, maybe distributors getting a little bit concerned about inventories? Tunc Doluca : It's -- we really see it as seasonality. We really have not seen much of a signal of concern about inventory levels. We did quote the days of inventory, and it's really getting back to where, in our opinion, it should be, frankly. So I don't think we're seeing a growth of inventory in the channel in the industrial front. So for the core industrial business, it's basically seasonality. The first half has historically been stronger than the second half of the year. And that's offset a bit by our vertical business, which really doesn't have that seasonality, it's usually when our customers win their tenders and so on. So it's the combination of those 2 things. We don't believe it has to do with inventory build. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Very well. And as my follow-up, obviously, the flagship business and model is going to be down quite a bit in September quarter. But I think you also said there will be some offset from a new platform. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on that. Is that a new platform with the same customer? Or is there something else going on there? Tunc Doluca : What's in my prepared remarks, what I was really talking about is a new platform at our largest customer that's going to begin to ramp. And in that platform, we -- if that platform goes to production as planned, we expect to have more content than last year's platform, so that's good news for us. But I was talking about that, it was not another customer or another application. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division : If I could just follow right up on that, because I thought you made comments about a pushout in a new category, and that being -- you have talked in the past about adding to your diversity of your customer base this year. Maybe you could just elaborate on that, what you were expecting and what you're seeing now. Tunc Doluca : All right. Well, this is -- I did mention in my prepared remarks of a new consumer category. It's one that we have been working on for a while now. As I said, we do expect some revenues from it to add by the end of the year. And that's pretty much where we need to leave it at in terms of discussions. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Maybe a similar question, when you look -- I hate to bring up last year. You took the reset in June, September. It helps offset some seasonality. That customer typically has a down December. Could you see a similar trend as last year? You talked about a new platform at that customer, that should help offset. Just any perspective as you look into December, as you ramp any new content at new customers plus, just seasonality with your lead customer? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes, Blayne, this is Bruce. I'll take that. Certainly, when we talk about our largest customer, I think we all know they have their normal year-end inventory adjustment. Given our sort of limited visibility into demand and channel inventory, it's hard for us to predict if it's going to be any different this year than in prior years. But we generally assume they're going to do some level of inventory correction. As you said, that same customer is ramping a new platform. That ramp starts this quarter. And then, really in the December quarter, it kind of depends on how well that product does out in the marketplace, but that is -- can be an opportunity for us. But in addition, I think as you referred to, we do expect revenue from our other Mobility customers. It should be up meaningfully in that quarter. We'd still have to wait and see how everything goes, but as kind of -- as we look at it today, I think we feel good about the progress we've been making. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from ISI Group. Ada Menaker - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : This is Ada calling in for C.J. Could you maybe shift gears a little bit and talk about the China LTE build-out, kind of how long do you see that continuing and where do you see upside after that cycle's complete? Tunc Doluca : So essentially, the China LTE build-out, obviously, has been good for us and many other semiconductor suppliers. We -- but the thing -- the fact is that it's been rather lumpy in the past, and we don't expect that to really change too much. That makes it kind of difficult to predict the future. As I said, we did grow our revenues very healthily in the past year. And looking forward, I think it's pretty hard for us to really predict. But it's not a huge portion of our business, and that's probably the most important note I need to make, which makes us really not a good indicator of how that market's going to do in general. But I think that, from where we're looking at it, it looks like it's going to continue. But I think there are other chip suppliers that are probably a better indication of where that market is going. And as I said, it's not that big of a portion of our revenues. Ada Menaker - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And for my follow-up, could you provide some additional color on the data center side of things? Maybe an update on the progress of integrating and proliferating the Volterra products that you now have. Tunc Doluca : Yes, sure. So as you know, we've now completely moved Volterra into our business. We really do like the technology that we've seen. We've -- just to give you -- I'll use this opportunity to give you an update on that, we did see some headwinds, as everybody knows, in the OEM suppliers that everybody's familiar with, that are mostly in the U.S. However, we do see great opportunities for this technology in cloud data center applications that are not the OEM customers. And we definitely have found that because of the acquisition of Volterra by Maxim, by a company that has a much bigger presence in the market, many doors have now opened to us in the companies that are -- the cloud, let's call it the cloud companies, and we're seeing tremendous opportunity for us to be able to grow the comm and data center business, both from the Volterra side and from the optical side. So from that viewpoint, we've seen it being very beneficial. We also found -- we were kind of guessing at this, but we weren't sure, but we also found that the technology and the capabilities of that team are helping us out on the Mobility side as well. Some of the technologies of high current delivery of low voltages, it turns out it's getting more and more interesting and important, even in tablet and smartphones. So what we're seeing is -- just to summarize, we are seeing the headwinds from the traditional server customers that we had. I think that went through like a minimum, probably last quarter and recovered in the June quarter, somewhat. And -- but we're seeing, and a lot more excited about new opportunities we're seeing with a set of customers as well, that are either in the communications space, classical communication companies, or in the cloud space. And those revenues obviously will not contribute right away, but as we said, they will start picking up in the coming years. Hope that was helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike McConnell from Pacific Crest Securities. Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Just wanted to follow up on Blayne's question. So do you think your mobile revenue will bottom in the September quarter? Tunc Doluca : Yes, that's going to be a little bit difficult to predict but what we can tell you is what our -- what the puts and takes are. And from our viewpoint, I think there's -- if all the programs occurred in the timing that we expect it to occur, we think that we should get better results in Mobility. But I think I've put enough words of caution in there about timing and so on at customers. Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then regarding utilization rates, I believe you had said previously you're in the mid-70s. Where do you think you will be in the September quarter? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes, Mike. This is Bruce. So yes, we did increase from 64% in the March quarter to about 75% in the June quarter. So we did see that increase we were expecting. I think for this quarter, given the lower revenue, we're probably going to dip down to around 70% from an internal fab utilization point of view. Again, that's something we can -- we're always actively managing, our split between internal and external. But right now, with the lower revenue, we're looking at for a small drop in that utilization. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets Canada : I had a question on the target, and Bruce, I apologize if you addressed it already. At the Analyst Day, you said 30% op margin, it was a completely different run rate versus I'm sure what you're expecting, because you alluded to the fact that things changed over the last weeks, few weeks. So what's the right way to think about it? Is this going to be top line driven? And you expect a big ramp back half of the year? And if not, then is it going to be more on the OpEx side? And then I have a follow-up, as well. Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. I mean, I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we're still committed to that 30% operating margin in Q4. I think, again, as we said at Investor, that's assuming sort of the industry grows as expected. But I think it's going to come from both. I mean, but the current revenue weakness that we're looking at in the September quarter is near term, and it's sort of related to kind of products that we're selling currently. And it's too early to tell if this will impact our Q4 revenue. Certainly, as we've kind of talked about, our revenue opportunities outside our leading customer are all on track. I'm confident we're going to fix gross margin, and that's going to improve as we get inventory controls better. And as you can see, we're going to continue to tightly control OpEx. So the messaging that we gave during Investor Day, the goals around that from a financial model, that's something we're still aggressively working towards and are committed to. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. And then my follow-up is for you, Tunc. I and I'm sure everybody along with me who's listening, we regard you guys as very good stewards of capital, shareholder capital. This consumer business, tablets are slowing down. It looks like it's -- now it's a secular trend of tablets slowing down. Handsets, it's just hard for anybody to pick the next winner. So the reason that you intend to stay vested in this segment is because you think, if I understand it correctly, you think that there is -- it has good profit margins for you and it can drive growth. But why not take that and invest in -- you have really great franchises. Your automotive business has grown, as you showed us at the Analyst Day, it's a much bigger percent of your business. So why not take investments away from here and put them in areas where you're building strong and defensible franchises? Tunc Doluca : Well, I mean, first of all, in all of the areas that we said we're investing in, we believe that we're investing in at the appropriate levels, whether it's automotive or industrial or communications and data center. And Mobility is one of them. So the way I really view where we put our money is, and we kind of look at what returns do we expect in each one of these segments and what's the risk profile. We -- when we look at the Mobility market, it is about 30% of the analog market, so it's not something you can ignore. And when we look at it, we don't really look at that we have to invest in Mobility, but what are the product lines inside of Mobility that are the ones that have the best returns for us. So that's the way we look at it. And what we see in Mobility is still a lot of growth opportunity. And there's a lot of growth opportunity even if the smartphone segment does not grow anymore. I mean, our share is still pretty small in the smartphone market, which means that we can grow it in a case where the growth is not huge. But the decisions are made based on each technology and product line. What is the growth opportunity for that? How profitable is it? How differentiated can we make our products? So we look at those, and depending on that, we move them within each one of these segments. Now Mobility is not just smartphones. I mean, we are investing in things that you mentioned. It might be slowing down, but it's still a good growth market in tablets. There's a whole new category coming up, which is wearables. Where that's going to exactly go, nobody knows right now. But I believe that there's some fundamental value that can be delivered to consumers, and I think it's a market where we actually have the technology and capabilities to make a difference. So that's a piece of Mobility. So in each case, we're looking at what returns can we get, what's the risk profile and what's the growth profile. Now in automotive, we've been investing in for many years. Almost 10 years ago was when we decided to get into it. So it takes -- it's a great franchise, but it takes a long time to build as well. So we really need to make sure that we're investing our portfolio of R&D into areas that have got all of these, that give us a good solid base, which we're doing with our industrial, comms and automotive, but also we have growth opportunities with our technology and our capabilities, where we can differentiate inside of Mobility. So that's why it's a portfolio that we manage. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division : So industrial markets, I understand September should be down on European seasonality. But how sustainable is the recent industrial outperformance? I know around 2011, you had this distribution sales training increases, they created a lot of new design wins that have ramped over the years. How are you going to keep the momentum going here? Tunc Doluca : So it's good that you remembered the, all the stuff we talked about back then. I mean, we do have -- we do obviously intend to continue to grow this business and we have taken some actions to make sure that occurs. We actually have a business unit that's actually dedicated, they don't design any products or have R&D, but it's a BU dedicated to grow the, what we call the small- and medium-sized customer business for the company, and most of that is industrial. This dedicated business unit really works jointly with our distribution sales force. And this model really gives us the ability to sell more of what we already got in the company. So really to extend our reach into the small and medium-sized businesses and market our products more aggressively to get more design wins. And we stopped reporting about it, but the number of new customers that we add, we do keep measuring it and it keeps going up every quarter. And our design registration numbers, those are also going up every quarter. So we're not just relying on what we did 2 or 3 years ago, but are still pushing it in innovative ways so that we can actually leverage our very broad product line and get it in front of more and more customers, more and more small customers around the world. So that's a very intense and focused activity in the company. Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division : And then, my follow-up. Your Sensor Fusion products for wearables, you talk about wearables, but you don't talk about the Internet of Things. Are you exposed to Internet of Things but you're not talking about it? Or you just chose not to repurpose your building blocks here, like sensors and microcontrollers? Tunc Doluca : We actually have not talked about it because it's a very broad subject. So we view Internet of Things that are any type of electronic instrumentation or gadgets that are connected. And typically, those are gadgets that are measuring something, reporting something or controlling something. And we are in the middle of it. And we have many products that go into what I would call Internet of Things. But I find that everybody's got a different definition of what Internet of Things is. Definitely, any product that we make that's wearable or any sensor that's connected through either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi is Internet of Things. And all of these products have in them what we make. I mean, that we have -- it can either use our sensors, we find customers in that space who are using some of our advanced microcontroller products, which have security, analog metrology, a very low-power micro in them. So we're seeing design pull for those. So we're basically in it. But in my mind, it's really not clearly defined what it is. It's a pretty wide swath of products that go out there. So we definitely have products that are going there. And definitely, wearables are -- I guess, you could call them, some of -- in a group of Internet of Things, even though they mostly interface with humans. So we're in it and we've got the technologies to be able to win in that market. And our biggest investment, I would say, is on the medical side of that market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Tunc, when you talked about the MEMS product as being something you're looking forward to in the wearables market, could you drill down on that a little bit? On MEMS, where are we in the development cycle? Are you shipping into production systems right now? And on the wearables side, which of the components you think in the wearables market are you most differentiated? And when do you think that market helps move the needle? Tunc Doluca : Okay. So there's, I guess there's 2 parts of that question. On the MEMS side, let me give you some -- I'll give you an update on that. So we do -- as you know, we did announce our first generation products. We did make some improvements in those, and got another generation of product now. Basically, the biggest thing we had to do was to reduce the amount of power consumption the product has, so we've achieved that. We do have the product that's got the best accuracy overall. But power usage turned out to be more important. We are shipping -- and we have a design win in a small volume smartphone. We're going to begin to start shipping that pretty soon, but that will be pretty modest. But it's a start. Essentially, we have to prove ourselves. We know we have made the technology work, but until you're in production, the rubber hasn't met the road. So the second generation 6-degrees-of-freedom product, we're engaged with multiple other customers, other than the one that I just mentioned. And we're seeing good responses to the technology that we're showing them. So we're -- we've seen some progress and I'm happy to see that we are seeing that progress. Now on your other question on wearables, where is it that we can add value. Clearly, we know we can add value on the power management side. We know we can add value on all the functions related to power management : charging and regulation and fuel gauging, functions like that. We know we can add value on the sensor side, and we have products and technologies of various kinds, actually, that can be used in wearables, whether it's the sensor itself or whether it is the signal processing that's required for the sensor. So, and we have touch, so we're capable. We've got programs going in each one of these areas. But I feel like the killer product in wearables is not really out there yet. And when that happens, I think there will be -- my belief is that there will be an explosion of demand for these types of parts. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Tunc, can you maybe spend a little time talking about some of the successes or what you're seeing in driving your highly integrated solutions outside of handsets? And what type of content growth that, that could be driving for you? Tunc Doluca : So outside of handsets, we're -- let me take it market-by-market, that's probably easiest to categorize here. So clearly, the high-integration products are very valuable in applications where there's either a power constraint or a size constraint in the application, or we can deliver better functionality or performance by putting together a complete solution for the customer. And if you look at -- in the medical space, for example, clearly, I gave that example earlier, where our new generation advanced microcontroller products, where we got a micro, we can put on a very accurate, precise high-quality analog front end to make measurements. Combine that with security features so we can lock down any data in a medical application, and really combine that with a micro that's ultralow power, which we've been able to achieve. That's a really good example of a high-integration product that can provide great value to the customer. And other examples that we can think about are in the comms market. We have some really advanced RF data converters, these are mostly D2A converters and they have, the old chips that have combinations of not only a very high-speed, gigahertz-speed DAC, but in combination with some digital upconverter technology that we also deliver to the customer, is another example where we've been able to differentiate and really make a difference for the customer's end product. We have examples in industrial for financial terminals, for example, those products are cases where you've got to combine security, you've got to combine the tamper-detection circuitry and many other functions on a single chip. And really give the customer an entire solution, that's been what's winning designs for us, because the customer knows that the product we provide, not only do, does all the functions, but it also is completely certified by Euro, MasterCard and Visa, so it's an easy way for them to get to their end market. So those are just a few examples I picked. Another one is in smart meters. Again, a core microcontroller, which is really the core of the system. And around it, we combine it with metrology to measure energy consumption. Again, we combine it with security features, and it really makes the best product out there, if you think about smart meters that are getting installed all over the world. So these are just a few examples, and it's a pretty long list. But I -- just for the sake of time, I'm going to just end it there. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : All right. If I could -- you mentioned touch in some of your earlier comments and in the answer to the last question. Touch has been an area where it's been on again, off again with you guys. Where do you think that can go? And do you expect any material revenues? Is this something we should be paying attention to now? Tunc Doluca : Well, the touch space is pretty competitive. We believe we have a different and a compelling solution. But I think the incumbents usually have an advantage because they're incumbents. We do have some design wins and some revenue coming from it, but it's still -- if you look at the rank order of the suppliers in that space, we're not in the top 5, and it's -- I don't think that's really going to change materially. However, we are finding opportunities to use that technology to combine it with some of our other products and that could be really useful in a very space-constrained, like a wearable-type product. So we see that as an opportunity. But I don't want to mislead, there's -- it's not like we have any design wins in that space either. But I think there will be modest revenues from that and it's really not going to make an appreciable difference in the next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Given some of the issues you've seen in the Mobility segment, are you rethinking at all just some of the long-term growth opportunities that you see in that market? Tunc Doluca : Well, we think about it all the time. It's not -- we think about it because it's part of our planning for the future, and we look at what the growth opportunities are overall in the market, and we look at what the growth opportunities are for each product line in terms of return on investment. So it is a market where the analog content is projected to grow at about 8% or 9% by market research analysts, which is very healthy growth, looking at the growth rate we've seen in analog for a long time. But we really look at it product line at a time. I mean, inside of Mobility, which are the product lines where we can deliver value and where customers are seeking that value from us. And we're making those decisions constantly, not just based on reaction to some overbuild of some inventory and weakness in demand in some old generation products. So it's not something that -- it's not really a knee-jerk reaction, it's something that we do constantly. Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. As a follow-up for Bruce, last summer, when you saw some reset, you opportunistically stepped up the buyback, how do you think about kind of the balance sheet today and buybacks at this time? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Sure. I mean, I think, obviously we're committed to that return of capital. You saw the increase in our dividend. We increased that by 8%. In addition, we do have -- we're always in the market and looking to buy back our stock. To the extent that there is any pullback near term, we will certainly -- we have a matrix that drives higher buybacks at lower stock prices. So we'll absolutely take advantage of any near-term pullback. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi from Needham & Company. Vernon P. Essi - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : Just sort of going back to, I guess, the sensor and MEMS discussion, and if you could give us any, I guess, understanding of the size of that revenue footprint versus, say, the core analog and power functionality you're bringing to the phone over time? I'm just trying to understand, over the next couple of years, how much of a scope creep you think you're going to have in that dollar content versus where you're at today? Tunc Doluca : I -- okay, so in general, we're -- we've talked about market growth rates and the SAMs that we're really going after. We've not broken down what that means in terms of individual product line growth rates, and I don't think we really want to do that at this time either. But directionally, what we see when we looked at our plans is that currently -- and we had shown that -- I'm trying to visualize the slides that Chae showed. But we're showing that today's revenues were about 3/4 from power, is what I remember from the slide, and 1/4 was from sensors. And going forward, what we showed as in the next few years, we expect that to be maybe about 50/50 between sensors and power. And I'm doing that from memory, and we can look back at the slides and make sure that was right. But that's pretty much what we see going forward in terms of the Mobility content. Vernon P. Essi - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, just to follow on that point, Tunc, how do you feel about the margin structure of the sensor side of the business versus the margins that you've had on power? There seems to be this prevailing thought process that sensors could be a lower margin opportunity over time. How do you feel about that over the next couple of years? Tunc Doluca : Well, it really depends on the type of sensor. We expect the margins to be similar to what we've seen in the Mobility market when taken overall. But I think, from a margin standpoint, I've no doubt that it would be more challenging on the MEMS side, and because that's a more mature market. But when we look at some of the newest generation products we bring out that have functionality that customers have not seen before, on those ones, we're able to maintain the margins that we need. So it's going to be a mix, and it's really determined by how differentiated your product is. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody. So I think the combination of those 2, probably going to end up approximately where we need it to be in the Mobility space. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin from UBS. Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Tunc, your most recent -- maybe if you can help -- in terms of the September quarter, what's the typical linearity for the industrial and the comms businesses? I understand that they had both really strong performances in June. I was wondering if there's any typical progression and if there's any opportunity for potentially a bit more demand later in the quarter depending on the state of inventories and general macro trends later in the quarter? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes, I mean, generally speaking, linearity throughout the quarter for us, we're relatively linear, right? We don't have any type of big back end. And so from that point of view, as you know, we enter a quarter about 60% cover through backlog. And generally, that kind of shifts evenly throughout the quarter. The only comment, potentially, is I think we all know, in like core industrial business, right, to the extent that Europe business slows down in August and then we all, historically, wait for after Labor Day and see what the POs look like to see if there's going to be any uptick in that. But I think over time, that's become less meaningful as MRP systems have gotten more sophisticated. So I don't think there's any big takeaway on the linearity within the quarter. Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the sort of data center power management business, in terms of Volterra and that product line. Can you remind us, with the upcoming Intel Grantley server cycle, what kind of opportunity that represents for the Volterra business? Tunc Doluca : Yes, so on the Grantley cycle, the design wins at Volterra, and we knew this going in, were slightly less than they were in the previous generation. So that's really not a surprise for us. But as I said in a previous question that got asked, we see a huge opportunity for that technology that we found in -- not in the traditional servers, but servers that are custom-designed by cloud companies. And in general, what we find is that the CPU still might be the same, it still might be an Intel CPU, but the -- some of the architectures are different, so it's not as standardized as it is. And as all of you know, if something is standardized, there's a lot of pressure on price. But what we're finding is that many of the cloud servers, because they have to pay for the cost of running this equipment, they're a lot more -- they're looking for a lot more innovation, and that's where we're seeing our opportunities, frankly. So we're more focused, not only on what the processor companies do, but more on what are the special requirements of the cloud companies. That's the focus of the company right now. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I was just curious on the Mobility weakness there, is it just a unit issue? Because it seems like you had gained dollar content on the latest generation at your largest customer. So I just was trying to clarify it's just a unit issue there versus really a dollar content change versus your original expectations. Tunc Doluca : Yes, it is a unit issue. I mean, we had said before that our dollar content has actually gone up, and it really is the number of phones that are being sold and how the inventory in the channel is playing towards that. So if we really -- when we really look at our numbers, and we also -- keep in mind that we don't really know how many phones get turned on by consumers, but there are market reports that we look at, and if you add up what the market reports are saying, it sounds like this quarter, we'll be shipping less than what the end consumer sale of smartphones are in flagship phones. So it really is a unit issue, it's not a dollar content issue. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then you've been trying to diversify your customer base. I think you mentioned you gained at some other major OEMs, not counting the Chinese. I'm just curious how you felt you did in terms of the dollar content gains at the other Tier 1 OEMs relative to what you were hoping to get? Bruce E. Kiddoo: Yes, Steve. This is Bruce. I don't think we're going to comment on something that's -- dollar content that's not yet out there. Except to say that we do think, overall, these businesses should be meaningful for us. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And last question, I just -- I think on the tablet side, it sounded like the cycles were a little bit longer. Do you have any visibility into when that might come back in? Because it sounded like you said you were being conservative, so maybe there's an opportunity that comes in at the end of the day, stronger than you might have hoped. Tunc Doluca : Well, I think on tablets, what we really were -- if we didn't convey it properly, I will. It's really the fact that the growth that was being expected from our leading customer is really not happening in terms of unit sales. Basically, that's it. It's -- and what we said was that consumers really are not replacing their tablets at the rate that they replace their smartphone. So that really -- you can see that as end demand is really not growing, because people are using the tablets they had that they'd brought previously. Bruce E. Kiddoo: And I think, Steve, in addition to that, it's just kind of worth noting that we've commented in the past, and Tunc commented as well, when we look at tablets and we look at our audio products, that's certainly an area where our technology fits well with that platform and that's a business, which for our audio business, we think we're growing that business through market share gains. Kathryn Ta : Okay. So with that, this concludes Maxim Integrated's conference call. We would like to thank you for your participation, and for your interest in Maxim. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please limit yourself to one question to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Jennifer, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Analog Devices' first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. We posted a press release and relating financial schedules on our IR website at investor.analog.com and I'd encourage you to follow along as we go through our results today. Our agenda for this afternoon's call will be as follows. First, I will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results. Then Dave Zinsner, our CFO, will review our financial performance in the first quarter and provide our business outlook for the second quarter. Then Vincent Roche, our President and CEO, will provide closing remarks. And after Vince's comments, we'll open it up for questions. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude special items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our historical results and our outlook. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release, which is posted on our Investor Relations webpage. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and our second quarter outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. Except as required by law, we don't undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us today to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast. And with that, let's get to the main program. Revenue in the first quarter came in near the very high-end of our guidance range at $772 million, decreasing 5% sequentially and increasing 23% year over year. Communications infrastructure and consumer applications exceeded our revenue plan while industrial and automotive were about in line with our expectations for the quarter. Revenue from communications infrastructure customers at 26% of sales decreased 4% from the prior quarter, as both wireless and wireline applications decreased sequentially. Communications infrastructure revenues increased 45% year over year and 14% on an organic basis. Consumer revenue at 12% of sales increased 1% sequentially. Within consumer, growth in portable consumer applications offset seasonal revenue declines in the sector. Over the past several years, we have been refocusing our consumer investments around performance-centric prosumer A/V and user experience-centric portable devices. In the first quarter, our consumer business registered its first year-over-year quarterly revenue increase in five years, growing 27% over the prior year's first quarter, which we believe is a good sign that the headwinds we were facing in the sector have abated. The industrial market at 45% of sales performed as expected, decreasing 6% sequentially as a result of fewer business days for ADI, our customers, and our distributors in our January quarter. Compared to the prior year, industrial revenue grew 21% in the first quarter and 11% on an organic basis. The automotive market at 16% of sales decreased 8% sequentially, as car manufacturers took their seasonal production breaks over the holiday period. The long-term trends for the electrification of automobiles remain strong, and ADI is very well positioned across infotainment, powertrain, and safety applications. In total, our core businesses of industrial, communications infrastructure, and automotive represented again 88% of our revenue in the first quarter and have combined for 11% compounded growth over the last five fiscal years and 14% growth in our fiscal 2014. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the quarter and for our business outlook for the second quarter of 2015. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on our first quarter 2015 P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $21 million. When comparing our first quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release. So with that, Dave, it's all yours. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Ali. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Ali just outlined, ADI had another very good quarter. Sales in the first quarter totaled $772 million, and diluted earnings per share excluding special items were $0.63. Gross margins of 65.6% in the first quarter decreased from the prior quarter's 66.4%, primarily as a result of lower factory utilization but were better than our plan on a better mix of business. Compared to the prior year, gross margins increased 50 basis points on a better mix. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory on a dollars basis was flat to the prior quarter and on a days basis was 126 days on lower sales. Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the mid-60%, and we're planning to increase utilization to the mid-70% in the second quarter. Inventory and distribution on a dollars basis was also approximately flat to the prior quarter and on a weeks basis was approximately eight weeks on lower sequential sales. Operating expenses of approximately $264 million declined $5 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to savings resulting from the prior quarter's restructuring action. Operating profit before tax of $242 million or 31.4% of sales decreased 180 basis points from the prior quarter but increased 240 basis points over the prior year. Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $7 million. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $5 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Excluding the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other special items, our tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 15%, which we expect will be our rate for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.63, as I mentioned, near the high end of our guidance and up 29% over the prior year. At the end of the first quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $2.9 billion, with $740 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, resulting in a net cash position of $2 billion. During the first quarter, capital additions were $24 million or approximately 3% of sales. Our capital expenditure plan in 2015 is to be between $150 million and $165 million. We have a strong financial model that generates solid cash flow, and we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. For the trailing 12 months, we generated $883 million or 29% of our sales in operating cash flow. We also generated free cash flow of $729 million or 24% of sales, and returned $790 million or 108% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of a dividend or share buybacks. Our quarterly dividend is a very important part of our total shareholder return philosophy. During the quarter, we returned $115 million to shareholders in dividends. In addition, today we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share payable on March 10, 2015. This represents an increase of 8% and is in line with our model to increase our dividend annually by 5% to 10%. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $60 million of our stock, which helped reduce our diluted share count by about 1 million shares. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $700 million remaining under our current board authorized share repurchase program. So now to our outlook for the second quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude special items that are outlined in today's call and release. After a solid first quarter, we are planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $810 million to $830 million or up approximately 5% to 8% sequentially. At the midpoint of this range, revenue would increase 18% year over year or at a high single-digit rate on an organic basis. By end market, we expect industrial and automotive to lead our sequential revenue growth and for the communications infrastructure and consumer end markets to remain stable to the first quarter levels. We are planning for gross margins to increase to approximately 66.5% on higher utilization and a continued favorable mix. We estimate that operating expenses will grow approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, which of course is well below the sequential revenue growth we expect to achieve in the second quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any one-time items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 in our second quarter. While this is solid operating leverage, our utilization rates are expected to be only in the mid-70% levels in the second quarter, and we continue to carefully manage our operating expenses. Based on our first quarter exit rate, we estimate we have approximately 500 basis points of operating leverage remaining in our financial model given that the high end of our operating margin model is 36% of sales. So to wrap it up, the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We had a strong year-over-year revenue growth with quality earnings and cash generation and we expect an even better second quarter. So now I'll turn the call over to Vince. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everybody. As I mentioned last quarter, during these calls, I will occasionally provide additional perspective on the markets and technological trends that are driving ADI's business and the growth opportunities ahead for ADI. Today, I'd like to give you some insights into our strategy in the industrial automation market specifically. This market is characterized by a diverse set of many thousands of customers and myriad applications with long life cycles. Customers not only demand highly innovative products and solutions, but these products and solutions must function at very high levels of accuracy, robustness, reliability, and efficiency in very harsh operating environments. These dynamics create high barriers to entry, making industrial automation precisely the type of market that ADI actively pursues for sustainable growth and attractive returns. Within automation, ADI has a long heritage of providing technologies and product solutions in such areas as programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems, field instruments, motor controls, robotics, and industrial sensing. This business has traditionally served a variety of factory and process automation customers in such areas as automotive, pharmaceutical, and chemical manufacturing and then among many others. But today our customers' customers are responding to unprecedented challenges in an effort to remain globally competitive and boost productivity while decreasing energy costs and their carbon footprints. Our customers are focused on increasing the agility, the safety, and the reliability of their manufacturing systems. Facing the scope of these challenges, customers are racing to re-architect their system designs and are working to transform yesterday's factory floor into the connected enterprise of tomorrow, and this transformation is showing up on ADI's bottom line. In our fiscal 2014, sales into the industrial automation market represented about 25% of our $1 billion-plus industrial business growing 14% compounded over the last five years, far outpacing the growth of our served available market. And we were very optimistic about our continued growth in this sector. Let me explain why. The industrial automation sector is largely about precision sensing, monitoring, control, and communication. We have spent the past 50 years building our expertise on our brand with our high-performance precision analog and mixed-signal processing capability, where we can supply thousands of products to our many thousands of industrial customers at sub one part per million quality levels. In recent years, we've been increasing our product development and systems engineering investment in this area. In addition to our data converter, linear, DSP, RF, and MEMS portfolios, we continue to broaden our reach with the addition of, for example, isolation products. We are better positioned than ever to understand our customers' signal processing system needs in order to deliver more complete solutions that anticipate and address their pain points. Now I'd like to give you a couple of examples of the results of these investments. Today, in the area of process control systems, our customers need to maintain several hundred manufacturing platforms that are hardwired and dispersed all across factory floors. Not only are these systems inefficient but they require teams of service personnel to roam the floor and manually ensure each individual system is operating effectively. A couple of cogent examples will explain how we're changing the game here. For example, ADI's product designers have produced a groundbreaking highly integrated software-defined signal processing solution that has the ability to reduce our customers several hundred platforms down to just a few that can be individually reconfigured with software to adapt to the various applications needs. This helps make customer systems more flexible and agile while decreasing their maintenance and service costs. In addition, ADI's software configurable platforms enable customers to pack 50% more channels into the same or smaller form factor without performance compromise and at the highest safety and reliability levels. Another example, more than 40% of the world's electricity is consumed by industrial plants with inefficient industrial motors consuming most of this electricity. In these applications, ADI is enabling highly precise measurement and control to enable our customers to create the highest-accuracy, efficient, and reliable motor control systems. In these same applications, our isolation products are increasingly becoming a key differentiator for ADI, enabling machine and operator safety by isolating the electronics from high-voltage operating conditions. Also, our MEMS sensors are increasingly coming to the fore in industrial automation and are a key differentiator for ADI. In machine health monitoring applications, for example, our MEMS vibration sensor with an embedded radio frequency transceiver enables remote monitoring of industrial machine health to detect early machine failure and to save our customers' customers from costly plant downtime. So in essence, these are the forces driving what many of our customers call Industrial 4.0. Our customers are increasingly relying on ADI's signal processing system domain know-how, our products and technologies, and we are very well positioned to capture the opportunity and to drive revenue growth for ADI well into the future. And so with that, we'd be very happy now to take any questions you might have on any part of the prepared remarks here. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Jennifer, can we get to the Q&A, please? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the really strong results and guidance. If I could ask first on the consumer side, it's terrific that that \u2013 that the issues in that segment seem to have kind of played the course and don't seem like they're going to be acting as a headwind going forward. Do you think that the resolution of the issues in that segment is more just the fact that the segments that you are letting roll off kind of fully played out or do you think you've actually gained some share in that segment that's enabling that segment now to be not a headwind anymore? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good question. I think it's largely a case of the headwinds being largely behind. We have been building some core technologies using some of our precision technologies, for example, to develop some new products that will come on stream in the future here particularly in the portable area. But I think it's really a mixture of \u2013 I think as I said the headwind is largely behind us and I think we've got some tailwinds now that will propel us through the parts of our business, the two areas that we focus being prosumer, the audio/video prosumer area and the portable area where we've been, I'd say, modestly investing but doing some really exciting things that's have been and will come to fruition in the not-too-distant future here. James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Terrific. That's helpful. And for my follow up, if I could ask Dave. Dave, you mentioned utilization going to the mid-60% I think next quarter. Can you give us the range where that's been over the last couple of years kind of high and low? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think it's actually, Jim, it was the mid-70% for Q2. James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm sorry. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : It was mid-60% for Q1. And I'm just kind of scanning through it. It peaked out in the second and third quarter of 2014 in kind of the mid-70%. Let's see. I'm just looking in the low. It probably got down to about 50% \u2013 in the first quarter of 2013, at least, it was 50%. I'm not sure beyond before that. James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So we're getting back to a pretty healthy level here in the next quarter? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : We're getting into the mid-70%. We have \u2013 I would say that in 2011 \u2013 of course that was heady times \u2013 but in 2011 we were in the low-80%. So we certainly can operate this facility at a utilization level that's much higher than we are today and we would get obviously the incremental gross margin fall through from it so that's not out of the realm of possibility. James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's terrific. Really, really helpful. I appreciate it. Congratulations again. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jim. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jim. And, operator, before we move on to the next question, just a reminder that we'll have everyone try and keep to one question as the call will run until 6 :00 and so feel free to re-queue after asking your first question. We'll get to our next caller now. Operator : Our next question is from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Can you give us any feel for the communications infrastructure end market by geography? Are there some regions that are relatively strong and others that are relatively weak at the moment? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd say America has been strong. We're still \u2013 everybody is waiting for Europe but I think it's been really a story about America, China, to some extent Japan and Korea. We had some good strength in India as well over the last couple of quarters. And, I think we're expecting China to continue to be reasonably strong at least for the first half of the year in the TV systems. And again, we expect a growth year this year in communications infrastructure for ADI. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Can you just talk about what the Hittite contribution was during the quarter and then how you expect that to play out for the rest of the fiscal year? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Hittite was in kind of the mid-$70 million level, which was kind of consistent with where we thought it would range. Obviously, in the back half of the year, we're thinking that it's likely to be up from where it is today. I would guess that the second quarter is going to be \u2013 given that we think communication is going to be relatively flat, I would guess Hittite is going to be relatively flat too. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And revenues there, please? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I beg your pardon? Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Revenue, too? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : That's what we're talking about. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, got you, got you, got you. I thought you were talking about margins. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Oh, no, no, revenue \u2013 yeah, that was revenue. Yeah, margins are consistent with where Hittite's margins have been historically. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is the time of year when new pricing kicks in on value purchase volume purchase agreements. Can you give us a sense of what impact that's having on your quarter going forward if that was in line with what you've seen seasonally in the past or more or less? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : It's more or less in line, although we've taken a lot of steps around pricing to get more discipline and this year I think we did better than in years past in terms of the agreements with the key customers. We've also really kind of scrutinized our pricing across the long tail as well to make sure it was kind of consistent with the value that we're providing and in some cases actually there was a little bit of an increase. So I think we did pretty well on the pricing side. It was generally very stable through the negotiations and I would think through 2015 we'll have very, very stable pricing. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thanks for that detail and congrats on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you Operator : Your next question is from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and nice job on the dividend increase, guys. The question is really just a clarification. You noted that there was upside versus expectations in consumer and communications infrastructure. To what extent was it much more one or the other? And given that consumer contributed to the upside why did mix play a role in better gross margins? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think they were both equally as strong. I don't think there was one specific area that outshines the other. From a mix perspective, generally actually our consumer business has pretty good gross margins. They're up north of 60%, so they actually don't impact our margins as much as you might think. And obviously, communications is above the corporate average, so that's very helpful to our gross margins. So that's generally why the mix turned out to be a positive for us this quarter. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the gross margin guidance just a little bit. So we've got about, I think it's 90 basis points of upside, but we have utilization going up 10 points or so from the mid-60% or the mid-70%, better mix, higher revenues. I'm just trying to figure out. How do we think about the relationship between gross margins and utilization on a point-for-point basis? And are there any headwinds that are affecting the margin guidance as well that are offsetting some of the tailwinds that seem to be there? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think the general rule of thumb is usually that for every 1% increase in utilization, you get 10 basis points of gross margin improvement. We're roughly guiding in the 66.5% range. It obviously could be better. Certainly there are a lot of good things happening in the gross margin side. And the second quarter mix is generally a bit better because industrial has good strength in it, which is what we predict. And of course the utilization should lift it up. There are always a few things that kind of can go against you. And I think given that's the case, we generally factor that into the gross margin guidance when we give it. But like you said, it could go a little bit better. I think the fall-through on gross margins for the second quarter \u2013 Ali, correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 is 80%. Right? Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : That's correct. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : And that's all also a good rule of thumb. As revenue goes up, you generally get 80% fall-through, and that tied to the 66.5% which is what we go with. But this quarter was a perfect indication that we can't exactly nail it down to the electron, to the tenth of basis point, and so there could be upward momentum depending on how things go. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : And, Dave, not only has the gross margin dropped through at 80%, at the midpoint of guidance, but the operating margin is also around 70% drop-through. So thanks for the question and we'll go to our next caller. Operator : Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys, this is actually Matt Diamond on for Ross. Congrats as well on the results and the guide. There has been some talk about changing seasonality in the industry. I'm curious. From a bookings perspective, how does the current bookings dynamic compare to normal seasonal to the extent that normal really applies? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I actually think that \u2013 I would say that the cycles seem to be less predictive at this point. But seasonally, I think things are happening as they normally happen year to year. We saw bookings obviously come down initially in the quarter, and obviously were soft through the Christmas period. But after that, the bookings levels did ramp up in the January month. And February up until this point was quite strong. So it's consistent with \u2013 and of course that momentum happened a lot in the industrial and automotive space. So it's consistent with the guide that our opinion is that industrial and automotive should see very good sequential growth this quarter. And there's a lot of stability around the other two end markets, consumer and communications infrastructure, which generally would be a positive indication that those will be stable through the second quarter. And that's pretty \u2013 the second quarter generally for us seasonally is a very good quarter, and I think it's lining up to be a very good quarter for the second quarter. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Matt. We'll get to our next question, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you. I was hoping you guys could talk about the M&A environment. As you've probably heard, Micro out looking for strategic alternatives. Freescale is reportedly for sale. So if you could, just talk about that. Are you guys getting pitched a lot of deals and what's your appetite these days? Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Bankers have to earn a paycheck, and so they've always been interested in pitching us deals regardless of whether it was a good environment or not. But in any event, we do have an active acquisition program in place. That was how we got to the Hittite acquisition last year. I think for us it continues to be about, what do we think is going to be important for our customers for us to have in terms of technology, and then we look out across the universe of opportunities to see if we can find that technology and companies, be it relatively smaller or large. And so generally, if businesses are getting shopped, I wouldn't say that incentivizes us either to do it or not to do it. Really we start fundamentally with this list of what are the things we want in our portfolio that we don't think we can do organically, and those are the things that drive us to do acquisitions. And at this point now, nothing to talk about; we continue to survey the landscape, but there's nothing active at the moment. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our job number one for us, Romit, is to make sure that we shelled out a significant amount of money to buy a great asset in Hittite. We are determined to make sure that we create the leverage that we believe is available both on the top line and the margins and in terms of building up a really important $1 billion-plus franchise here for RF and microwave. So that's job number one for us at this point in time. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Then, just to that point, you've been very vocal that any potential acquisition has to be strategic, and that was one of the clear merits to the Hittite deal. But I wonder looking at what's been done over the last year, in particular the Avago-LSI transaction, if you're more open-minded to doing something that may standout more from a financial perspective? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : We're not in the business of doing things just strictly for financial reasons. We've got to have strategic merits for us to do it. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: For us, it's really about making sure that the combination of ADI and Hittite is capable of creating something greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, we can put our two pieces together and, over time, produce growth that was beyond the reach of both companies separately. So we're well on track, I'm delighted with the response from our customers. We have some great examples just very, very lately in fact where in the communications sector in particular, the Hittite, there's a tremendous vein of really good engineering and technology there that the customer relationships, the breadth of coverage that we have in the channel, that we're bringing Hittite now to places that we had hoped were possible to bring Hittite based on just ADI's scale, depth, and breadth. So I'm very, very pleased so far with what I'm seeing. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the great results. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, and congratulations on the strong quarter and outlook. On the solid industrial trends in the business, I'm interested in the regional trends within this segment here in the April quarter and what sub-segments in automation, instrumentation, healthcare, energy are you seeing strength? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : For the second quarter? Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, for the second quarter. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think our two biggest sub-markets are industrial instrumentation and automation and those we expect to have very good second quarters. Healthcare is probably going to be up a bit, but it'd be relatively modest. I think defense is probably going to be relatively flattish. Energy management, which are smaller component, are likely to be a little bit up. Geographically speaking, obviously, the two major markets that industrial serves is the U.S. and European markets. When we looked at the bookings levels for those two markets in industrial, that's supported a pretty meaningful increase for the second quarter on a sequential basis. So I think those two areas will be probably the ones that outshine the others in terms of performance. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thank you very much. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Harlan. We'll get to our next question, operator. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. On Hittite, understanding that some of the revenue synergies will take time to play out but can you give any early stage anecdotes in terms of things you're looking to do with the distribution channel or customer engagements after closing Hittite? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's a lot of activity. During the past three months or so, we launched Hittite into our channel. So we've gotten the attention of our biggest distributors globally and we've put more than 1,000 product SKUs into the distribution channel. So it will take time. But the response \u2013 I've spoken with these distributors myself and the response has been very, very positive to creating leverage and expanding the reach of Hittite across the globe. You know as well I just mentioned that we've seen some terrific evidence of deeper penetration of Hittite, particularly into some of our larger customers as well where the engagements, the combination of ADI's mixed-signal with Hittite's very, very high-performance analog, RF, and microwave technologies, that combination is starting to change the game in terms of the kinds of conversations we're having with our customers. So for example in the instrumentation area, we've gone from competing against each other on product sockets to having a conversation about how that customer manages their frequency plan across their entire product portfolio. One of the very large routing companies is working with us on some very advanced technologies that Hittite has brought us in particularly the cable area. So there's lots of empirical evidence that the combination of the pieces and ADI's just breadth and coverage of customers globally is making a difference there. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for the color, Vince. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. My question is really on the automotive segment. So, Vince, you've done very well over the last few years, but when I look at the last two quarters, automotive sales have been roughly flat to modestly up which is somewhat different than what we have seen from the competitors. So is this just order lumpiness? Do you think you have a complete portfolio in automotive? What will be the catalyst to turn automotive segment back to what overall company growth rates can be? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, good question, Vivek. So automotive for ADI, 2014 was actually a strong year for automotive for ADI. We grew at three times the SAAR and have done so also over the last four years or so. So 2014 was a good year. I believe 2015 will be a growth year for ADI. We believe that the long-term projection for this business I think we said publicly should be that we can grow this business at a minimum of twice the rate of SAAR and I think the business as has been in the past is capable of growing three times the rate of SAAR. So it's a very sizable business for ADI now. We've done well in the past. I believe it's a terrific growth opportunity for ADI in the future. I mean that said, it's a lumpy business to some extent given that there is really probably 10, 15, 20 customers that really matter, big programs that tend to last a long time. So I think the way to look at it is that some years we will achieve 3x, some years we won't. So \u2013 but I think overall, you've got to look at this business over the long-term. We've been increasing our investments. We've got terrific diversity now in terms of customers, products, and there's a lot of new things happening in automotive in terms of safety systems. We've got some exciting new technologies that we've been introducing as well into the real technology purveyors out there in terms of things like noise cancellation, infotainment, powertrain. So I think the future is going to be very, very bright for the industry and for ADI. Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. I'll add my congratulations on a nice quarter and guide. Dave, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you think the share count might look like in the April quarter or at least the magnitude of share buyback you guys might be contemplating? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Good question. I guess I have to be somewhat of a prognosticator of what I think the stock price is going to do over the time. I mean generally speaking, if the stock is strengthening through the quarter, we would unlikely be buying. Yeah, that's the right way to say it. Because we tend to buy when there is kind of historical weakness in the stock and when there's not, we tend not to be a buyer. So I don't know exactly what's going to happen through the quarter. I hope it actually goes up and to the right. But the way we've modeled it is we thought that the share count would be in the kind of 316 million, 317 million range. It's possible it could go a little lower than that. It's possible it could be a little higher than that. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you, and congratulations on the record revenue outlook. Vince, I wanted to follow up on the industrial automation segment. I think you said it's grown about 14% CAGR the last five years... Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...which was a period when industrial automation sort of just scratching the surface as far as the opportunities. So should we expect that business to potentially accelerate from that growth rate, and do you have other sub-verticals within industrial that have that same growth profile? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's a good question, Tore. We've been, generally speaking, increasing R&D in the industrial space over the last several years. We've been strengthening and broadening the portfolio, the signal processing portfolio. So I think we are making our basic products and technologies more attractive to our customers, the industrial customers. We've also, incidentally, been increasing the footprint of our field operation in terms of selling an applications resource over the last five or seven years, developing the relationships, building the engagements at the engineering level. So I think we're in a good position in terms of products that we've got the coverage that we've got in the industrial space. And also, our customers \u2013 as I said in the prepared remarks there, many of our industrial customers are asking us to get more involved in helping them instrument the sense to be able to create information for them and communicate information about machine health, for example. So my sense is both in terms of the things we are doing organically as a company and what the market will enable ADI to do, it will be a bright future. I think also, in the instrumentation area with the addition of Hittite, we're able to do new things in the microwave sector and instrumentation, in aerospace and defense, for example, as well. And I think everybody is expecting a lot from the energy sector and it's been lumpy. It's based on regulation and government mood and so on and so forth, but it's an area where we've got some good technology on the metering side, on the communications side, and we have a broad portfolio of products that sell into the transmission and distribution of electricity as well. So \u2013 but I think in terms of being able to create leverage here I think automation is going to be strong for ADI, particularly strong, and as I said the high-frequency part of instrumentation I think is going to be good for the company as well. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions and congratulations on strong results. Relative to the guidance in April, if industrial and consumer is sort of stable/flattish Q-on-Q, it means the other two buckets \u2013 I'm sorry industrial and auto need to grow about double-digit sequentially. I'm just kind of curious is one bucket growing faster than the other? And I hate to use the word normal seasonal, but would you characterize double-digit sequential growth in the April quarter as normal seasonal or are there other drivers like content growth that you think is starting to kick in at the April timeframe for those two buckets? Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You're correct in that's roughly what has to happen. I think that the industrial business will, on a percentage basis, do better than the automotive business sequentially. And actually I think there is \u2013 it's hard to gain a lot of share in industrial in a quarter. This is a business that doesn't move quarter-to-quarter, it doesn't even move year-to-year in a lot of cases. So if you look at the sequential growth rate in the 2014 second quarter, I think industrial grew at about 13% sequentially and that's been kind of the range of what we're probably talking about for industrial for this second quarter. So it's basically seasonal. We'd like to believe that we have invested a lot in automotive and in the industrial space. We've moved a lot of R&D away from some of the more high-flying consumer opportunities and into these areas over the last five or six years. So all of that takes time to get traction, and I do believe that 2014 and at least how things are lining up for 2015 for those markets, does indicate that we've got some momentum in these businesses and that the fruits of the labor of all this R&D investment that we've made over this five-year period is starting to pay off in terms of revenue design wins, design-ins and so forth. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Helpful. Thank you, guys. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Dave, in your prepared remarks, you talked about 500 bps remaining in terms of operating leverage. Curious if you could talk a little bit about your underlying assumptions there in terms of what kind of top line mix utilization you require to get to that kind of number? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I mean the margins of these businesses \u2013 of course there has been some mix impact quarter-to-quarter in terms of the impact to gross margins, but I think largely they're fairly close to each other. I don't think we have to rely on one business doing better than another business in order for us to kind of hit the targets. Our goal is to get to 68% gross margins. And given that we're 250 basis points below that, I guess, at this point, 250 basis points of the 500 basis points is going to come from just gross margin leverage, which is largely going to be a function of, we believe, factory utilization, a higher top line- over some fixed overhead expenses, and just a laser focus on this in terms of pricing discipline and cost discipline. And I think we've been able to do a fairly good job in both of those areas over the last couple years to improve the gross margins beyond where they would've been. And then the rest is obviously trying to get the operating expenses down a couple hundred basis points as a percent of revenue and that will get us the rest of the way there to get us our 500 basis points of improvement. I don't think it's going to happen next quarter. Obviously, I don't know that it happens next year necessarily. But I think in a fairly stable environment with some growth like we think we can do over the course of four or five years, I think we'll have a very good steady march towards improving that operating margin leverage that we talked about. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Very helpful, thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Thank you, guys, pretty solid execution here. Just on order trends, Dave, is there any difference in European order trends at the distis versus here given the currency upheaval that we are seeing? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : You mean orders from distributors on us you mean? Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right, right, given that they are sitting on depreciated currency. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Obviously, the currency moves around a bit. We transact mainly in dollars. And so sometimes they get a windfall in terms of gross margins; sometimes they don't. But their business is shipping our product and so they're going to need to hold the inventory to be able to do that, and we don't think they're going to adjust their inventory behavior based on some FX perturbations. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And then your earlier response you did say \u2013 I just want to make sure I got it right. For the guidance, you did say that you expected both European and the U.S. geos to be strong? Correct? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Correct. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Communications segment down only 4%. You thought it could underperform the other three segments. I'm just trying to understand how your comms business can outperform FPGAs. You've heard Xilinx talk about a flat to low-growth environment they're facing this year, and your converters do often sit next to FPGAs. I'm just trying to understand the source of the outperformance. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is another area where we've been investing heavily in increasing ADI's reach across the radio subsystem over the past number of years. So as we've said several times, our content from generation to generation has grown, and that is the case in, for example, 4G today as well where we're getting somewhere between 20% and 30% more BOM value per 4G radio subsystem. And also ADI in terms of diversity of that radio application is stronger today than it's ever been. Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC : Helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question, another one on geographic demand, if I could. Relative to Japan and China, could you talk a little bit about how the order trends are looking in those two geographies, especially in the industrial end market? Is it still in correction mode, or do you sense a trough coming anytime soon? And also any foreign exchange related impact to longer-term orders, especially in Japan? Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : At this point, we're not seeing any impact from FX changes. I think in general, industrial \u2013 again, it has a pretty good second quarter, so I'd expect those businesses to do okay. I think we have generally \u2013 I don't necessarily remember how it breaks down by segment. But I think in total, we expect China and Japan to be relatively flattish. So my guess is industrial does a little bit better and some of the other markets probably do a little bit worse, and that nets it out to relatively flat. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne, Agee. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Good quarter here. Just on the automotive side, can you talk about which segments you are seeing strength in automotive? And also geographically what's your exposure in automotive? Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Geographically, we're probably more concentrated at the European automakers to start with, and then a close second is the U.S., followed probably by Japan and Korea at equal levels. The strength I think for the second quarter on a sequential basis, my guess is that we'll see strength across all three of our sub-segments, infotainment, safety, and powertrain. I don't think any particular sub-segment is going to do necessarily better than any of the others. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Just for round two, can I sneak in two quickly? Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Yes, go ahead. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): You talked about the end markets. Can you just maybe give us a sense of the ranking of end markets you expect as far as growth goes for the calendar year? And then also, would you characterize your overall environment as better than seasonal? And what do you think the drivers of the better than normal seasonality would be, if it is like that? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Better seasonal for the year you mean or... Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Would you characterize like the current orders environment as a little bit better than normal environment? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : That's the same question I thought we got a little bit earlier, but I think that it's generally pretty seasonal in terms of the order flow. And then as far as we rank the end markets, it's a little early to be able to try and do this but I think all four markets will likely grow this year. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I would hope so. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Now we obviously get a lift in the industrial and communications markets by virtue of the fact that we have Hittite in there. So obviously they're likely probably to do better than the other two because they get a full year's effect of Hittite versus one quarter's effect of Hittite that we had in 2014. And then consumer is probably the next and probably auto is going to be the slowest this year. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question is from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : They're all recycling. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC : We're coming back in, just one more for you. I know you guys have been working on improving some of the margins in the MEMS business. Can you give us where you're at in the progress of that program? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : On the baseball analogy, I would say we're in the second or third inning. We do have some products that are starting to come out that carry better margins. Obviously, they take some time to get traction. My guess is that traction doesn't happen until late in 2016, maybe 2017, and that will be an inflection point for us in terms of improving gross margins. We're obviously focused on the cost side of the equation as well and we've made steady progress. So margins are improving, but they still have a ways to go to get to where we think they'll be acceptable. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC : What percentage of sales should we characterize MEMS as now? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : It's in the mid-single digits I think. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark J. Lipacis - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Dave, I think this one is for you. Accounting Bulletin 606 on revenue recognition, it seems like it's effectively trying to eliminate sell-through revenue recognition and it's already causing some companies to rethink there \u2013 how they recognize their revenues. Have you guys looked at this? And if so, can you tell us how you think this may impact you guys and when you might expect to implement it and would it cause you to recognize a big chunk of the $280 million in deferred revenues in one quarter? Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : That's the first time I've ever gotten an accounting question, I think. I feel so honored. Yeah, the \u2013 we are aware of the Bulletin. It does seem to indicate that at some point down the road the sell-through way of recognizing revenue might go away. I think in a couple of years \u2013 I'm not even sure what year this all starts to come about \u2013 I think it's like 2017, 2018. So we have a ways to go before we have to worry about it. I'm not even sure whether you kind of restate history and then as if you had never done revenue recognition on a sell-through basis. So we will have to see how that goes. It's quite a few years away, though, so we haven't spent a ton of time worrying about it. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Mark, for ADI, I'd say it's probably effective in our fiscal 2018 here, so we've got plenty of lead-time here to deal with it. Mark J. Lipacis - Jefferies LLC : Fair enough, thank you very much. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : And if there is, like, some one quarter kind of impact, what we'll do is we'll provide some sort of pro forma schedule so that it's very easy to tell how we've done from quarter to quarter so it doesn't cause an issue. Mark J. Lipacis - Jefferies LLC : Sounds good. Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Deepon Nag with Macquarie. Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about how the tax synergies with Hittite are progressing and, longer time, how are you guys thinking about balancing your needs for onshore cash with a falling tax rate? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : The tax structure of Hittite is now kind of fully integrated with our tax structure. At this point now, we're pretty much realizing effectively a lower tax rate for Hittite. There's probably a little bit more that will fall through by the time next year rolls around, but I think for the most part the big step function improvement has already happened. You are right, we constantly balance U.S. kind of cash flow needs and international cash flow needs over time. I think we have plenty of cash in both locations and certainly plenty of liquidity beyond the cash that we have on the balance sheet. I think to be able to manage both entities effectively without kind of a meaningful adjustment to our tax rate in the event that one particular entity needs cash and the other can provide it there may be some cash flow that moves from one location to the other and that would have some effect on the tax rate but it'd be relatively minor and I don't think would have a big impact on earnings. Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks. And if I could sneak one quick one in on small cells, just how design traction of that business and how we should think about that as a percentage of your revenue over the next couple of years? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, the design activity has been tremendously successful for ADI. We've been working hard on building a set of transceiver technologies that are highly integrated in terms of the RF and the mixed-signal chains. And as I said, we've great design in coverage across the globe. And it's my expectation that somewhere in the late part of this year into next year we'll start to see it become a meaningful portion of the business assuming that the rollouts take place at the rate we expect. It's hard for me to give you an exact prediction in terms of what proportion of our revenue, but I think it's true to say that from what our customers are telling us and what the carriers believe that the deployments will begin in the second half of this year in earnest some time. So when they happen, we'll benefit very, very well I believe. Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: That's great. That's all I've got. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : And I would just add, Deepon, on the small cell thing. A lot of times it comes down to the definition of what's a small cell versus what's a macro. The miniaturization of the macro base station has been happening for several years. In fact, I think if you look at the stats on some of these macros, they're actually placed about 50 meters apart. So do you call that a macro or do you call that a small cell? But in any event, I think our sense is that the small cells in the back half of 2015 should start to layer on top of what we're doing on the base station on the macro side. So overall, it should be a good year for us in comms infrastructure. So with that, let's get to our next question. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks. Just a quick one. I believe, Dave, in response to a prior question you mentioned Hittite was about mid-$70 millions in Jan and you expected it to be sort of flattish in April. If you could clarify that. And just on a like-to-like basis, how should we think about the growth at Hittite in fiscal 2015? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Actually, now to think about it, the industrial business is likely to have a pretty good second quarter, so I probably \u2013 I was thinking about it from the comps perspective, but yeah, so of course the industrial will go up. So I guess sequentially Hittite will be up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And then what was your second question, Vivek? Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yeah, just for the full-year, conceptually from the time you acquired Hittite and where you expected the growth rate to be. Now that it's been under your belt for a couple quarters, how are you thinking about full-year growth trends for that acquisition? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : It's going really well. I think the likelihood is that this thing is going to grow kind of in the double-digit range and that was what it had been consistently growing at for a while. It had a couple years just like everyone else where it wasn't doing that, and then it turned around and started to do pretty well. So that's pretty consistent with what we thought. I mean it wasn't too terribly different than where we thought things would end up. I'm very excited, as Vince pointed out, that there is a whole bunch of new designs that Hittite was unlikely to have gotten had they not been part of the ADI portfolio, and Hittite has actually helped us in some cases win some business on the signal processing side that we wouldn't have ordinarily had gotten had it not been for having the microwave capabilities. So the business is performing at least as good as we thought it would, but I think that the revenue synergies that we'll get over the long-term are going to do much better than we thought we would going into the acquisition. Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the follow up, guys. Back to the consumer segment, with the re-tooled product portfolio, is the consumer business now a business that can grow on par with the rest of ADI's businesses? And if not, is it north or south, and what kind of visibility do you now have in that business? Is it short-term, a quarter or two or is it longer-term with the mix of applications that you now have exposure to? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think it grows at the levels of the rest of the business now. Thankfully not a headwind. Of course consumer is a little bit lumpier so there may be years where it does did better than that, years where it does a little worse than that. But I think in general that business should grow around the corporate average. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just add to what Dave has said there, Craig. So we're not interested in a business as you know that hasn't got legs to it over the long-term. We like sustainability, we like diversity, we like good returns. And I think in the consumer area, we've been very, very clear that with our customers, give us the problems that are really, really hard to solve, and those are the problems we've been getting. Also, not just one generation at a time, we are building this business, albeit the innovation cycles are, they're short, they're very, very rapid but as best we can, we are able to see at least a couple of generations out from the existing solution, if you like. So we are trying to apply our algorithm, if you like, for the rest of ADI where we're trying to build a long-term view in the spaces, a few targeted application spaces particularly in the portable area, as Dave said, where we think we can get good sustainable growth over the longer-term. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, just a quick follow-up. Dave, you guided OpEx to be up 2% to 3% sequentially which is sort of half of the rate of your top line growth. Is that how we should think about OpEx growth for fiscal 2015 as well as sort of half of your revenue growth? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : For the total, you mean? Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Correct. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, and I haven't quite done the math but I think in general what we're trying to do is have it average around what the fourth quarter of 2014 was. So I think the fourth quarter of 2014 was about $270 million and so we're roughly thinking we'll average that over the course of the four quarters of 2015. So that probably does have the effect of half the rate of revenue growth but I guess it obviously depends on what the revenue growth rate is and I'm unable to predict beyond the second quarter what that's likely to be. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very good. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Okay, thanks. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : All right, Tore, well, thank you. And I'll throw it back over to Vince to close out the call. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks, everybody, for the questions on the call here and hope you are as excited as I am about the results and the future of ADI. We continue to focus our investments on profitable, diverse, and sustainable markets where, as I said just a while ago, there are tough problems that need to be solved and where the barriers to entry are high. We also have a culture. We just turned 50 by the way and what has sustained this company over the 50 years and will bode very well for the company in the future is that we've got a culture that's driven by innovation, excellence in everything that we do, and a real passion for solving the deepest challenges that our customers are dealing with. And it's my sense that this will be a great business for many, many decades to come. So once again, thanks for listening in, and we look forward to speaking to you at an upcoming conference or at next quarter's earnings call. Operator : This does conclude today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good afternoon, my name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question and answer period. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining Analog Devices second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. We have posted a press release with relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com and I'd encourage you to follow along as we go through our results today. Our agenda for today's call is as follows : First, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results, then Dave Zinsner, ADI's CFO, will review our financial performance of the second quarter, and finally Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO will provide our business outlook for the third quarter, along with closing remarks. And after our prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Now the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we've reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on our investor relations website at investor.analog.com. And with that let's get started. Now, as you've likely seen from the press release, after a very good first quarter of fiscal 2015, ADI produced another strong performance in our second quarter. The strength of our innovation, the diversity of our business, and our strong execution drove revenue to a record $821 million, which is an increase of 6% from the previous quarter and an increase of 18% from the same period a year ago. By end market, industrial, automotive and consumer exceeded our revenue expectations for the quarter and offset what was a weak wireless infrastructure CapEx environment. The industrial end markets, which are typically seasonally strong for ADI in the second quarter, grew 11% sequentially and represented 48% of our total sales. All of the major application areas within industrial grew sequentially with the strongest growth coming from the aerospace and defense, instrumentation and industrial automation sectors. By region, sequential industrial revenue growth was strongest in North America and Europe. Now the industrial market is truly the lifeblood of ADI, where we developed and deployed our high-performance signal processing technology and system domain knowledge across our tens of thousands of industrial customers and their myriad applications to help create more intelligent, robust, connected and energy efficient products. Revenue from automotive customers at 17% of sales, increased 13% sequentially, and 3% year-over-year, in a seasonally strong period for ADI's automotive business. Sales increased sequentially across all of our automotive focus applications in powertrain, infotainment and safety with particular strength in both advanced driver assistance systems and in powertrain applications, as car manufacturers respond to consumer demand and pending government mandates that help make vehicles safer and more fuel efficient. The consumer end market, at 13% of sales, grew 15% sequentially and 40% year-over-year, marking the second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue increases in consumer for ADI. Prosumer audio-video was stable both sequentially and year-over-year with portable applications driving our consumer growth this quarter. Our consumer strategy remains the same. We plan applications where our high-performance technology allows us to solve our customers' toughest challenges and where we can make a meaningful difference to the user experience. Revenue from communication infrastructure customers at 22% of sales declined 10% sequentially following a 4% decline in the prior quarter. A weaker than planned wireless infrastructure market, particularly in North America and China drove the sequential revenue decrease. We believe that these declines are temporary and that ADI will continue to benefit as 4G penetration rates increase from their current low levels. Revenue from wireline customers represented about a third of our communications infrastructure revenues and was stable to the prior quarter. So, now I would like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the quarter. With the exception of revenue and other expenses, Dave's comments on our second quarter 2015 P&L line items will exclude special items which in the aggregate totaled $26 million. When comparing our second quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter results and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release. So, with that, Dave, it's all yours. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Ali, and good afternoon everyone. The second quarter of fiscal 2015 was another very good year for ADI and revenue totaled a record $821 million. Gross margin in second quarter of 66.5% was well within our model range of 65-68% and was up 90 basis points from the prior quarter as factory utilization rates increased to the mid-70%s from the prior quarter's mid-60%s level. Inventory on a days' basis in the second quarter increased by one day to 127 days, and on a dollars basis, increased by $27 million, with approximately half the increase relating to the positioning of inventory for higher expected sales in the third quarter, and the balance of the increase relating to the timing of customer demand. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors increased by 5%. Most of the increase related to the Hittite product catalog, which was added to our distribution channel in the quarter. On a week's basis, inventory and distribution was lean at approximately seven weeks, down from the prior quarter's approximately eight weeks. Operating expenses in the second quarter increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 6% increase in revenue as we continue to gain more operating leverage in our model. As a percent of sales, operating expense in the second quarter declined 140 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Operating profit before tax as a percent of sales increased 230 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 200 basis points from the same period a year ago, and at 33.7% of sales was well within our operating model range of 32% to 36%. Other expense in the second quarter was approximately $4 million, and was lower than planned on a small gain on investments. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $5 million per quarter for the remainder of 2015. Our second quarter tax rate was approximately 15%, which we expect will be our non-GAAP rate for the remaining two quarters of the year. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share of $0.73 increased 16% over the prior quarter and 24% year-over-year, and was near the high end of our guidance range. At the end of the second quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.1 billion, with $760 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding which resulted in a net cash position of $2.2 billion. During the second quarter, capital additions were $49 million, our capital expenditure plan in 2015 is to be between $160 million and $165 million. We have a strong financial model that generates solid cash flows, and we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders. For the trailing 12 months we generated free cash flow of $830 million, or 27% of sales, and returned $800 million, or 96% of that free cash flow to shareholders, in the form of a dividend or share buybacks. In addition, our capital allocation strategy supports a regular dividend increase of a 5% to 10%, and last quarter we raised the dividend 8% from $0.37 to $0.40. Today our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock, and that will be paid on June 9, 2015 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 29. So in summary, this was a very successful quarter for ADI, the strength and diversity of our business combined with our strong operating model generated strong cash flows and converted a 6% sequential revenue increase into a 16% earnings growth. So now I'll turn the call over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, are on a non-GAAP basis, and excludes special items that are outlined in today's call and release. Vince? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everybody. As we've talked about in today's remarks, the second quarter was as you've seen a strong quarter for ADI on several fronts, and I'm very proud of our execution. As we start our third quarter, order rates continue to be stable across the industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure markets, which leads us to plan for demand in these markets to be similar to the second quarter levels. In the consumer end market, we have had good order growth and are planning for another quarter of sequential growth in that sector. In total we expect revenue to be in the range of $825 million to $865 million. The mid-point of this range represents a 3% sequential increase, and a 17% increase on a year-over-year basis. Given the expected mix in our business, we're planning for utilization rates in our fabs to be slightly lower in the third quarter. As a result, we expect gross margins in the third quarter to be approximately 66%. We anticipate operating expenses to increase approximately 2% to 3%, a modest increase from the prior quarter, primarily the result of a full quarter of annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share is anticipated to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.77 in the third quarter. Beyond these near term events, our basic philosophy, and the cornerstone of our strategy remains the same : superior innovation drives superior business results. We possess the broadest product portfolio system and manufacturing capabilities and high-performance signal processing to solve our customers' toughest challenges at the intersection of the physical and the digital worlds. Our product development strategy is to identify the fundamental challenges that our customers are facing in our target-application areas, and leverage our solutions across as diverse a set of opportunities as possible. This strategy is evident in the breadth of our product portfolio and the diversity of our markets, applications and customers, where we harness the strength of our portfolio and where barriers to entry are high and where our innovation can be sustained. Today, customers are choosing their long-term partners very carefully, and our engagements with them are occurring earlier and earlier in their innovation cycles. And our collaborations are becoming longer term in nature. There is no limit to the level of innovation that they are demanding from ADI, and we're responding by continuing to push the boundaries on technologies, products and systems engineering. An example of this approach in action is our acquisition of Hittite, where we are building an RF and microwave signal processing portfolio that makes ADI even more relevant to our customers, and helps them solve their ever-increasing design challenges. Our brand remains stronger than ever, and our employees are engaged and passionate about our customer's success, all of which provides us a terrific platform upon which to continue building our strong franchise. Our drive for innovation and engineering excellence, and our deep systems and applications domain knowhow enable ADI to stay ahead of what's possible. We are focusing on the right markets and products that will drive sustainable and profitable growth and superior shareholder returns well into the future, and I firmly believe that our best is yet to come. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Vince. So, everyone, during today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question. We're going to run today's call until 6 :00, so after you ask your primary question, please re-queue if you'd like to ask a second question. The reason we do this \u2013 we run our call in this format is that everybody gets a chance to ask at least one question. So with that, operator, let's start our Q&A session. Operator : Our first question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much. You were talking about how your gross margin will drop a bit because of loading, although, of course, it's difficult to forecast what revenues are going to do going forward. Do you expect to be able to raise your fab loadings going forward after this current quarter? Do you expect your inventory to where you want it to be at the end of this quarter? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I wouldn't say that I anticipate inventory to be where we want it to be. But a lot of why our inventory is where it is, is not related to running the fabs hotter than expected. It really is about, in fact most of it is actually wafers we outsource externally. So I think a large part of our kind of utilization is driven off of the industrial business. And depending on how that business goes, that would somewhat determine how our loadings go. But we're obviously expecting that business to do well over time. And we anticipate that our fabs will continue to increase over time, the utilization levels. So I think that would be over time a positive impact to the gross margins. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah, David, this is Ali here. I would just add that look at only the third quarter for us, we tend to do some retooling anyways in our fabs, so it tends to be a slower quarter on the utilization side as a result of that. So I think it's kind of a seasonal thing. And the other thing I'd add is on the gross margin line : we're running our business to run and operate at gross margin model ranges of 65% to 68%, and so that's still the case and that will still continue to be the case going forward. So, thanks for your question, David. And we'll get to our next question, operator. Operator : This question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks, guys. I guess just as a related question, can you give us your expectations for the relative growth rates of the end markets I guess for the rest of the calendar year? And then if you would maybe talk about your expectations for relative growth rates longer term, say for the next one to three years from the end markets. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think it's safe to say, given that the third and fourth quarter are usually good quarters for consumer, that as we sit today with the limited visibility that we always have in the semiconductor space, that we would expect the consumer business to do quite well for the latter half of this year. I think industrial generally sees, on a half year to half year basis generally starts to flatten out for the second half of the year. That's generally true of the automotive space as well. And in the communications business, I would say is a wild card. We do expect this to be a temporary perturbation that we're experiencing right now in the communications market, and that the long-term trends to build out infrastructure around the world still exists, and the need for more data or higher data rates still exists. So I think it's matter of when on the communications business, but that should come back at some point, and may indeed come back in the fourth quarter. Longer-term, we hope all of the businesses grow quite well over the next three years. And I think as we look at the pipelines in each one of our businesses, and Vince and I just reviewed it a few weeks ago with the team, we're excited about every one of our end markets and the things that are getting done, the incredible innovation that's going on together with our customers. And so we expect all of them to do quite well. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think as well, Chris, we've put a number out there. We've said that our expectation is that we should be able to grow this business and aggregate it two to three times global GDP, and we stick by that. My sense is if the markets behave, we'll be on the higher end of that. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks Chris, and we'll get to our next question, operator. Operator : This question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Dave, you've always said that mix of business doesn't have a significant impact on the gross margin line, but if you look at the strength in the consumer going into the July quarter, and the incremental gross margin in that quarter being relatively weak, I think I understand the issue with utilization. But can you remind us again how consumer influences gross margin longer-term, and I guess, given where it is today as a percent of revenue, how big would you want consumer to be before it got sort of too big? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, on the gross margin front, I think what we're talking about with our guidance is we'd be 50 basis points off the second quarter gross margin level and roughly probably half of that's impacting us from utilization and probably half of that is mix, and so it's again, relatively modest impact that we get off the consumer business in terms of mix. We actually will take all comers in terms of good profitable innovative type revenue streams. So we don't \u2013 we're not going to arrest any market that's going to do well for us and drive revenue growth and, more importantly, earnings growth. I think that, though, just based on the way we're investing our R&D, which has been very balanced across all of those end markets I think you'd expect that we'll have a very balanced growth trajectory for all of the businesses, and thus you probably won't see significant differences in percentages by end market over time. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: To add a little more color to what Dave has just said, we're leveraging a platform of technology for the portable space in particular that is based upon our many, many years of developing precision signal processing technologies for many different types of applications within portable devices. So, as always, we're solving the toughest problems that our customers can throw at us, and we're looking for sustainable innovation. We're looking for sockets where we can sustain a position for generations to come. So that approach will give us the kinds of ASP's and the kinds of margins that we find attractive to our business overall. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, guys, that's helpful. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : And this next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question guys. I wanted to focus a little bit on a follow-up to the points that were just being made. In the consumer business, there have been some tear-down evidence of a marquee design win for your product. Can you talk about your ability to drive your technology across a broader base of both customers and applications? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, as I've just said, we're leveraging technology that is primarily precision centric. That we, for example, if you look at our philosophy in general, how we do the innovation inside the company, we generate, very often break-through process technologies, break-through circuits, break-through products from which we build platforms, and ultimately those platforms are purposed into industrial automation, into battery management in cars, into portable devices in consumer. So it's very much a platform play, and where we can leverage the quality and the strength of our technology, and solve really difficult problems in those areas, we build products very often that sometimes go into a catalog, and sometimes are purposed for those individual applications. So that's the philosophy, and our technologies as you know, we've got more than 20,000 product SKUs in the catalog of ADI. We've got about 100,000 customers across many, many different applications. So that's been the approach in the past, it's served us very, very well and I believe that approach will serve us very well in the future. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Craig. And let's get to our next question, operator. Operator : And your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I just actually wanted to follow up on that. As you look at the consumer space, you have been able to put up a good barrier from competition in industrial type markets. When you look at consumer, you are leveraging that precision signal expertise, do you think you can enjoy similar barriers to entry, and if you could kind of highlight the competitive landscape in portable applications? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the portable landscape itself has a lot of different modalities within. There's many different sensor types, many, many different types of media. So, as I said, we have very much picked out areas of the portable space where the problems that are really important to our customers to solve, to develop a really high-quality user experience, those problems are very, very tough, and so we are pushing our technology right to the edge. We're living at the edge of the technology. And we're enabling certain features to be provided in these systems. That's where we like to play as a company, whether it's industrial, automotive, consumer, communications infrastructure, and we apply that everywhere we go. That's the philosophy of the company. We like solving tough problems at the intersection of the physical world and the world of digital or virtual. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Blayne. Get to our next question, operator. Operator : And this next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just a question on the cash return. You guys have done a great job over time doing that, and I think you've laid out clear targets. When we boil it down between the buybacks and the dividends, I think you've said in the past you have roughly a third of your free cash flow generation is onshore, and by that math, it looks like your dividend is actually more than your onshore. I know you have a ton offshore, but just talk about how you balance that with the statement you made earlier in the call about increasing your dividend each year. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I mean, well, we obviously have a U.S. entity that generates cash flow, and so some of the dividend is supported by how much of the U.S. cash flow is generated. Beyond that, as you've probably noticed, we have added leverage at times. I think we have a couple of bonds now outstanding to bulk up the cash reserves of the U.S. entity, and we utilize that cash as well to fund the dividend and buyback, and of course offsetting that, the international entity accumulates cash, so net-net, we have a pretty good balance sheet, pretty conservative balance sheet, but we do use leverage on the U.S. balance sheet in order for us to fund the buybacks and dividends to create the share \u2013 or cash return that the shareholders want. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And this next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. So, I just had a question on your guidance, and I do recognize that most of your end markets are sort of moving into flattish seasonality, but just based on conversations you're having with customers, especially those in the industrial space, I mean, does it feel like they are upbeat, or are they being guarded, cautious? Just trying to understand directionally what your customers are feeling after what was a fairly turbulent March quarter. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think there's kind of two sides of the conversation with industrial customers : one is the long term, and how we're working together to generate great innovation in industrial instrumentation and so on and so forth. We've had a very, very good industry quarter in the quarter just gone. Sequentially it was strong. It was up considerably year-over-year, and I think it's really going to be a question of how well the macro environment behaves. So, my sense is it's stable. We see it in the order rates and we hear it in conversations with our industrial customers as well. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : This question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to ask a bit about the automotive end market. You mentioned that there were some pending government mandates in autos. Is that Euro 6 or is it something in the U.S.? Any color would be helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Hey, Will, it's Ali here. So, yeah, I think specifically what I was mentioning in the prepared remarks is certainly around Euro 6. It's also around the CAFE standards in the U.S. that are coming online. But I think I did mention government mandates, but I think it's above and beyond that, right. So, there's NCAP standards, there's five-star ratings, and I think a lot of the car manufactures are really angling to hit those ratings, get those various certifications, because I think it really helps them to differentiate their products with the end consumer. I think those are the kinds of things that are coming online. And, interestingly, customers are also adding the various options, right? So, something may be part of a particular government mandate, be part of a particular NCAP program, but customers are actually now, particularly in the premium vehicles, are opting for the various functionalities, and so I think that's also been really good in driving our business. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: To add a little more color there to what Ali has just said. So obviously car companies, it's important for them to comply with government regulations, but car companies are in a massive transformation mode. I mean, they're all trying to become IT centric, because that's how they're really building value into the products that they're developing and delivering. And I think there's many, many years yet of head room to innovate in cars as the OEMs themselves are trying to automate and electrify everything they can inside the car. So I think that's more the driver of innovation than regulation. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And this question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Vinayak calling for Craig. I had a follow-up on automotive, like solid sequential growth this quarter. And when you look at the portfolio, you're playing in the right applications. When I look at the growth on a year-over-year basis, the growth has kind of slowed down to the low single-digit range from high single digits, double digits in the prior quarter. How should we think about growth like in the intermediate to longer term in automotive? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so, look, we've had a very, very strong growth pattern in automotive over last several years. We've been growing at a compounded growth rate of around 20% over the last five years, and when I talked earlier on about the aggregate expectation for growth for ADI, I talked about two to three times global GDP as being kind of a good benchmark. And my expectation in the years ahead is that given where we are now that the higher end of that growth expectation is what automotive will deliver for ADI. So I think that's how to think about it. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : This question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Hey, good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I guess my question's on the consumer side. Great job in terms of that business finally triumphing and some interesting wins that you've alluded to in the past. Curious what kind of growth we could see for that business here in calendar 2015? And based on that kind of growth, what kind of impact would that be, all things equal, in terms of impact to gross margins? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, as I mentioned on the gross margin front, most of these businesses are pretty close to the corporate average. So within 20 basis points, 30 basis points. It's not much different. I think we'll have to defer until next quarter to really give you I think a good sense of the full year of growth rate of consumer. We're just not ready to provide complete guidance out through the year on any of our businesses, because we just don't have that visibility. I think it's safe to say, though, that as we sit today, normally consumer has a seasonally strong fourth quarter, and that's kind of how we're building the internal plans at this point. But we'll wait until the third quarter is behind us. We'll give you some better clarity around the fourth quarter and that'll give you a sense for the full year growth rates. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Thank you. Operator : This question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the shorter-term outlook here. So, obviously, very strong, consumer was up 15% this quarter, you seem to be guiding it up more than 20% next quarter. Flat in the rest of the other businesses. You're talking about core industrial and auto again usually seasonally weaker in the second half. Comms is a wild card. You're taking their internal utilizations down, which to me suggest maybe a little bit more caution potentially in those core businesses. I guess, do you think it's possible \u2013 can we actually see growth in the second half outside of consumer, for the rest of your businesses? And would you say your outlook for the second half in industrial and auto today is maybe better, worse, or the same versus where it was three months ago? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, I mean, even if industrial stayed relatively flat through the rest of the year, they'd be up, because the first quarter was a pretty down quarter for industrial as it usually is. So I guess the answer to your first question is yeah. I mean, I think there is certainly an expectation, or could be an expectation that we could see growth second half over first half of the core businesses. What was the second part of the question, Stacy? Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm sorry. Just, would you classify your sort of industrial and auto kind of core outlook into the second half today better, worse, or the same as where it was three months ago? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think we generally are in the same range that we expected coming into the year. This is \u2013 obviously there's all these crazy macro indicators, some of which contradict other macro indicators. The best we can do is look at our order flow. And I think recently the order flow has been pretty stable. We did have maybe a weaker February partly due to the Lunar New Year, I suspect. But outside of that those businesses have been pretty stable all the way up until today. So, of course, we don't know how things will \u2013 with 100% confidence how things will look like going forward, but just based on the customer input, what we've heard from our distributor partners, and what we're seeing in terms of the order levels, I think it's a pretty stable environment. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : And this question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Vince, given the deployments, the LTE deployments, that we've seen already some of your competitors are a little bit more guarded about their communications businesses recovering over the next year, and I'd be curious why you're more optimistic? Thank you. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, look we're at very, very early stages of 4G build-out across the globe. The penetration rates are still very, very modest. There's a long, long way to go. We've obviously had the short-term wobble, but that is short-term. I mean it's really \u2013 it's centered around a couple of carriers, behavior of a couple of carriers that had a strong ripple effect throughout the entire market. So I think the long-term prognosis in terms of the build out of hardware infrastructure to be able to deal with the bandwidth, with the data capacity requirements, there's no question about that. I think also we talked on the last call about the emergence of small cells, and we are very, very well positioned in the small cell sector that will compliment the strength that we have in the macro area, so we've a stronger product portfolio than ever, we're very, very well positioned with all of the OEMs across the globe. So I believe the short-term has really been, as I said, a behavior issue with a couple of carriers, but I think in the medium and long terms this is a great space to be. And I think we're going to see a recovery here sooner than later. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : This question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Unknown Speaker : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. I just want to \u2013 I have a question regarding Hittite and its contribution for this quarter related to the prior quarter. And can you talk about how the split has changed between the communication and the industrial? My understanding is 40% is in industrial and 60% is in communication. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Okay, let me take the first one. The revenue growth sequentially of the Hittite business was basically the same as the total company's. So it performed exactly as expected, and we're very pleased on how they did on a top-line basis. Also we were expecting for 2015, I think when we originally talked about the Hittite acquisition that it would be kind of in the high single digits in terms of accretion. And I probably updated this last quarter, but I would just tell you that it looks more like it's in the 10% ZIP code this year, and we feel really good about Hittite's accretion for next year, which is likely to be in kind of the mid-teens. So from that perspective it's going quite well. The business had \u2013 I think that's probably fair to say \u2013 had a bit more industrial as a percent of revenue versus communications. And obviously communications wobbled for us, it wobbled a bit for Hittite, the Hittite portion of the business as well, not surprisingly. But one of the areas of the industrial space that did particularly well for us this quarter was the defense business, and that is where Hittite had very good exposure. And so they definitely knocked the cover off of the ball in that category within the industrial space, and, so, it did quite well. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Operator : This question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thanks. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the Hittite accretion question. Dave, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what we should think about OpEx over the next six quarters, if your OpEx grows something maybe half the growth of revenue, does that suggest we should model something even less growth on OpEx. Is that the right way to think about it? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think for the most part, most of the OpEx benefits of the Hittite acquisition are kind of in. What synergies we got from an operating expense standpoint, I think pretty much were captured by the time the first quarter ended. There might be a little bit, but it's not enough to move the needle for the total company in terms of OpEx. Where the next wave of synergies comes from with Hittite is in the cost of manufacturing, and that's as we transition their test operations from Chelmsford to the Philippines. And so really where you see the next wave of benefit is on the gross margin line and not the operating expense line. So personally I think your rule of thumb, roughly, OpEx growing at roughly half of the rate of revenue over time probably makes a lot of sense. Certainly there'll be quarters where that doesn't necessarily happen, and there will be quarters where we do a little bit better than that, as we did this quarter, but over the course of several years, I think that that's a pretty good rule of thumb. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. As I think about industrial, it seems like medical could potentially become a bigger area. You guys talked about some very interesting medical solutions at Analyst Day. Does medical become 5% of revenue sometime in the next year or two, or is it more \u2013 it will still take ten years to get that, to be a big percentage of revenue? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, I'd say we're not \u2013 we wouldn't break it out for 5% revenue. So it's a healthy business today. Where we might break it out as separate category \u2013 thank you. Where we might break it out as a separate category is when it got closer to the kind of 10% category. That would be kind of the reason to bring it out. But it's actually a pretty meaningful part of the revenue particularly of industrial. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, just to add a little more color there. It's a space with tremendous potential. It's the one area of our business where technology in many, many ways, IT is going to be the solution to many of the problems to be able to produce the kind of diagnostics that are important for healthcare, even for wellness and healthcare management. And to solve the cost problems that are just really crucifying that industry. So it's very, very important to the overall delivery of healthcare from a performance and cost standpoint. It's a modest investment for ADI, but we're very excited about many of the things we're doing in delivering photonics solutions, for example, in the area of CT and MRI scanners. So big iron is an important part of what we're doing. We've built some really enabling technologies in digital X-ray that are starting to ramp up into decent sized revenues, and of course there's the vital signs monitoring for kind of consumer plus applications and moving into clinical grade healthcare over the coming years. So there are several areas with a very modest R&D spend that is allowing us to create tremendous leverage again off the technology platform that we've developed. So it has all of the attributes that we look for in terms of hard to solve problems, multiple generations of sustainability. Good ASP and margins, so I think it's a terrific space. And it's one of these spaces where you really have to take a long-term view to playing in. Because things don't happen overnight, but I think we're very well positioned and excited about the future there. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : This question comes from Gabriel Ho with BMO. Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi this is Gabriel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking our question I have a follow-up on the communications end market, I think you mentioned during the Q&A session you are well-positioned in small cells, and I think also you mentioned before that you see 4G has a higher, 20% to 30% higher opportunity than 3G. So how should we think about the opportunity in the small cells as it ramp as opposed to 4G and 3G? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's very hard to say. I mean, there's definitely \u2013 the introduction of these small cells \u2013 by the way, when we talk about small cells, I should make it clear, we are not talking about femtocells. We are talking about high-performance infrastructure-related small cells. So I want to make that clear. The introduction of those small cells, we've said for several quarters now, we believe that the second half of this year we'll see the introduction in a meaningful way of these products, and that indeed now is beginning to happen. So I think second half of 2015 is when we'll see a meaningful introduction of those products. So, there's no precedent in terms of ASP increase for those products over the prior year, there really wasn't a prior, it's all been macrocell to date. But what we have seen, of course, and macro is an increase of 20% to 30% in bill of materials value to ADI based on the extension of our portfolio, and the integration of functions into our solutions there. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Gabriel, this is Ali. I would just point out. I think the long term trends of this market are terrific. I mean, you look at 7.1 billion subscribers out there, 4.5 billion are still on 2G. North America, barring the kind of the short-term perturbation this quarter, mobile data in North America is growing 50% year-over-year, penetration rates here are set to move higher over the next few years, and China is on this multi-year 4G FDTD build. So I think we're in the infancy here. And I think the points that Vince made are absolutely correct. Because you have the macro coming in. You have the small cell layering in on top of that I think it's going to be a great market for ADI for many, many years to come. Thanks, Gabriel. We'll move on to our next question. Operator : This next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC : Yes, thanks. Could you talk about your ability to handle volume ramps in portables? This is something you've done in the past, but not more recently? So, would you say you've been audited pretty well on manufacturing capabilities to fulfill requested lead times? Thanks. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we have one of the best manufacturing organizations in the world of semiconductors. We have a manufacturing organization that's been consistently irrespective of volume or market, we've been able to deliver greater than 95% of our products within six week lead times, no matter what the perturbations in markets, with sub-one-part per million quality level. So we're very, very agile in terms of our manufacturing capability. In the case of the consumer area, we're leveraging external foundries, and external \u2013 backend manufacturing and test capabilities. So, as I said, our supply chain is second to none in the industry, very agile, and we have a lot of experience, by the way, of playing in these consumer markets over many, many years. So, we're very, very much up to the challenge and pleased with where we are. Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC : Great. Thanks, Vince. Operator : This question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of insight in terms of how you're going think about the tradeoff between revenue growth and gross margins as you ramp some of your big consumer opportunities. Do you think you'll prioritize the revenue growth or would you prioritize kind of holding the line at a certain level on gross margins as you face the inevitable cost pressures in the second and third generation of these devices that the big customer kind of drives? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : I think we feel pretty confident that we can stay within the range of our gross margin target, which is 65% to 68%. But ultimately, we're about growing earnings at 8% to 15%. And so we certainly want to be on the higher end of that range if we can. And that's number one priority. What Vince I think said in the prepared remarks, I think he said \u2013 sprinkled through his answers on questions today, has been that we're very focused on innovation, and when you're focused on innovation, you don't necessarily see the competitive pressures that people see in every market that we participate in, because, if you come out with commodity parts in any of these markets we're in, you're going to find a lot of price pressure. What we try to do is stay on the innovation curve, ahead of the innovation curve, we get paid for that. We have superior \u2013 what we believe is superior R&D thrown at these problems. And so I feel pretty confident that you're not going to see us wobble away from on the gross margins. James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very helpful. Thank you. Good luck. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Sure. Operator : And this question comes from Joe Werner with Peter Cannell & Company. Joseph Blair Werner - Peter B. Cannell & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess I'm turning to the balance sheet, and we all know we have interest rates at the lowest level in our lifetime, yet I see that we have an exorbitant amount of cash at this time. At a time when many companies are borrowing money, we have cash that is earning very little return for our shareholders. So I wonder is there any thought being given to the idea of maybe borrowing a couple billion dollars instead of having a couple billion dollars on the balance sheet? Maybe \u2013 I remember when it wasn't long ago when the company had about 400 million shares outstanding, today it's close to the \u2013 got down to 300 million shares, now it's been creeping upwards to, well, I see 312 million on a basic number, but 317 million on a fully diluted number. By my calculation it could be down to about 250 million if we took on about $2 billion of debt and it swung the balance sheet. In about $4 billion, we could reduce our share count by about 20%, increase our earnings by about 20%. What type of response would the board have to that type of thinking? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, I appreciate the question, Joe. Obviously we're constantly looking at trying to optimize the balance sheet. Obviously part of the challenge is the fact that a majority of that cash is offshore, and isn't easily accessible, although it can be accessed. And we have to balance, I guess, three priorities. One is, I guess, a two-part priority which is to return cash to shareholders, focus first and foremost on the dividend, but also on opportunistic buybacks. And if you look at our cash balance probably back, I don't know exactly when that was, 2005 or something, I think we have come down quite a bit in terms of cash balances. The other priority is obviously to augment what we do organically in terms of development, with some inorganic, call it, development, Hittite being a perfect example. So at one point, we were at, I don't know, a year and a half ago, we were probably at $5 billion of cash, and we brought that down to $3 billion. It didn't necessarily reduce the share count, but I think, dramatically improved the earnings leverage within the company by adding incredible technology, very synergistic with what we're doing and also accretive right out of the gate. So, that's the kind of balancing act that we have as we kind of manage the capital structure. But I think as we look over the long term our goal is not to be accumulating tons of cash. It is to be very judicious, but very shareholder friendly in terms of returning cash, and also to augment that with M&A to continually drive the earnings growth. And so I don't think that we're just sitting here trying to collect the relatively small amount of interest income we can get on this cash balance. That's certainly not our goal. So we hear what you're saying. It's definitely something we're paying a lot of attention to internally. It's definitely something that the Board pays a lot of attention to when we meet with them. And I think overtime you'll be quite happy with the end result of where we're headed. Joseph Blair Werner - Peter B. Cannell & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, thank you. Operator : And this question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, guys, thanks for letting me ask a follow up. Dave, just relative to that consumer mix, I think there have been a lot of questions about the gross margin impact, I'd be kind of curious relative to the op-margin impact. How do we think about kind of the OpEx around this consumer opportunities that tend to be fairly significant unit-volume opportunities where you're kind of leveraging core IP that you've developed in other areas? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I mean, I think we'll see in the future as to how the consumer business grows and how fast that can grow, but I think it's safe to assume that if consumer is growing at a reasonable clip, that we'll get very good leverage on that and very good fall through to the bottom line. And that will be accretive to our operating margins number. There's no question that that's the model. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then Dave if I can sneak a quick one in, on the step-up of $5 million on deferred because of Hittite, is that now the full impact of Hittite? Or should we expect to see more in the July quarter going forward? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : No, I think that we got all of the inventory generally in the places we want with distribution or with our distributor partners with regards to Hittite products, so I think we're going to see the deferred margin number kind of ebb and flow with how the distributors themselves are managing their inventory and how their point of sales are going. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thanks again, guys. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : This question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, I just had a follow up on your consumer/medical business. I mean, right now your medical revenue is embedded in industrial, but if you look some of your consumer opportunities there seem to be like a convergence between medical and consumer. So I'm just wondering as we sort of go down the road the next couple of years, how are you going to be reporting this to the Street, given the convergence that is currently happening? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, just to be clear, we internally look at the healthcare business in total. And that's how it's managed internally, which is the way Vince was describing it. But when a product is targeted to a consumer customer, we already classify it as a consumer product, and so it is in the consumer category today. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, so even though eventually it's healthcare-related, if it sold in the hospital, it's medical, if it's sold to consumer, it's consumer? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Or better describe it as if it's sold to a hospital, it's counted in our industrial business. Well, it wouldn't be to a hospital, but to a customer that supplies to the hospital. Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : It's in our industry business. And if it's supplied to a consumer products company, it's a consumer, a piece of consumer rather. Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank for that clarification. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : This question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Earlier, you provided some good color around the distribution channel and inventories, and also orders. I was wondering about the other half of sales to your direct customers, and in particular can you remind us what products or end markets are mainly represented in your direct sales? And also any color on order trends, as well as inventory levels at direct customers. That would be great. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, we have all, or we have OEM customers in all of our end markets. I would say that a disproportionate amount of our distributor revenue is sold into the industrial market, and a disproportionate of our OEM revenue is sold into the consumer communications and auto markets. And what was the follow on question? I missed that part. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, the order trends coming into the current quarter versus last quarter? Pretty stable? Similar to the...? David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, yeah, sure. So I think we probably saw the weakest month in February, but as I said, I think that was pretty much as expected given the Lunar New Year. It kind of popped back up in March, it was a little bit better in April, and it's been pretty stable through at least May 19. So I would characterize the environment right now as pretty stable. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : This question comes from Deepon Nag with Macquarie. Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah, hi, guys. Talking about distribution inventory, so they came down pretty hard. Have you, first of all, was that primarily due to the European customers just not wanting to hold inventory? And have you seen them more willing to take on inventory now that currency has hopefully stabilized a bit? And incremental gross margins, should we still kind of think of 80% as the correct drop through? And can you guys talk about the puts and takes, especially as Hittite starts moving their products internally? Thanks a lot. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, so I wouldn't read too much into the fact that inventory came down this quarter, because I think that generally happens this quarter. It's usually a very strong POS quarter, or ship-out quarter for distributors. And so we generally do see inventory roll off a little bit. I don't think it had anything to do really with currency. And it wasn't specific to any one geography, it was pretty much they all came down pretty much at the same rate. On the gross margin front, the fall through, it generally is 80% obviously. If you do the math for the third quarter, that wouldn't be the case, mainly because we're bringing utilization down a little bit in the mix impacts. But I think generally, that's rule of thumb that's probably in the range of what we would expect gross margin to follow through as long as the growth rate is pretty balanced across all of the end markets. And so, the products manufactured internally, you know, get as much of a lift as the ones that are manufactured externally. Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, thanks a lot. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Bill C. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson calling in for Harlan, thanks for letting me sneak one in. I guess, thinking about the auto segment, and since the pipeline tends \u2013 you have some visibility, I think, for next year's model, things like that. Where do you see the relative growth? I believe you said safety would relatively outperform, but how would you rank rate safety, infotainment, and powertrain for the coming years, in terms of growth potential? Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, probably, we've three primary applications : we have infotainment, safety, and powertrain. So I would say in terms of relative growth, probably safety and powertrain will lead and we'll have good growth in infotainment, but I think a lot of the growth should be driven by safety and powertrain. Bill C. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Ali Husain - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you very much. It looks like that was our last question. So thanks for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking to you on our next quarter's earnings call which is scheduled for August 18, 2015. So, with all that, good night everyone.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Ali Husain : Thank you, Jennifer, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. You can find our press release and relating financial schedules on our Investor page at investor.analog.com.  Now before we begin, I want to call your attention to 2 new items. Number one is about a change around the timing of our future earnings conference calls, and number two is about increasing the level of information we provide investors. So first, starting next quarter, which will be our fiscal fourth quarter, we are going to move our earnings conference call to the morning. After speaking with many investors and analysts, we believe a morning call is a more convenient time for all stakeholders. As a result of this change, starting November 24, 2015, which is our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, and for every quarterly earnings conference call thereafter, we will issue our earnings release at 8 a.m. Eastern Time. And the earnings conference call will take place 2 hours later at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. Secondly, we have introduced an investor slide deck, which we call the investor toolkit. And this slide deck or toolkit has been designed to provide investors with even more clarity around our results. We've posted the toolkit on our Investor page at investor.analog.com, and this is something we plan to prepare and post every quarter through our website. So let's get back to today's call. As usual, I'm joined by ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. Our agenda for today's call will be as follows : First, I will provide a brief overview of our third quarter results, then Dave will review our financial performance in the third quarter and provide our business outlook for the fourth quarter. And finally, Vince will capstone the scripted portion of today's call with his closing remarks.  Now as is customary, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. So please note the information we're about to discuss today, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which we've posted on our IR page at investor.analog.com. So with all that behind us, let's get started. So as you've likely seen from our press release, ADI had another very strong performance in the third quarter of 2015. The combined power of our franchise, our commitment to innovation, the diversity of our business and our continued strong execution delivered results that were at the very high end of our guidance range. Revenue in the third quarter of $863 million increased 5% sequentially, and 19% year-over-year, once again, establishing a new high watermark for ADI. By end market, the industrial and automotive sectors were about in line with our expectations, while consumer revenue exceeded our plan and more than offset the impact from a weak wireless infrastructure CapEx environment. Now I would like to give you some color on our performance by end market during the third quarter. At 44% of total sales, our highly diversified industrial business was about even to the prior quarter. Strength within industrial verticals, such as aerospace and defense, and the renewable energy sector, was offset by weaker industrial automation sales. End customer bookings in the industrial market were generally stable during the quarter. We believe that there's currently a good match between supply and demand in our industrial business, which is largely serviced through distribution, where we recognize revenue in all regions of the world on a sell-through basis. Now turning to automotive. After growing 13% sequentially in the second quarter, automotive decreased 7% in the seasonally slower third quarter and represented 15% of our total sales. At the current quarterly run rate, automotive represents a $500 million-plus annual business for Analog Devices.  Revenue from our hundreds of communications infrastructure customers at 16% of sales declined 22% sequentially, which was the third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue declines in the sector. Revenue from wireline customers represented about 1/3 of our communications infrastructure sales, and was approximately flat to the prior quarter. A weaker-than-planned wireless infrastructure market in North America and China, combined with customer inventory drawdowns, impacted our performance in the third quarter. We believe that current wireless infrastructure revenue run rates for ADI are artificially low, and that our strong position in this sector will allow us to recover rapidly when this market snaps back, as it usually does without much notice. Consumer revenues at 24% of sales grew significantly over the prior quarter. While prosumer audio/video was stable sequentially, portable applications continue to drive our consumer growth. Our strategy in consumer remains strikingly consistent : we participate in those applications where we can leverage existing core technology to solve our customers' toughest challenges, where we believe our innovation is sustainable and where our technology makes a meaningful difference to the user experience. And by leveraging existing core technology, we further increase the ROI on our R&D investment. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the third quarter. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Dave's comments on third quarter 2015 P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate total $30 million. When comparing our third quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter results and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release. So with that, Dave, it's all yours. David Zinsner : Thanks, Ali, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter of 2015 turned out to be another strong quarter for ADI, with revenue increasing to a record $863 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.77, both at the high end of the range. Gross margin in the third quarter of 66.1% was down 40 basis points from the prior quarter and was well within our gross margin model range of 65% to 68%. Factory utilization in the third quarter was about even to the prior quarter. Inventory on a days basis in the third quarter increased by 1 day to 128 days and on a dollars basis increased by $30 million, primarily related to the positioning of inventory for higher expected consumer revenue in the fourth quarter. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors on a dollars basis increased by 6% from the prior quarter, and distributor inventory on a weeks basis was at 7.5 weeks, which is within our model range and consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expenses in the third quarter increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 5% sequential increase in revenue, as we continue to manage operating costs very tightly, allowing us to gain more operating leverage in our model. As a percent of sales, operating expenses in the third quarter declined 90 basis points compared to the prior quarter and declined 210 basis points compared to the same period a year ago.  Operating profit as a percent of sales has been on a steady march upward, starting in the first quarter of 2014 when it was 29% of sales. In the just completed quarter, operating profit was approximately 500 basis points higher at 34.2% of sales, increasing sequentially and year-over-year and well within our operating model range of 32% to 36% of revenue. Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $6 million. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter.  Our third quarter tax rate was approximately 15%, which is also the rate we expect in the fourth quarter. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share of $0.77 increased by 5% over the prior quarter and 22% year-over-year and was at the high end of our guidance range. At the end of the third quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.1 billion, with approximately $700 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2.2 billion. During the third quarter, capital expenditures were $35 million. Our capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2015 is to be between $155 million and $160 million. Our financial model generates strong cash flows, and we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders. For the trailing 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $822 million or 25% of sales and returned $784 million or 95% of that free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock, and that will be paid on September 9 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 28. So in summary, the third quarter was another very successful quarter for Analog Devices. So now I'll turn to our fourth quarter outlook, which with the exception of revenue, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today's call and release.  While order trends in the industrial market are stable, we are entering the seasonally slower fourth quarter for our industrial business, and as a result, expect this sector to decline somewhat from the third quarter levels. In automotive and communications infrastructure, order rates are also stable, and we therefore expect these markets to remain about even to the third quarter levels. In consumer, we expect to benefit from strong seasonal and cyclical trends, leading us to plan for continued strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. So in total, we're planning for revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $880 million to $940 million, which represents an increase of approximately 2% to 9% sequentially. At the midpoint of this range, revenue of $910 million would present an -- would represent an increase of 12% year-over-year. We expect gross margins in the fourth quarter to be approximately 65.5%, given the likely mix of business. We are anticipating operating expenses in the fourth quarter to increase between 1% and 3% sequentially, lagging our expected sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. One line item that we expect to exclude from our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses is a special charge of approximately $220 million associated with the conversion of our Irish-defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan. This conversion will give people employed by ADI's operations in Ireland more ownership in their own retirement assets and will benefit the company by eliminating a growing long-term liability, while reducing expense volatility that is typically associated with these defined benefits plans.  Based on these estimates, and excluding this and other special items, diluted earnings per share is anticipated to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.87 in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of this range, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 20% year-over-year, which would be a great result relative to our EPS model of 8% to 15% growth. So now I'll turn the call over to Vince for closing remarks. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everybody. As we've talked about in today's remarks, the third quarter was another excellent quarter for ADI, reflecting the combined power of our strong execution and our balanced approach to growth, profitability and shareholder returns. At ADI, we continue to focus on superior and sustainable innovation, and we leverage our investment across diverse applications and customers. Today, ADI's 20,000-strong product offerings are in thousands of applications at over 100,000 customers, helping them sense, measure, interpret and connect the physical world. It is quite true to say that wherever the toughest signal processing challenges lie, be they on a factory floor or indeed at the outer edge of our solar system, customers are increasingly relying on ADI's product and applications know-how to help navigate the new intersection between the physical and the digital worlds. Just this past quarter, for example, ADI's mixed signal processing capability was onboard the New Horizons Deep Space probe, providing critical measurement and conversion capability to the spacecraft as it navigated past the surface of Pluto. In industrial applications, we see factory automation and control, or as some call it, industrial IoT, as the next driver of industrial revitalization. Other industrial applications that fall within this umbrella include Smart Agriculture and Smart Cities. All these applications leverage our current product offerings, as we help our customers carve out new ways of using our technology, and in many ways helping them unlock new sources of value in this emerging industrial IoT. One of the areas that most excites me about the impact of our innovation is in health care, where we have been investing for some time now. Here, our focus is on critical care imaging applications and clinical grade vital signs monitoring. Today, ADI is working with several of the world's leading research institutions and systems OEMs to drive game-changing advancement in the performance, impact and affordability of medical electronic devices, helping shift health care delivery to point of care and greatly improving the lives of countless patients.  In automotive, active, predictive and passive safety systems, precision powertrain control systems and high-quality multimedia systems require a proliferation of sensors and actuators, which in turn place ever-increasing demands on signal processing technologies as do government mandates. These are an excellent match for our offerings. In addition, while we continue to have a strong position with U.S. and European manufacturers, we still have opportunity ahead as we increasingly serve the Asian market.  The near-term volatility in communications infrastructure gives us no pause about the long-term upward trend in this market. The facts are that 4G penetration is low, data consumption is increasing exponentially and radio density is also increasing. But in order for carriers to continue densifying their networks, our customers must solve the significant challenges associated with making the most efficient and flexible use of available spectrum, while at the same time reducing power and systems cost. ADI's software-defined radio and transceiver technologies help solve these very tough challenges, while also delivering a lower total cost of ownership to our customers, and in the process, driving growth for ADI. In wireline infrastructure, we focus primarily around the timing and control of the signal path and optical communication systems, where the engineering challenge requires very high-performance timing and precision processing. The move from 10G and 40G to 100G systems to satisfy burgeoning data demand further creates strong growth opportunities for ADI. Overall, our mixed signal RF and microwave technologies are in increasing demand from many thousands of customers, and we are continuing to invest aggressively to capture the growing opportunity available to us.  So in summary, we remain committed to growing our revenues at 2x to 3x GDP, to grow diluted earnings per share by 8% to 15% annually and achieve our EPS goal of $4 to $5 by 2020. Finally, let me end by saying that the uncertainty in the macro environment is not new to any of us. At ADI, we take a long-term view, and we believe that innovation is the cornerstone of business success. While we manage our investments conservatively, we execute our strategy aggressively.  So we are confident that our ethos of innovation, our leadership in signal processing and our alignment to favorable macro trends will allow us to outperform and continue delivering strong returns to our shareholders. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Vince. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We're going to run the call until 6 p.m. [Operator Instructions] So with that operator, let's start the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher Danely : Just a question on the, I guess, the consumer end market. Obviously, some pretty strong performance this quarter and the previous quarter. For the January quarter, do you think consumer can continue to increase and what would be the factors there? David Zinsner : Good question, Chris. Typically, the first quarter for consumer is seasonally down. So I think we would expect year-over-year, it would be up. But my guess is sequentially, it will be down, because that's typically what happens seasonally in that business, as the kind of Christmas season gets behind us. Christopher Danely : Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain : No. Re-queue. Christopher Danely : All right. If you don't ask, you don't get it. Ali Husain : Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Ali here. I think this is a good opportunity to remind folks on the line here about the ADI story, and why we believe ADI offers investors what we believe is a pretty unique combination and a fairly balanced approach to all 3 things : revenue growth, operating leverage and shareholder return. So in terms of revenue growth, we believe we're tied to the right end markets, with the right technologies and products. For example, about 2/3 of our sales are from industrial and automotive, and over 2/3 of our sales are from products and technologies where we, in fact, lead the market. So we believe that forms a pretty good, wide sustainable moat around our business. Number two in terms of operating leverage, as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've marched those op margins up about 500 basis points over the last several quarters, and we still have about 200 basis points of operating margin leverage remaining in our model. And lastly, in terms of shareholder returns, as you all know, we've committed to returning 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. We also have a target to increase our EPS by 8% to 15% annually. We have an EPS target of $4 to $5 per share, which when you look at the trailing 12-month number here, we've been kind of in the $2.80 ZIP Code, so we believe that $4 to $5 EPS target is a meaningful one for investors. So all said, we believe we've got a pretty good balance of revenue growth, leverage and shareholder returns going. So thanks for the question, Chris. Feel free to re-queue and we'll get to our next question. Thanks. Operator : And this question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : I guess. Dave, I want to get a little bit to the margin profile on the consumer business, both on the gross and the operating line. I'm assuming that all of the gross margin decline in the October quarter is because of the increase in consumer. I'm just wondering, it seems like consumer is up a lot in October, but not up as much as July, but the impact to gross margin sequentially is about the same. I'm just wondering if there's anything going on within consumer mix. And I guess, more importantly, how do I think about operating margins in that consumer business? Because clearly there's not as much SG&A expense to that incremental revenue. So is it sort of diluted to kind of gross margins, but accretive to op margins? Is that the way I should think about it? David Zinsner : Well, there's a lots of puts and takes in both the second -- or the third and fourth quarter. Gross margins are a little bit dilutive in the consumer business, obviously, but it's relatively modest compared to the corporate average. But there are a whole lot of other businesses that are going up and down. And so collectively, I think mix was actually pretty flat for the third quarter. We think the fourth quarter, probably mix will impact it a little bit negatively. I think the gross margins really were down in the third quarter mostly as a result of inventory reserves we took against some last time builds related to Hittite, as we transitioned some of the production away from one foundry and into another foundry. The old parts we took a reserve on for the levels that were beyond, I think, about a year. On the operating margin side, the consumer -- incremental consumer business is accretive. That's why we saw gross margin expansion this quarter. That's why we think midpoint of our guidance we'll see gross -- or operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter as well. So it's obviously, as we're leveraging a lot of the existing technology that we've invested over the course of, at least, a decade probably to be able to serve the consumer business. And so as a result, the ongoing R&D expense isn't terribly significant. Operator : This question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : The question is a follow-up to the 2 earlier, with regards to the consumer segment. Can you speak to the degree to which you're seeing application and customer breadth with the platform technology that's favorably impacting the third and fourth quarters' results? And from here, what's the opportunity to grow customers and application exposure as you look out to fiscal '16? David Zinsner : Well, precision technology, we're attempting to leverage that across all of our end markets and all of our customers. The specific product is -- that is driving some of the demand for next quarter is specific to one customer. And in a lot of cases, we work with those customers to customize the technology for their needs. And obviously, as we do that, we don't give that to another customer to be able to utilize. So I don't know if this answers your question, Craig, but our fundamental tenet is to take our technology and leverage it to as many customers as we possibly can and as many end markets as we possibly can. Vincent Roche : Yes, Craig. We have a 40-year plus heritage of developing silicon -- precision silicon, high-speed silicon, but the precision silicon is -- the industrial market is largely about control-type applications, which is precision-oriented. So that's the primary market for that technology. And as we -- you get different markets driving technology at different rates, and you get a ping-pong between one market and another. So there's good leverage from the industrial-type applications into consumer for that technology but also vice versa. So many, many thousands of customers. And we have -- it's -- the business there is largely about thousand -- many thousands of customers, many thousands of products. But in some cases, we customize products for markets and, indeed, customers. So it's a very, very complex diversified space. Operator : This question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus. Tore Svanberg : I would ask a nonconsumer question. So some of your peers have talked about a slowdown here the last couple months in order rates, especially in the industrial market. I'm just wondering what you're seeing. I do realize you're guiding for the industrial business to be fairly flat this quarter. But just from a macro level, what are you seeing on your order rates? David Zinsner : I would say, so in general, our order rates were pretty stable. They were stronger, obviously, in the consumer business. They were a little softer in the industrial business. But not atypical for this period of time, given that July and August are months in which a lot of industrial customers take the opportunity to shut down their production for some period of time. And so we normally see a little bit of a softer patch in terms of order levels. But it was very typical relative to other third quarters. So we didn't really see anything anomalous in the order patterns that would suggest there's macro weakness out there or anything like that. Ali Husain : And the only thing I'd add to that, Tore, is when you look at generally some of the outlooks provided by some of the large distributors out there for their components business, they're generally operating in some level of some seasonal range. They may be operating at the lower end of that seasonal range. But I think for folks like ADI, where we don't have a lot of PC exposure, in fact, our PC exposure is probably 0. And we're leveraged in the kinds of markets, particularly in the industrial space, for example, that do play, I guess, in the -- I guess, fairly closely, I guess, to what some of the distributors are also exposed to, number one. Number two, our revenue recognition policy is extremely conservative. We only recognize revenue when distributors sell-through, so we believe we're probably a little closer to end demand than maybe some of the other folks out there. So, and then lastly, our weeks of inventory in the channel are still at sort of 7, 7.5 weeks. So our sense of it is that we're operating in some kind of a seasonal range here. The bottom hasn't dropped off, I'd say, as maybe some of the competitors out there have maybe spoken about. But I think generally our sense is that what we're seeing is generally in line with probably what you've heard from some of the others distributors out there. Operator : This question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial. Christopher Caso : Just a follow-up question with regard to the automotive market, and that was also a market that looked like it was a bit weaker than perhaps you had planned coming into the quarter. Would you consider the order rates there also to be stable? Obviously, there's a lot of macro concerns in there. What are your customers telling you with regard to that market? David Zinsner : Yes, at this point, that business is stable. I mean, the third quarter is generally a softer quarter, again, for, the automotive space. Again, it's for the same reasons that the industrial business is generally seeing some weakness in the summer months, automotive guys tend to take some production downtime, particularly in July. It was kind of on the lower end of our normalized range that we would have expected. So it wasn't out of the norm, maybe just a little bit weaker. And of course, this is always tough to call with any form of certainty. But the order rates were stable in auto. My guess is they will be at least flat in terms of shipment next quarter, if not a little bit better. And so I think that business is behaving as we would expect. Operator : And this question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : It's related to the automotive space. When we look at the growth so far this year, it's sort of been flattish. And the question is, is this just tied to some specific customer patterns? Or is it just lumpiness? Or do you think some other consolidation or M&A might be required to get the growth rates up to what a lot of the peers are reporting? David Zinsner : I mean, I think we have a really good pipeline of opportunities in that business. And Vince and I have spent the last several weeks really kind of going through their pipeline with them. And we're excited about really in every subsegment within automotive and infotainment and in safety, in powertrain, the opportunities we see out there in the future for automotive. Every so often, you get a year where, because of the way the models kind of roll out and the timing of where our products get designed into those customers, sometimes you get a year that is a little softer. And that's made up, usually, by another year where things are very strong. One year I think we grew 25% year-over-year. Another year, I think, we grew 4%. So this is pretty much in the norm. Our goal is to grow this business kind of high singles, maybe even to the double-digit range over time. And we'll have certain years that do better than others. But if you look at the pipeline, we think we've got the opportunities to allow us to drive good growth in that business. Operator : This question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Can you go into a little more detail on what's going on in the comms side? We know that China was weak for others, and you split out the wireline versus the wireless side. But the confidence you have that you're under-shipping demand? And any sort of guess as to when that might snap back? David Zinsner : I think communications, as you know, has seen some weakness, particularly in China, given what we think is kind of a stoppage of rollout of macro base stations, while they do some investigations. We think we've kind of reached the bottom of what we might experience, and that it's unlikely to get any lower from here in the wireless space. But it's anybody's guess as to when that kind of resumes. We have gotten -- and Vince can probably add more color to this, we have gotten input from our OEM customers that it will resume. And it's really just a question of when at this point. I don't know if you have anything to add there. Vincent Roche : Yes, I think Dave is right. At least, the demand from the OEMs on the ADI is stable. And as Dave said, I believe we've hit the bottom. So I think we're -- let's say, we're primed and ready to go in terms of supply line when the demand kicks back, which I believe will be much sooner than later here. Ali Husain : Thanks, Ross. And the only thing I'd add to that is the bookings are -- as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the bookings are stable, which is always a good sign of this business. And we did go back and look to see when the last time we were at these kind of revenue levels in the comms infrastructure space. And it's been a long time. So it's very, very low. And our sense is that things are, at least, stable here. And if you can call the recovery on it, let me know. But it's always harder for us to do it. Operator : This question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Dave, I was just curious, you came at the high end of the range, but the other segments were weak. So consumer is up even more. To the extent you can talk about it, I know it's hard, what drove that upside? Was it more timing, maybe the ramp happened earlier or was it just the sheer volume? And then as you look to October, it's a wider range than usual, particularly given it looks like it's mostly consumer. Can you talk about what the puts and takes there are as well? Is there other products? Or is it just you're being -- taking a more conservative angle on the ramp? Any help there. David Zinsner : Yes, sure. Thanks, Blayne. So the third quarter did come in within the range, clearly it was at the high end of the range. So we did have a scenario in which we were going to get to this level, it doesn't come as a complete surprise. I would say that, that was our kind of best-case scenario. And that actually played out. And obviously, that had a lot to do with the consumer business and the fact that these ramps can be dynamic in terms of how the production gets rolled out. And you get input from the customers, but that is changing week-to-week, and you never know really how you're going to -- how are things are going to progress. And so we take a couple of different scenarios that might occur, and it just so happens that this one ended up being a more positive outcome. We, again, do that for the fourth quarter, and that is why we have a wider range. There's obviously a scenario in which the production ramps fast and stays stable within the quarter. There's a scenario, obviously, in which it ramps up, but then they get to their inventory levels that they need and things pause for a little bit. So we hope that we've been conservative enough in our forecast to make sure that we stay within this range. And I think we have tortured this quite a bit, as you might imagine, and we feel pretty confident that we've got the right range in there. Operator : This question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : Just a question on the overall business mix. What is the right way to think about longer term the business would look like? Clearly, consumer is doing great for you. But as you all know, the investor base is also attracted to the balanced -- Ali, as you were pointing out, to the balanced business model. No real concentration to a customer. So longer term, what's the right way to think about -- what is the mix that will make you folks feel comfortable, okay, this is kind of how the business should look like? Vincent Roche : Well, the strategy is playing out as we've designed it. We have, let's say, over the last 5 or 6 years, been steering more and more of our R&D towards what we consider to be business-to-business application like industrial, health care, automotive and communications infrastructure. That's where the lion's share of our R&D is placed, and that's where the lion's share of our sales force works as well, to ensure that we cover -- that we grab the opportunity by covering the broadest base of customers and applications that we can. We've always said in the consumer area that we have a very, very targeted, focused play in terms of R&D and customer engagement. And that we play only in spaces where technology makes a huge difference to the user experience and where the technology, we believe, is sustainable over time. So clearly, the consumer markets are more volatile than, let's say, the B2B markets. But we've got a good blend, I think, as a company in terms of being able to invest in the areas that give us the longer product life cycles, the more sustainable businesses. And I think a good bet and a very sustainable investment in the consumer space. So over time, as demand moves between one sector or the other, B2B versus consumer, so will go the fortunes of the business. But I think overall, what you got to look at is the commitment that we've got to delivering 2x to 3x GDP, gross margins in the 65% to 68% range, and getting our EPS well above $4. So that's what -- that's our goal, that's our mission, and that's what we're delivering. Operator : This question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie : I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about China. And specifically, can you talk about if industrial orders for China were any different from other regions? And as you look more longer term, obviously, there's been a lot of talk in the news about does China's shift to a different economy? Where they're not just the manufacturing hub of the world and investing more in the service economy, et cetera. So does that suggest to you that maybe there's some lower opportunity for industrial growth for you guys into the future? Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a very good question. So clearly, as you said, China is shifting from we make it to we design it and build it. So we've benefited. This will be actually, when history's written on our fiscal '15 here, we will have had -- we'll have posted very, very strong double-digit growth in the industrial sector in China across the board, in fact, in health care, in energy, transmission and distribution of energy in particular, and also industrial instrumentation and automation. So clearly, China is in the process of indigeni-zating -- indigenizing the tech industry there. So we're benefiting from that in terms of our engagements with emerging OEMs in way outside of the consumer, the communications infrastructure and consumer businesses. So industrial's emerging, automotive's emerging, health care's emerging, and we're doing particularly well. I'm pleased with the progress we're making in building out our business there. J. Steven Smigie : Great. And the part about the short-term on China versus other regions in industrial? Vincent Roche : It's been very, very -- it's been quite strong and it remains steady. Operator : This question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah : Vince, ADI has this history of being in and out of the consumer market. And if I look at the October quarter, it looked like consumer will be roughly 30% of sales. And my guess is that portable will account for a substantial portion of that. So my question is what's your confidence or visibility into sustaining your position here in this high-volume program? Vincent Roche : Well, we have, in the past, I think in many cases, we have -- at one point in time, about 5 or 6 years ago, we were spending about 35% or 40% of the entire R&D budget of the company in many, many different applications within consumer. I think the way to think about this time, the spend is quite constrained. It is in an area that is very, very close to the core capability of the company, and we're playing with market leaders. We're playing with the leaders and defining really exciting opportunities together that we think have really got legs over the long term. So it's a very focused engagement. And we are really concentrating on uncovering those problems that give us the opportunity to apply the best of our technology over the long term. I think that's how to think about it. Romit Shah : I guess my question is, how do you manage the risk associated with mix, given that consumer is now a larger percentage of sales than, I think, we've seen in the last 5, 10 years? Vincent Roche : Well, the foundation of this company is the business-to-business space, it's the communications infrastructure, it's the industrial business, automotive, health care where we have many, many thousands of customers, hundreds and hundreds of applications, 20,000 product SKUs. And the R&D is largely pointed there. So that is the core business of ADI and will remain so into the future. So in terms of how -- I'm telling you how we're strategically viewing it. How demand patterns evolve over time will depend on macro markets, will depend on the success of our technology and so on and so forth. But I think we've got the right strategic mix here. And the rest is down to how well we execute in the markets. Operator : This question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Do you think your book -- what would your book-to-bill be if you took out the consumer ramp? I know you said it's positive right now. What would it be if you took the consumer ramp for next quarter out? David Zinsner : I think it's, yes, roughly 1. Stacy Rasgon : Roughly 1? Even with industrial falling and automotive -- I know you said it was sort of in line, but it was supposed to be flat, it was down 7? David Zinsner : Yes. Operator : This question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Just a question on Hittite. Just a couple quarters in now, just how the integration is going. And then just bigger picture as you think about capital allocation and your appetite for M&A versus buybacks and dividends. David Zinsner : Okay, well, the Hittite integration is going fantastic. The business has done great, and we are exactly on plan in terms of our synergies. And really I'd be interested to hear Vince's take, but I would say, it's almost as if that whole prior Hittite aspect of the company has completely gone away. They're part of the ADI family. They operate -- in a lot of ways you can't tell the ADI employees from the Hittite employees in the RF space -- or RF part of our business. So it's been a tremendous success. Our intended use of capital does include acquisitions going forward. And we continue to look at different opportunities in that space. As you know, we're looking for technology that is highly differentiated, that's really synergistic with what we're doing with our customers, where our customers will see value in us having that capability, or where we think that will integrate with some of the things we do in a way that just kind of elegantly provides a solution to the customer. And so we continually monitor what opportunities are out there. I wouldn't guarantee that we're going to do an acquisition in the next year, but I think it's a reasonable probability that there will be some tuck-in kind of opportunity for us over the next year that could be just as dynamic as Hittite was for the ADI business. Vincent Roche : Yes, I think just to add a little bit of color to what Dave has said. In terms of Hittite, I mean, we were always very, very confident in the technology, the market position of Hittite. So really, if there was a risk, it was going to be around the cultural integration of the 2 entities. So we share very similar -- we knew that the value system at Hittite was very, very similar to ADI's in terms of the belief that innovation drives business success, that engineering excellence is really what matters in that business to customers. And that's exactly how it's played out. And I think when you watch, as I do, the interaction of our engineering teams with our biggest customers out there and across the board in many, many different applications, not just in communications, but the leveraging of that technology into areas like aerospace and defense, instrumentation, satellite communication, it's really tremendous. So I have enormous optimism and confidence about the combination of the RF and microwave talent across the entire company and what it means to future growth prospects of ADI. So great, delighted with it. Operator : This question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : I'm wondering if you can dig a little bit more into the wireless part of the business. Understanding that we're seeing a pause in China, and the business is down quite a bit from its prior peak, I'm wondering what gives you confidence that we're at the bottom and that you see a snapback in relatively short order? David Zinsner : Well, I think it's 2 reasons. One, the order rates have stabilized over a fairly long period of time. And usually, when things are weakening, you see it in the order rates pretty quickly. And then the other thing is Vince and some of the business unit leaders, they are regularly going out to the larger OEMs that supply into this space, our customers, to get a pulse of what's going on. And the feedback from those customers is that they have obviously reduced their order flow to us, to this level for reasons that we're all well aware of. But their expectation is that they are going to turn those order levels back up at some point within the next couple of quarters. So we don't know exactly when that'll happen. It could happen in the late part of next quarter, it could be first quarter before it happens. But given that the OEMs are telegraphing that to us, that gives us some confidence that we're at the bottom. And that in all likelihood, we'll see it turn back up at some point here. Operator : This question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess, a question on your free cash flow conversion numbers. It was around 19% this quarter as a percent of sales. Last 4 quarters, it has been around is 25%, I think. What do you think it takes to get within your target of 28% to 32%? And as consumer gets bigger, does that have any impact to your free cash flow generation as you go forward? David Zinsner : Well, that's a good question. I think really when you look at this quarter, because of the ramp in the consumer business, that requires us to lay out a fair amount of cash to our foundries to build up the inventory to be able to support that demand. And so our working capital number, I think if you looked at it relative to the past several quarters, you'll see it's actually quite a bit more negative than in most quarters. I think that's part of it. We were in the trailing edges of spending a bit on building infrastructures. That's mostly behind us now, and so I think that starts to improve. And then lastly, we pay our variable compensation every other quarter. It just so happened to be this quarter, we paid out 0.5 year's worth of variable compensation, and so that hit us as well. So this was like the perfect storm of all the things kind of going against us on a free cash flow basis. But we analyze this quite a bit, particularly recently, given that the number was a little bit below our benchmark. And we feel pretty confident that we will be within that range in relatively short order, once we kind of get to a normalized state in terms of working capital in particular related to the consumer business. Operator : This question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Christopher Muse : I guess, curious in terms of the macro demand picture and whether or not you're seeing any softness geographically. So that, I guess, primarily a question around auto, industrial, and what you can share there cycle-wise and demand-wise. And then, I guess, if I could sneak a second one in, did you have a 10% customer in the quarter? David Zinsner : Do you want to take the geographic question? Vincent Roche : Yes, let me talk about the geo thing a little bit. So I think, overall, just to give you a little bit of color there. So Europe I would say, not surprisingly, the industrial sector is a little weak. Europe tends to take a pause. And I'd say the industrial sector in particular was maybe a little weaker than we had expected. So I think as well, North America in industrial was also relatively weak. Some sectors were better than others. And I think when you look at China and Asia Pacific, automotive was quite soft, and it's well publicized that the communications infrastructure was weak, but at least the patterns have stabilized there. David Zinsner : And then in response to the 10% customer, we did have one customer for the quarter that was greater than 10%. Operator : This question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing : How close to full factory utilization are you in the October quarter? And with the consumer mix, has your view changed on managing factory utilizations and internal inventory throughout the year? Is it possible to get kind of steadier utilization throughout a normal year? David Zinsner : We were in the mid-70s for utilization this quarter. That was similar to where we were last quarter. I don't remember if I said it before, but we are probably going to take utilization down a little bit in the fourth quarter. All of the ramp in revenue for the fourth quarter, at least on a front end -- from a front-end perspective, will come from foundries. So it won't affect utilization in any way on the front end. Now ideally, over time, we're working to get that utilization up. And it has been -- I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it has been steadily kind of moving up a little bit, and it has been helpful to gross margin. So that is our goal to make better use of our existing factories to drive gross margin expansion. Operator : This question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello : Kind of a philosophical question. Going forward, I wondered what your approach will be. For folks who have won a lot of consumer business or ramped a lot of consumer business, in particular with one big customer over time, some of your analog peers, someone like a Linear, when that product comes up for invariable price declines or ASP declines, some analog companies have kind of walked away from that business like Linear. Others like NXP, have said, \"Look, as long as we're maximizing gross profit dollars, we don't care if it hurts our gross margin a little bit.\" Either obvious -- obviously either approach is fine. Both companies have been incredibly successful with those different approaches, but I wonder what your philosophy will be on that as we go forward. David Zinsner : Well, our goal is we won this business, our goal is to keep it. And the good news is we think it's technology that has a lot of legs to it, that is highly differentiated. And as a result, the customer values it and pays a premium for it. So we're not -- our anticipation is that we will not lose it, nor will we have massive ASP erosion as a result. But that will be borne out over time. Vincent Roche : Yes, look, I think another aspect of the strategy here is that a lot of technology trends center around these types of consumer systems being able to see, being able to hear, being able to feel. And I think there is some great macro trends there that speak very well to the types of technology that we have, the -- sort of the intersection of the physical world and the world of the digital. So, and as the performance goes up, the space is getting tighter and tighter. Battery power efficiency has got to become greater and greater. There are some really chunky problems to be solved there. So, and not just one type of problem. There's many, many different problems. So we seek -- as we do across all our businesses, we look for diversity in each application in terms of the types of technology that we can apply, the number of products that we can develop. And so it's not a tale of 1 product, 1 customer. It's a tale of many, many different types of technologies across many, many different modalities there in terms of that intersection of the physical and digital worlds. Operator : This question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Just coming back to the seasonality part of the business. So with consumer being about 30% in the next quarter, how should we think about not just the January quarter, but maybe even the April quarter. So you had some seasonality in the past. I'm just trying to figure out how that's going to play out going forward. David Zinsner : Well, Tore, you're asking me to whip out the crystal ball here, which, I don't know, might be on the fritz. I would say that sitting here today with almost no backlog to really tell for certain how things are going to progress, that the first quarter, which is typically down mid-single digits, given that there's -- a more significant percentage is likely to be in the consumer space in the fourth quarter, and that, that has normally a more dramatic seasonal decline in the first quarter. We're likely to be more than mid-single digits down sequentially in the first quarter. But I'm not certain of that. And then in the second quarter, generally, consumer seasonally is relatively flat first quarter to second quarter. But we have this lift in industrial that tends to be our best quarter for industrial in the second quarter, and that gives us a good lift for the second quarter, sequentially. And so that is how I would model it out right now, having limited information as to how things kind of behave. Operator : This question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Dave, just real quickly, when you look at the October run rate on the consumer side, does that now represent kind of your full opportunity on the mobile side, i.e. multiple platforms at a certain customer? Or -- and hence, from here, it's more of a unit story? Or there's actually potentially other platforms that you guys can penetrate within the consumer space? David Zinsner : I don't think I would suggest that the back half of the year we're going to have any specific additional platforms. But our goal over time is to expand in every end market in terms of opportunity. So over time, I think there is opportunity to do that. Operator : This question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Sorry to beat this dead horse about macro and seasonality. But is there something that is company specific outside of consumer that you think is helping you provide a more sort of stable/seasonal outlook, versus a more cautious outlook that we have heard from, say, a Linear Tech or a Microchip or a Texas Instruments? David Zinsner : Well, I do think that the industrial business for us is made up of these kind of broader market, end markets, and then these more ASSP-oriented markets. And I think it's safe to say that the broader markets were a bit weaker, and that the ASSP or vertical markets did a little bit better. That's -- I think in Vince's -- somewhere in Vince's remarks, he talked a lot about diversity. I think, also Ali's talked about it as well. I mean that's the benefit of diversity is we're in so many different parts of the industrial space, both the broad market and very interesting verticals. And some do better than others and depending on the quarter. But I think that really -- if I had to like line our performance up in the third quarter relative to what I saw from some of the other players, I would say where we outperformed seemed to be in some of the specific verticals like aerospace and defense and energy and so forth. Vincent Roche : As you know, we're on a sell-through basis across the globe as well, so the transparency that we have around demand and supply is very, very strong. So our sense is that there's a good balance between consumption and supply at this point in time. And we, as a company, measure only end customer bookings. So that's what we base our understanding of demand on. And so what we're reflecting to you is what we see. Ali Husain : All right. Great. Well, looks like we have reached the 6 :00 hour here. And we appreciate everybody dialing in. So listen, as a reminder, our 4Q '15 results are planned to be issued on November 24, 2015, at 8 a.m. Eastern Time and our conference call should begin 2 hours later at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. So thanks again everyone for joining us this evening. We look forward to speaking with you again on November 24 at 10 a.m. So good night.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Ali Husain : All right, great. Thanks, Jennifer, and it feels good to say good morning everyone. Thank you for joining ADI's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. You can find our press release and related financial schedules on our investor page at investor.analog.com. As usual, this morning, I'm joined by ADI's CEO, Vince Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. The agenda for this morning is as follows. First, we'll provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and fiscal '15 results, and then we'll provide our current thinking and our outlook for the first quarter of 2016, and finally, Vince will capstone the prepared remarks, following which we'll open up the lines for Q&A. So before we start, let's get through the important disclosures we have to make every quarter. Please note the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-K. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which we have posted on our IR page at investor.analog.com. So let's get started. As you've likely seen from the press release, ADI had another very strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $979 million, increasing 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. These results were above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to strength in Portable Consumer Devices, and to a lesser extent, from some recovery in the wireless communications infrastructure market. For our just completed fiscal 2015, revenue totaled $3.4 billion, with Industrial Applications representing the largest portion at $1.5 billion or 44% of sales. The balance of revenue for the year was about evenly distributed across Consumer, Communications and Automotive applications. So during the fourth quarter, continued strength in Consumer Portable Devices resulted in $317 million of Consumer revenue, which was a sequential increase of 53%. Here, our precision technology platforms are being leveraged to deliver highly innovative user experiences and are driving very strong ROI for ADI's R&D investments. Revenue from Communications Infrastructure customers represented 16% of revenue, an increase of 12% sequentially in the fourth quarter, which was ahead of expectations. Wireline applications decreased sequentially while the combination of inventory replenishment and improving wireless CapEx spend drove our strong wireless infrastructure sequential revenue performance, as customers continued to deploy our highly innovative micro AF and RF solutions. Now despite this near-term rebound, wireless base station deployments are well below prior peaks and I'd say the same is true for ADI's wireless infrastructure sales. During the fourth quarter, our broad and highly diversified industrial end market decreased 4% sequentially, which was in line with seasonal patterns. All of the industrial subsegments within the industrial business declined sequentially, with the exception of Aerospace and Defense, which was stable to the prior quarter.  And as you know, the industrial market is our most diverse customer base. It spans many different subsegments. It requires our highest performance technology, as you well know. It also supports very long life cycles and earns above corporate average gross margins. During the fourth quarter, our automotive business had 14% of sales, performed in line with expectations and was stable to the prior quarter. While near-term demand, we believe, is being impacted by lower-than-anticipated sales of premium vehicles in China, premium automotive suppliers continue to incorporate ADI's high performance technologies and applications such as radar-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and powertrain efficiency systems, which grew 33% and 10%, respectively, during the fiscal year '15. Automotive revenue for the year totaled $526 million, growing at a 9% revenue CAGR over the past 5 years, which is in fact 3x the rate of vehicle unit growth over this period. So in total, ADI's fiscal '15 revenue increased 20% from the prior year and totaled $3.4 billion. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and in fiscal '15. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Dave's comments in fourth quarter and fiscal '15 P&L line items, free cash flow and free cash flow margin will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $243 million for the quarter and $335 million, respectively, for the year. When comparing our fourth quarter and full year performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E and Schedule F in today's earnings release. So with that, Dave, I'll turn it over to you. David Zinsner : Thanks, Ali. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The fourth quarter was once again a very strong and profitable quarter for ADI, and we set records for quarterly revenue, earnings per share and cash flow generation. Revenue this quarter increased to a record $979 million, and diluted earnings per share was $1.03, with both results above the high end of our guidance. Gross margins this quarter were 65.7%, which was in line with our guidance, and down 40 basis points from the prior quarter primarily due to mix. Days of inventory in the fourth quarter decreased to 114 days from the prior quarters 128 days primarily on higher revenue. And dollars of inventory decreased $12 million over the prior quarter. Weeks of inventory and distribution were approximately 7.5 weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Total end customer orders decreased in the fourth quarter as compared to the third, which is quite typical in advance of a seasonally slow first quarter and our book-to-bill was below 1. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased 6% sequentially, lagging well behind the 13% sequential increase in revenue as we continued to manage operating costs very tightly, allowing us to gain more operating leverage in our model. As a percent of sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter declined over 200 basis points compared to the prior quarter, and declined over 300 basis points compared to the same period a year ago. Operating profits before tax increased to $351 million or 35.9% of sales, which is 170 basis points higher compared to the prior quarter and 270 basis points higher than the same quarter in the prior year. Other expense in the fourth quarter was approximately $4 million and represented the net interest expense on our debt. Our annual tax rate was lower than the rate we had anticipated at the end of our third quarter. As a result, we trued up our tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, which had the effect of increasing the fourth quarter EPS by $0.10 per share. Even when excluding the positive impact from the tax adjustment, diluted earnings per share grew 21% sequentially on the 13% increase in revenue, and was again above the high end of our guidance. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was very strong. Excluding a special payment associated with the conversion of our Irish pension plan, ADI generated $422 million or 43% of sales in operating cash flow, and CapEx was $46 million, resulting in free cash flow of $376 million or 38% of revenue. Fiscal year '15 capital spending was $154 million, and our plan for 2016 is for capital spending to be between $140 million and $160 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3 billion, with approximately $700 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2.1 billion. During the quarter, we returned $237 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which included higher share buyback activity of $112 million, as our buyback program responded to the volatility in our stock price. On November 23, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on December 15 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 4. Now let me take a moment to talk about our performance in 2015. Revenues of $3.4 billion increased 20% over the prior year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 33% to $3.17. Our cash flow generation was strong during the year. Excluding the previously mentioned Irish pension plan, operating cash flows were 33% of sales or over $1 billion, and free cash flow was 29% of sales or $978 million for the year. During the year, we returned $718 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We also increased our dividend by 8% in fiscal 2015, which was our 12th dividend increase in the last 11 years. All told, ADI had a very good fourth quarter and fiscal 2015. Our financial model converted top line growth into very strong earnings growth, and we continued to generate strong cash flows, while enhancing shareholder returns. So now to our outlook for the first quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis, and exclude special items that are outlined in today's release. Our current expectations for the first quarter of 2016 is for revenue to be in the range of $805 million to $855 million, which would represent a sequential revenue decline of approximately 18% to 13%. It is important to note that excluding consumer, ADI revenues at the midpoint of this range are expected to decline sequentially at a mid-single-digit rate, which is in line with seasonal trends. The most significant sequential revenue decrease is expected to be in our consumer business, which is seasonally down in the first quarter, but will likely exhibit more pronounced seasonality after a very strong fourth quarter in which it grew 53% sequentially. In the industrial and automotive markets, we also believe that seasonal trends will largely prevail. Our communications infrastructure business is expected to remain relatively stable to fourth quarter levels, ahead of seasonal patterns on a continuation of the modest, but steady recovery in this market. The midpoint of our guidance range represents an increase of 8% year-over-year, and would mark the 9th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases for ADI, which would be quite a good achievement. Given our plan for lower sequential revenue, and as is typical in our first fiscal quarter, we are reducing production levels in the first quarter to approximately 60% from their current mid-70% level. As a result, we expect first quarter 2016 gross margins to be approximately 64.5%. By remaining disciplined on our production levels, we believe inventories will be well-positioned to support strong leverage once we resume sequential revenue growth. We expect operating expenses in the first quarter to be between $274 million and $279 million, which would represent a sequential decline of approximately 6%. We're planning for our tax rate to be approximately 14% in the first quarter, which is also our planned non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2016. In total, excluding special items, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be between $0.65 and $0.73. At the midpoint of this range, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 10% year-over-year, and this would represent the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings per share growth for ADI, which would also be a very good result. We believe that our financial results are a good proof point that our strategy to focus on sustainable innovation across diverse applications and markets is working. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vince. Vincent Roche : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave and Ali have highlighted, fiscal '15 was a very good year for ADI in terms of our financial performance. Our strategy, which emphasizes technology innovation and platform reuse across a diversity of applications, proved itself once again. Thus, even though the uncertain macro economy impacted industrial and automotive, and cyclical headwinds reduced communications infrastructure sales, these were more than offset by significant uptake of our signal processing technology in portable consumer devices. It was also an excellent year in terms of key accomplishments. In 2015, we successfully integrated Hittite and expanded available opportunities that we believe will deliver strong revenue synergies starting in 2017. Our integration teams and processes are finally tuned and have successfully achieved our 2015 cost synergy targets, which are expected to accelerate further in 2016. During the year, we continued to align our investments to critical strategic priorities, streamlining our management structure, while making investments to support our future growth. But as we take stock at the end of this fiscal year, I think it's important to look at our past performance over a longer period and provide investors some context on where we have come from and where we want to take our company. Over the last 3 years, despite an uneven macroeconomic backdrop, we have grown our revenue at an 8% annualized growth rate, and we have converted this top line growth into 14% diluted earnings per share growth. We've also been committed to returning cash to our investors. Over the last 3 years, we have grown our dividend at a 10% annualized rate while returning $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks. And our annualized TSR over this period is 16%, which is in fact higher than the S&P 500 return over this period. As Dave mentioned, ADI's FY '15 diluted earnings per share were $3.17, and it is our goal to increase our non-GAAP earnings per share to up to $5 by fiscal 2020. And I think this is also an opportune time to point out that as we stand today, we are in fact ahead of the schedule and reaching this goal. We've also invested and continued to invest in future growth opportunities. Over the past 3 years, we've invested over $4 billion in future growth initiatives through R&D, M&A and capital additions. These are significant investments that we believe have been made at the right time in our company's history, and hold us in good stead for the coming opportunities that we believe will drive our future growth. Over our first 50 years, we have created a tremendous market share position in the foundational technologies that form virtual bridges between the physical and digital worlds. When customers need to reliably sense, measure, interpret and connect physical, chemical and biological phenomena to computational domain, ADI has become their go-to supplier. It is our view that as the world becomes increasingly connected and machines become more autonomous, the demand for more and more virtual bridges is quite likely to increase, and this trend clearly plays to our core capabilities. In our terminology, we believe that the information and communications technology sector has entered its third wave. The first 2 waves were dominated by big iron, personal computing, mobility and connectivity. Various monikers are being applied to the third wave, such as the Internet of Things, Industrial 4.0 and so on. Whatever it's called, it's going to be about the pervasive use of artificial sensory and computing power for people and machines to see, to hear, to feel and so on throughout the physical space. As this third wave begins to take shape, it is creating growth opportunities for ADI that we expect will be beyond those achieved in the prior 2 waves. ADI's 50 years of signal processing leadership is at the center of this third wave. With the combination of the cloud and big data, we can enable a real-time understanding of what's going on in our world, so that we can act, react and predict in high-value applications in areas such as healthcare, industrial and automotive applications for example. In fact, existing and new customers are inviting ADI to help them to build even more virtual bridges to enable them to unlock the latent value, and create potential new revenue streams. For example, many of our industrial customers, who in the past, may have worked with us to control the most valuable engines and industrial machines are today looking to massively instrument those very same machines, and capture the value created by the data they generate. The value of the information generated, in fact, has the potential to become even greater than the value of the actual thing it is connected to, and this is very exciting for our customers, and in turn, it's also very exciting for us here at ADI. We are the acknowledged market leader in converters and amplifiers, 2 of the most critical technologies that bridge the physical and digital worlds. And we've also focused significant technical talent over many years on the development of ultralow power sensors and microcontrollers that are optimized for reliable, power efficient IoT solutions. Equally as important, our recent acquisition of Hittite means that ADI also possesses the full range of connectivity solutions necessary to transmit data to the cloud for analysis of trends and patterns, and then, back to the node to be acted upon. We've made steady progress this year in applying our silicon technology and algorithm heritage and strengths in deep domain and applications knowledge of the physical edge to create complete sensor to cloud solutions that are efficient, secure and reliable. This creates the possibility for ADI to not only create but also to capture additional value as we move more deeply into the information spectrum. We will continue to build momentum in these novel growth applications in the years ahead, while ensuring that we continue to strengthen our technologies and customer engagements in our core business. At ADI, we're very excited about applying our expertise to create solutions that solve the most important problems, leading to smarter cities, smarter buildings and factories, as well as transforming health care, and ultimately, people's lives. Now these are just some of the myriad applications, with which we are helping our customers. Our customers are increasingly involving ADI early in their innovation conversations, and leveraging our capabilities to architect solutions to these very tough challenges. As the third wave takes route, we expect that growth from these high-performance solutions will drive future revenue and profit growth for ADI. So before I finish, I would just like to reiterate our outspoken strategic objectives. Firstly, we believe that innovation drives business success. We focus on sizable markets that value the performance we deliver in high-value areas at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. Secondly, we believe in diversity of markets, applications and customers. We place many modest new product bets in carefully chosen applications, and engage directly with the customers that represent a very large part of our served available market. Diversity ensures sustainability and resilience, and this has been proven by our ability to successfully navigate the extraordinary transitions in the semiconductor industry over the past 50 years. Thirdly, innovation and diversity enable ADI to build wide and sustainable economic moats that enhance shareholder value, and of course, this is all made possible by the talent, the ingenuity and passion of our global workforce, who continuously raise the standards and technology, customer engagement, supply chain and myriad other areas in a business as complex as ours. As the markets we serve move closer to ADI, I firmly believe our best days lay ahead of us. Thank you. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Vince. For those listeners interested in learning more about ADI and the IoT space, we recently webcast a 45-minute presentation that actually goes in with this topic in much greater detail. You can find all that information on our IR page. Okay. So let's talk quickly about how we run the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, let's go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Romit Shah : Dave, just historically, April has been one of your better periods in the year. I think, on average, probably up mid to high single digits, but now that consumer is such a more significant portion of the business, how do you think about seasonality in the April period? David Zinsner : Thanks, Romit. I think you're right in that, obviously, when we are more concentrated in industrial, we would have seen a much bigger ramp seasonally in the second quarter, which we expect to see that seasonality in the second quarter for industrial, but consumer now is a larger portion of our revenue. It's a bit of a wildcard. I think that, that quarter is generally seasonally down a little bit. Obviously, we don't have any visibility into the quarter yet, but that would mute a little bit the sequential increase that you would typically see in the second quarter. But as you know, this is a semiconductor business, and you never really know how things will pan out until you're really up on top of that quarter and can make a better determination. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : So look, what happened in October and January, a little more revenue volatility than historical at ADI. So I guess to continue on Romit's question, how do we think about seasonality in 2016? And with that $980 million quarterly revenue bogey, what gives you confidence you guys can exceed $980 million in either the July or the October quarter in 2016? Maybe just talk about just visibility on the consumer front. David Zinsner : Yes. I mean, this is -- we'll have obviously a larger consumer business. Generally, the second half of the year is much stronger than the first half of the year at least from a fiscal year basis for us, given that that's generally when new product launches happen, Christmas builds happen and so forth. So that will definitely change the seasonality a bit for the overall company. My guess is that typical seasonality for ADI is going to be relatively similar sequential increases every quarter for different reasons. Obviously, the second quarter will be more of an industrial story. The third and fourth quarter will likely to be more of a consumer story. And what was your other question, Chris? I missed it. Christopher Danely : Just talk about visibility on the consumer front. How do you feel about maintaining market share there in the second half of the year? Will this exceed $980 million in revenue? David Zinsner : Well, again, we have real confidence in revenue when we actually have orders. We have orders usually out about through the following quarter. So it's difficult for me to say what's going to happen over the next few quarters. But I would say our position with all of our large customers is very strong, and we expect to have a strong position with all of those customers out for the distant future. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : I guess another question on the consumer side. If you look at the revenue ramp over the last several quarters, the vast majority of that's been driven by force touch. You guys are a relatively new supplier for a new application that the customer feels is important enough that they actually highlighted in kind of their advertising, and we know there's been some yield issues on the module away from you. And if we kind of try to get back into your sort of revenue coming from force touch and try to equate that to a unit number for your customer, it does appear that you're over shipping. And so Dave, I was wondering if you could help us understand, when you look at the January quarter, do you think you are over shipping to your customer right now? And when you look at the guidance for consumer, in the January quarter, do you get most of that back in January, so you feel more comfortable that you're not over shipping the demand right now? David Zinsner : All right. Let me start by saying that, obviously, we don't talk about individual products and individual customers. Our customers don't appreciate that, and it's really up to them to start talking about what their end markets are doing and their applications are doing, but I'll talk to specifically about our consumer business. Clearly, the first, -- or the back half of this year had a very good ramp. And that was driven not by one single product, and quite honestly, not by one single customer. We did announce in our 10-K, we had a 13% customer for the year. So obviously -- and that's unique. So obviously, we do have one customer that did quite well. But there are a lot of things that did very well for us in the consumer business in the back half of the year. So that's one thing, I think, everyone should keep in mind. Clearly, when you have a big ramp like we did in the fourth quarter, and we telegraph a decent sequential decline in the first quarter, that would indicate something is going on, and I think it's safe to assume that there probably was inventory that built in the fourth quarter for reasons that are specific to those customers and how they want to manage their supply chains and so forth. But I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary. That, I think, is relatively typical for how those customers manage their inventory, and as is the first quarter decline, which I think starts to digest that inventory. I don't know how long it takes for that whole thing to kind of smooth out, a consumer business of this size, particularly driven off of portables is a bit different for us than we have historically had a position in. So you want to kind of see how it goes, but we'll -- my guess is that it picks back up in the third and fourth quarter and does quite well. And all of that stuff will make sense to all of you guys to try to back into end consumption and so forth. Operator : And your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : Dave, on the gross margin outlook, with the sequential decrease, can you just frame up some of the gives and takes? Because it would seem like mix would be a tailwind to gross margin, but volume looks like a headwind. What was utilization in the quarter and where do you think it is from the outlook? And what is your ability to control the inventory mean for the gross margin trajectory as we look out to the April quarter and beyond? David Zinsner : Yes. So I think I talked about utilization was in -- help me out, Ali. What... Ali Husain : Utilization in the quarter was about 70%. David Zinsner : Yes, it's 70% Ali Husain : But we're bringing it down to about 60% in the first quarter. David Zinsner : Right, and so that's -- that obviously will drive most of the gross margin decline. There is a bit of a mix also, as you point out, that is driving a little bit of the gross margins. I would say that the mix decline, fourth quarter to first quarter, has a little bit more to do with, believe it or not, mix within the industrial space, not mix within our broader business categories. And so that's what will drive the gross margins on the -- after that, obviously, we'd expect to be bringing back our utilization. Hopefully, seasonally, we see a strong industrial ramp in the second quarter and that would certainly drive better volume within the factories and should get the gross margins back up to the levels that we see today. Ali Husain : Our industrial business today, Craig, is about 10-odd-percent off of its revenue peaks that we achieved back in sort of the third quarter of 2014. So I think our goal here is to really get the inventories in good shape, which we're trying to do here in the first quarter with pretty low utilization rates precisely for that reason, to get inventories in good shape for what we hope will be sort of a seasonal second quarter. Obviously, it's too early to call that at this stage. But if we do see sort of seasonality in the second quarter, then industrial generally does better, and we should see some pretty good gross margins and drop through at earnings. So I hope that answers the question and let's get to the next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. So your backlog is up 16%. Is there anything I can read into that number? And I'm thinking especially, since your backlog is obviously for several months further out, if we sort of take the consumer out of that equation, does that number sort of signal that your industrial and communications business is strengthening? David Zinsner : Well, I think -- yes, most of it is, I think at the midpoint of our guidance, we're looking at 8% year-over-year. Because if I'm not mistaken, the backlog that you're talking about, Tore, in the 10-K, is a comparison of the backlog coming into last year versus the backlog coming into this year. And we are predicting revenue to be up 8%. So it's not surprising that backlog would be up. The other thing is, I think in some cases, the consumer business, which will be up year-over-year probably pretty meaningfully, gives us a little bit more visibility than some of the other markets. And so from a mix perspective, that actually helps on the visibility in terms of backlog. But it really isn't extending the visibility at all. It's still all shippable within the quarter and for the most part and really doesn't influence how we would think that the second quarter would pan out. Ali Husain : And let me just, Tore, give you a little bit of color. You mentioned specifically industrial and communications infrastructure. So let me just give you a little bit of color around the bookings in the quarter. For industrial, we saw August quite weak as it generally is seasonally in that month. September was actually quite stable, which is a bit of an anomaly, really, in the industrial business. Generally speaking, September comes back quite nicely. This time around, it was actually quite stable to August levels. And I think if you remember back, there were some pretty screaming macro headlines at that point in time. Interestingly then, the October month actually was quite strong for the industrial business. And November seems to have leveled off here a little bit. And I think we're feeling pretty good about the environment, generally thinking about a pretty seasonal sort of environment for the first quarter for industrial. We haven't mentioned it yet, but the weeks of inventory and distribution were 7.5 weeks, consistent with the prior quarter. Our deferred gross revenue balance, which was a pretty good proxy for inventory in the channel of revenue dollars, was down 2% in the quarter. So I think it's all sort of hanging together there as far as we can tell here for the next quarter, and that's sort of -- definitely in our guidance. On the Communications Infrastructure side, it was up 12% sequentially this quarter in terms of revenue. Wireline was down somewhat, so the implication there is that wireless actually did better than the 12%, which it in fact did. I think most of that we told you last quarter that we felt that we were under shipping end demand in that space. I think a lot of that this quarter in terms of revenue performance was a result of inventory coming back in line with end demand. We're starting to see some good base station deployment activity there, although still, it's obviously early to call. But in terms of the order flows in comms during the quarter, we actually saw better order flow every month of the quarter in the comms space. So that's where we're at. I hope that answered the question, and let's get to our next caller. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Just wanted to discuss your approach to capital allocation. If I look at it, you've had a healthy mix. You're certainly focused on dividend increases, the Hittite deal, opportunistic M&A. On the M&A front and especially as the industry consolidates, just how you approached that relative to the return of cash and any type of metrics you're most focused on. David Zinsner : Thanks, Craig. Yes, so obviously, we are focused on the dividend. We mentioned it in the prepared remarks that we would like to see that continually increase. I think we've got 12 increases in the last 11 years. So we'd like to keep on that pace. We do, do opportunistic buybacks. We think some of our shareholders do favor the buyback or at least appreciate the buyback. And so we have maintained a relatively consistent approach. It does tend to buyback more when the stock is weaker, which I think is -- provides a good return on investment for the shareholders. And then lastly, as you pointed out, Craig, we do have an M&A approach. We are -- we have a very high bar in terms of M&A. We don't -- we certainly don't look or bang the -- kick the tires on a lot of deals. We pick ones that are of very high-quality. It really starts with companies that have a high degree of innovation and where that innovation is, I guess, complementary to our own technology with our existing customer base. And so we will do deals from time to time. They generally will be in the Hittite kind of size range or probably lower in some cases. We're actively looking at things. When you look at -- when you tend to look at businesses that do have a high degree of innovation, it usually comes with really good gross margins, very good operating margins, very good returns on R&D investments and so forth. So I think from a financial perspective, those are somewhat of the outputs as opposed to the inputs. But they do -- those do tend to go hand in glove with really innovative companies. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani : I guess one of the biggest things that people tend to talk about you guys recently is just the concentration issue with your largest customer at this point. So maybe if you just talk about the solution of the products you have with your largest customer, the potential to expand that into other solutions and to other vectors, be that consumer [indiscernible] different sectors. And would you ever look at M&A as a way to diversify concentration? Vincent Roche : Well actually, we have never been more diversified as a company. We have more products in the portfolio than we've ever had. We address more customers than we've ever addressed. So we're actually, as a company, in a very, very good position on that front. With regard to the consumer market in general, we have very strong leverage from our core technology platforms. In the consumer business, it tends to be more of a precision-oriented product-development effort. And so we get very strong leverage, for example, from our industrial product base, which tends to be precision-oriented inherently. So we're looking always for areas. Innovation comes first for us. We build the core technologies. We platform-ize the technology, bring it to as many applications as we possibly can. And in the consumer area, we're picking out the very, very highest level challenges that we can possibly address, and we believe those problems are sustainable over time. Of course, time will tell whether that's well founded or not. But we believe we're in a very, very good position. And as Dave mentioned earlier, even within the -- each customer, we look for diversification of applications and products and technology, and that is the case everywhere we're playing in the consumer area as well. David Zinsner : And I'd just add, on the M&A front, we don't drive our M&A off of a kind of a diversification approach because we're concentrated with one customer. We do pick usually companies that have a lot of diversity. And by virtue of that, we do get a lot of diversity. But our first and foremost objective is to find really great technology that complements our existing technology. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial. Christopher Caso : Yes. Question on the comps space and some of your -- follow up on some of your comments there. I guess just particularly within the wireless part of that space, do you think the excess inventory within that space has been digested at this point so that going forward, the growth in that segment should be proportional to the growth in base station deployments and obviously, understand that those base station deployments are well below their prior peak? Ali Husain : Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, never say never, right? I mean, it's a lumpy market for a reason. But our sense, when we look at the order flows, when we talk to our customers, is that, that period of time where the inventories were massively drawn down is behind us. So obviously, we can't speak for other companies and other suppliers. But what we can tell for our products, what we're shipping into the space at the current moment is pretty well balanced within demand in the space. And frankly, when we looked at the order flows and we were thinking about the guidance for the first quarter, generally speaking, the first quarter is down in sort of high single digits sequentially for the comms space. And this time, if you back into the guidance, we're implying it will be fairly stable. So if you look at the regional perspective, North America has been pretty stable. China now has started to deploy TD and FD. Again, it's slow, but it has started, and so we saw some impact and some good benefit for that in our quarter. And if you look at our emerging regions, they continue to deploy. We had a particularly good quarter in India this quarter, for example. So I think things are moving. I think they're slow and steady. But at least, they're going the right direction. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : Vince, you highlighted what sounds like what could be sort of a virtuous cycle between your comm infrastructure and market on one hand and the other 3 end markets. And I guess it sort of raises a question as to which of these you expect to grow fastest as you enter this environment or this thing you described as sort of the third wave? And I also wonder whether consolidation plays into that thinking and whether M&A sort of plays into the thinking of where to position relative to the virtuous cycle of data development. Vincent Roche : Yes, great question. So we have a long-term model for growth. We believe that the markets that we can, if you like, leverage most in terms of driving growth are at the upper end of our 2 to 3x GDP model, are the automotive and communications infrastructure areas. And I still believe that to be true. We put out some targets last year at the Analyst Day. And I think those targets are still valid there. Obviously, consumer is going to be at the upper end of that as well. I think if we can, over the long-term, -- and we have, certainly for the last 3 years, have been able to drive our industrial business at a couple of times GDP level, we'd be in very, very good stead well into the future. And what I've given you in terms of those targets is really about what we do organically rather than whether we have to buy more heft. As Dave has indicated, we're always scouting around, looking for technologies that make more of an impact to the overall solution that we deliver to our customers. And we're taking more of a strategic view rather than a financial view or an operating view of M&A. So it's more about finding those bolt-on technologies that make ADI more relevant, make our technology, product offering more powerful in the eyes of the customer. But generally speaking, I think we're in a very, very good position to organically take care of our future. Operator : Our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong : When we look at your industrial and communications segments and year-over-year comparisons, do you reckon these numbers reflect the end markets? Or are they suppressed by any rationalization of product lines or customer action following the Hittite acquisition? David Zinsner : Well, I -- obviously, in the first quarter of 2015, we had Hittite. So there really -- it's a direct comparison. I mean, I guess I do -- in the communications business, we are certainly operating at what is a lower level than what we think is the normal build-out of base stations on a year-on-year basis. So it's impacted by the reduction in spending in wireless infrastructure in a couple of different markets. Granted, it is recovered from its trough, but it's not certainly at what would be considered normalized levels. I think in the industrial business, it's -- it was a relatively on a year-over-year basis, a relatively modest increase but kind of within what a GDP-like growth rate has been. So I would say that probably reflects kind of normal end demand in those -- in that market. Vincent Roche : Yes, I will say, David, just to add a little more color, we had a record quarter with regard to the Hittite portfolio in the quarter just gone. And given our relatively depressed communications market though there was some recovery, what I've been most pleased about is the diversity of the applications we're able to target outside of the Communications Infrastructure business with that portfolio. Operator : Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : The -- I think Ali said in the prepared remarks that the auto CAGR has been going about 9% over the past few years, pretty solid performance. That's decelerated a bit, kind of flat growth here in fiscal '15. Looks like, given the guidance around Q1, that's probably going to be flat year-over-year. The team has talked about a better design win pipeline in terms of dollar cost it captured in 2016 within the automotive segment, and so I guess the question is, is the team still relatively confident about the potential for re-acceleration in automotive? And then which subsegments are you going to see more of the growth, is it in powertrain and safety? Are you going to see some growth in Infotainment as well? Vincent Roche : Yes, good questions. So we've had a lot of inquiries over the last couple of quarters about our performance, specifically in the automotive sector. And what I'll tell you is that it's really a tale of 2 businesses during 2015. It was a relatively flat quarter. And when you extract -- I think I've mentioned before to you that our MEMS safety business has had some, no pun intended, some speed bumps along the way here. And -- but our automotive business, with the exception of MEMS safety, actually grew in the high single digits year-over-year, primarily in the areas like Advanced Driver Assistance. The predictive safety side of the business has grown at a stellar pace for the company over the last 3 or 4 years. I believe that will be the case into the future. And the powertrain, specifically the sensing part of that business and the battery monitoring control, has done well and will continue to do well. Infotainment is a very diversified area, and we tend to target the high end of that business with our digital signal processing and our data acquisition technology and algorithmic technologies. We've a new technology called A2B, which is a method of moving sound through the car essentially, speech and sound, in a way that is very efficient, very, very low latency, very low weight in terms of the wiring cables and so on. We've a lot of new sensing technology coming into play, an area like AMR, for example, where we are developing a leadership position, which will be a whole new category in that business in the future as cars electrify and become more automated. So I think what you can expect in the automotive business during this coming fiscal year is that the first half will be within seasonal pattern of the current business level. But the second half, I do expect to pick up in the growth of the overall business at the higher end of the growth model, which is 3x GDP kind of level. So we're confident, given the alignment between the products we have and customer programs that we've got, and it's an area where we have been intensively investing and increasing the investments over the past 5 years. So I think we'll return to a growth pattern towards the back end of '16 and beyond. So that's my sense based on everything that I know at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : I just wanted to clarify on this overbuild versus underbuild in consumer so we don't blow it out of proportion. So Dave, on Q4, you mentioned some slight overbuild. Is it possible to quantify that? And then as we then look at Q1, I assume there is perhaps some underbuild. So as you emerge from Q1, are you going to emerge with some signs of shipping into actual demand? And I know it's probably a little early, but how does rough visibility look like for Q2? David Zinsner : We have -- like I said, we got little visibility into Q2, and it's -- will be premature for me to even mention which direction it would even go. Yes, I don't want to -- and I think you've actually put -- point out a good point. I don't want to over emphasize build. Most of that -- we believe, most of the shipments were consumed. But when you have a fourth quarter to first quarter transition like we're talking about, you have to believe that there's some kind of digestion that happens for a little bit of it, which drives us to believe that on a sequential basis, consumer's going to be down, and that's why we're guiding to where we're guiding. And it will probably be down more than the corporate average. Outside of that, I can't give any more visibility. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces within the consumer business, and trying to identify every application and every customer that's going into and figuring out what they're all doing is next to impossible for us. We get the orders, we ship them, and we leave it to them to figure out what to do beyond that. Ali Husain : It's probably a good time to just reemphasize that despite all of this sort of near-term noise that year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter at the midpoint would be 8% with double-digit EPS growth. So thanks for the question, Vivek. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie : Just a quick follow up on the out-performance in the quarter. I think you mentioned that it was due to multiple products here in consumer. Obviously, there's been some discussion of force touch. Can you talk about what products other than force touch were part of the out-performance in the quarter? Ali Husain : I'm not even saying that was a reason of the out-performance in the quarter. All I can say, Steve, is we have several -- many customers within our consumer business. We have lots of customers in the portable side of the business, and we have a lot of different products that go into those applications. So... Vincent Roche : Yes, to give you a sense, we -- again, the products we ship into these applications tend to be precision-oriented in areas like sensing, in audio and also in the area of image processing. So they are kind of the 3 categories you should think about when you think of ADI's position within these portable consumer applications. Ali Husain : Thanks, Steve, and this is Ali here. So as we're 3 minutes short of the hour, I think we're going to keep going with the questions. But I think it's probably -- the time is probably over for those who have re-queued unfortunately. So I think let's just keep going to at least get everybody's first questions in. Operator : Our next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Christopher Muse : I guess, overall, looking for your kind of big picture macro view here. What are your thoughts in terms of where we are in the cycle? Where do you see pockets of health, maybe pockets of weakness and there really speaking geographically? And how all of that shapes up in terms of the recovery picture in the first half of '16? Vincent Roche : Yes, I'm not sure there is a cycle, by the way, anymore in our -- in the semiconductor industry, and I think a lot of the consolidation somewhat ensures that as well. So I think there is a decent match between supply and demand right at this point in time. Over the years, we've all developed methods to deal with the volatility, and we've a lot more transparency, I think, now as well into the areas of supply and demand. So I think in some ways, what you should be looking at for '16 is probably what the macroeconomic climate does, and we've started messaging our growth trajectory or the algorithm we have for growth as well on that basis, some multiple given the various markets that -- in which we play and what they're capable of delivering in terms of macro level growth and modulated by where we are with our products and technologies and our customers in these areas. So I'm not sure there is a particular cycle in our industry anymore. And probably safer to look at what the macro environment does in the various regions. Operator : Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra : To follow-up on your commentary about automotive. What type of market share position do you think you can have in driver assist over the next couple of years and on the basis of your design wins? And how big does it get as a percent of your automotive market? Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a good question, Tristan. I -- off the top of my head, I don't have the numbers. But the growth rate of our advanced driver assistance business has been one of the strongest -- it's probably the strongest growth element, by the way, during 2015. It's a meaningful part of ADI's overall automotive business now at this point in time. We have some very exciting new technology built on some microwave technology that we built on a very, very advanced technology platform that we're about to -- we'll be sampling over this coming year to our customers that will change the game in radar technologies. And so I think when you look at that business overall, certainly, safety is going to continue to be a very important part, given the mandates, and everybody wants more safety. So -- and I think the capabilities that we have as a company as well in active, passive and combining those are predictive, puts us in quite a unique position, actually, to be able to look at the safety problem as a system of problems and tailor our solutions to those needs. Operator : Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Dave, I had a question on the CapEx guidance for the full year and also on -- along those lines, free cash flow margin, given that a higher ROI and a higher operating margin business is going to be a bigger portion of the mix, should we expect that free cash flow margin for fiscal '16 should be higher? David Zinsner : Yes, we're certainly driving the free cash flow to be higher. That is our goal. And then, the portion on the CapEx, I mean, we're striving towards 4% or so CapEx as a percent of revenue. That's really our goal. I think we had a very good year in terms of free cash flow this year. I think we can do better next year with a lower CapEx as a percent of revenue to help drive that a little bit. And there are some things -- we had to -- we did have to build inventory this year up for some ramps that occurred and some last time builds related to Hittite. Those activities are behind us in terms of building inventories. So we should get, I think, a pretty favorable working capital number for 2016, which could help drive a better free cash flow number for 2016 as well. Ali Husain : Yes, and if I can just add quickly, Ambrish, free cash flow for the year excluding the one-time pension payment was 29% of revenue. The model range is 28% to 32%. So I think we're within that range but certainly towards the lower end of the range. And within the quarter, we generated ex that payment, 38% of our sales in free cash flow, which was actually very, very strong, and as you know, we returned 80% of everything we generate to shareholders, either through dividend or buy back. So thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Harsh Kumar : The results, great guidance, great, great results. Let me just ask quickly about wireless infrastructure. It's quite a bit off your -- off the peak that you guys had, I think, in the January part of this year. You're talking about some pretty good trends happening right now as you see it in wireless infrastructure. What is your best view of how the environment's looking as you get into next year and maybe also 2016 for comm? Vincent Roche : Yes. As Ali said earlier on, the -- from a geographical perspective, North America was pretty flat. I think the story in terms of demand has been driven by China over the course of FY '15. The government carrier investigations have had a huge impact on the deployment of infrastructure there. So I think the pace will pick up in the -- we've seen some pick up over the last quarter. Demand has solidified and strengthened. But I think during '16, you will see a pick in the FD deployments. FTD, TD and particularly in the area of, with regard to China Mobile, small cell deployments in the second half of the year to densify the network and get more capacity. And my sense is that 4G, we've seen, for example, in India over the past quarter, some good deployments in an area where the deployment of LTE is really, really, really low and has a long way to go. And I think it will be steady in America and probably grow marginally in Europe as carriers deploy more infrastructure there to catch the networks up from -- in a lot of places still 2.5G into 4G. Ali Husain : So Harsh, I think it's a question of when, not if. And I think we're very well-positioned across all the carriers and all the regions. So inventories look to be in good shape. The orders, hopefully, will hold up. As you mentioned, our comms business is well off its peak, so I think, I look back and it's about 23% off of its recent revenue peak. So I think there's plenty more to go there, and it's a question of when, not if. So thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Had a question on the cash flow in the capital allocation side. You guys have done a great job returning cash, like you said, about 95% of free cash flow in the last year. But that comes somewhat at the expense of domestic cash, which looks like it's down about 20%, 25% year-over-year. So I guess my question is, when you guys have the domestic versus offshore cash, how do you reconcile that with both your cash return to shareholders, whether it's repurchase or dividend? And how does that impact your M&A strategy, if at all, acknowledging you were able to use offshore cash for Hittite? David Zinsner : Yes. It's a complicated web, no doubt. We -- I think in general, if we are returning 80% of our free cash flow back to shareholders, we don't generate at that level in the U.S. And obviously, all of that has to come from U.S. cash flow. So the U.S. entity definitely will be a borrower. And that's why you -- that's why we have $3 billion of cash and $875 million of debt today is because we lever up the U.S. balance sheet. But on a net basis, we still have a net cash position worldwide. And I think that's generally the approach. There are situations in which international cash would be utilized, and as you pointed out, one of those would be for acquisitions. There's also a number of things that we could potentially do outside of the U.S. in terms of acquisitions that -- it's not a very complicated transaction to utilize that cash. So we will use some of that cash, obviously, for M&A. But to the extent we need U.S. cash, we will use the balance -- leverage to get there. Vincent Roche : Yes, and Ross, we have overall liquidity domestically of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which obviously includes the revolver as well. But that gives us plenty of flexibility to do the things that we want to do here in the U.S. So... Operator : Our next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Christopher Hemmelgarn : This is Chris on for Blayne. It feels like it's beating a dead horse here. But I just wanted to kind of drill in on the consumer business. And if you could just talk a little about linearity over the last couple of quarters for the core business there. You've obviously had a big ramp in the consumer wireless space. But just the existing business outside of that big ramp, how has that trended over the past couple of quarters? Ali Husain : I think -- let's just look at the last quarter here. Overall, I'd say orders, excluding the consumer business in August, were down from the prior quarter. They were slightly up in September, and October was very strong as I mentioned earlier, particularly in the industrial space, coming off of sort of a weaker September. So that's generally how it's trended. And I think we've given the guidance here for the first quarter based on what we're seeing in the order flow. So I think if you exclude the consumer business, generally, everything else is sort of trending seasonally here in the first quarter. So thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee. Douglas Freedman : Great. Real quickly, on the -- looking at gross margins, can you give us a sense to the range that we would see between the industrial consumer, auto and comms groups? I know you've mentioned that the industrial is contributing to a little bit of the headwind because it is soft in the guidance. But I would've thought the consumer being below average would also have been a little bit of an offset. Maybe if you could help me just magnify the range that we would see across the businesses so we have a better understanding going forward. David Zinsner : Yes, I'll see if I can give you any color. The industrial business, obviously, is our highest gross margin business, and that is above the corporate average. Communications is slightly above the corporate average. Consumer is slightly below the corporate average, and automotive is slightly below the corporate average. So those are kind of their -- the ranges. The only challenge in that, Doug, is that there's also the dynamic of what gets made in the factory. And so sometimes mix does play a part in kind of factory absorption and how many wafers we produce and so forth. So that's a complicating factor that drives a little bit of the gross margin. But I would just tell you, maybe stepping back from it, we had a very good year in terms of gross margins for 2015. We were 66%. We think that while focusing on innovation, we generally will get very good gross margins in the future. We've got some things that we're looking at, that we continue to execute on that help lower our cost and improve our pricing. In fact, I think over the last few years, our ASPs have been going up. So we think we have a very good opportunity to push those gross margins higher over the next few years. Operator : Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing : Yes. So obviously, you're addressing a lot of opportunities here in converters and amplifiers. You've got good portfolios there. But could you remind us of your view on power management? Is this an area you'd like to get into perhaps to leverage your scale in customer-facing resources? Or is it not interesting at this moment? Vincent Roche : Well, power management as a technology for us, we have good traction in areas like communications infrastructure. For us, we are not trying to build a broad-based catalog of products. What we are doing is taking the capability that we have inside the company in terms of process, technology and in terms of circuit technology and applying that technology to build products that strengthen the overall signal chain, particularly in more kind of vertical applications, where we can get the leverage in areas, as I said, like wireless communications infrastructure. So that is the strategy for the company and power management. And we've made some very, very good progress there over the last 3 or 4 years as we have given up the ghost in trying to build a broad catalog and brand in power. But instead, targeted very, very carefully at the applications, where the interplay of power technology and signal chain technology creates a virtual cycle here. Operator : Our last call comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : I just wanted to ask a follow up on automotive. You gave great color over on some of the tech trends there. But just from a geographic and maybe kind of bigger, macro picture perspective, was China the only area of weakness? Or where there -- any other geographies that also showed softness in the quarter? And in addition to that, just with the potential for interest rates to increase in the coming quarters, do you think the higher cost of lending might impact auto sales as well? Ali Husain : Yes. I think we're not a room of economists here for sure. But let us, at least, tell you what our thinking is, Stephen. So in the quarter, the business trended really as we expected, frankly. It was up 1% sequentially. All the 3 subsegments of automotive were essentially in line and pretty stable during the quarter. When we started the year, the forecast for vehicle growth in China was 7%. And as we're ending the year here, it's down to about 1% or 2%. And China, obviously, consumes a good amount of premium vehicles. For ADI, we've done sort of the back of the envelope map -- math here on our revenue in the automotive space, and it's probably sort of mid-teens impact from sales into China. So certainly, that would have an impact on our revenue. I think when you look across the other regions, I'd say North America has been doing quite well. The European vehicle registrations every month are up. So that's generally a good sign. When you look in North America, the average age of the vehicle is greater than its historical average. Dealer inventories are below their corporate average. And China, they've recently announced stimulus programs on sales tax for automotive. So again, I'm not an economist, and I don't play one on TV either. But I guess from our sense, everything is sort of trending as we would've expected, except, I'd say, for the China region, which certainly has been weaker for the entire industry. And so certainly, we're not going to be agnostic to that. That would have an impact on our sales as well, particularly as China consumes a fair amount of premium vehicles.  So I hope that answered your questions, Stephen, and I guess that's the end of our earnings call here. We're 15 minutes past the hour. As a reminder, our first quarter 2016 results are scheduled for February 17. Again, 8 a.m. press release, Eastern time, 10 a.m. earnings call. So thanks for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Ali Husain : All right, good morning. Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining ADI's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and our investor toolkit at investor.analog.com. As usual, I'm joined this morning by ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. The format for today's call will be slightly different. Today's prepared remarks will be relatively short because we want to devote most of the call to Q&A. So before we start, let's get through some disclosures. Please note the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. And we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we've reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which we've posted at investor.analog.com. And so with all that behind us, let's get started. So as you've likely seen, revenue in the first quarter totaled $769 million, which is about even to the same period in the prior year. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased 21%, but this sequential revenue performance masked what was really a tale of 2 narratives. While weakness in the consumer portable sector exacerbated what is typical seasonal weakness within the consumer market, our business-to-business or B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure combined to perform in line with our expectations. So let me give you a little color on our performance. The industrial market at 45% of revenue decreased 5% sequentially during the seasonally weaker first quarter, which was a good result in a challenging macro environment. Compared to the prior year, the industrial market was stable. The automotive market at 16% of revenue decreased 4% sequentially, with all sectors flat to down and in line with seasonal patterns. As compared to the same period in the prior year, revenue from ADAS, or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, increased 22%; powertrain sector revenue grew 8%; and infotainment sector revenue increased 6%. Turning now to communications infrastructure. Revenue in this market increased 4% sequentially, which was well ahead of seasonal patterns. Revenue from both wireless and wireline infrastructure customers increased sequentially as we believe the trough in the wireless market turns into a nascent recovery. As compared to the prior year, wireless revenues decreased while revenue from wireline customers increased. In total, ADI's B2B markets decreased 3% sequentially. Now in the consumer market. Revenues decreased 60% sequentially to $126 million, and this market represented 16% of sales. While prosumer audio/video applications decreased in line with seasonal patterns, revenue from portable consumer applications declined significantly as a result of weaker than forecasted customer demand in this sector after a prior quarter performance that had far exceeded expectations. So now I'll turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in 1Q '16. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on our first quarter P&L line items will exclude special items, which, in the aggregate, totaled $22 million for the quarter. When comparing our first quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's release. So Dave, over to you. David Zinsner : Thanks, Ali. The first quarter was a challenging quarter as we executed through weaker economic conditions and significant weakness in the portable consumer electronics sector. Nevertheless, our B2B markets combined to perform in line with our expectations and we repurchased $132 million of our shares in response to stock price volatility, which helped reduce our share count by approximately 1%. Revenue in the first quarter totaled $769 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Gross margin of 62.2% decreased 350 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily on higher inventory reserves and lower utilization rates. Inventory on a dollars basis decreased $7 million sequentially. And on a days basis was 128 days on lower sales. Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the mid-50s and we are planning to increase utilization to the high 60s in the second quarter. Weeks of inventory and distribution were approximately 7.5 weeks, consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expenses of approximately $265 million declined $27 million or 9% sequentially and were flat to the prior year as we continued to carefully manage expenses. Operating profit before tax of $214 million were 27.8% of sales, decreased from both the prior quarter and the year-ago period. Other expense was approximately $10 million as we raised $1.25 billion in 10- and 30-year notes. We expect our net interest expense for the remainder of fiscal 2016 to be approximately $15 million per quarter. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 13%, which we expect will be our tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2016. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share was $0.56, which was a decrease of 11% as compared to the prior year on higher inventory reserves and interest expense. Nevertheless, our strong financial model continued to generate solid cash flows, which we used to enhance shareholder returns. Excluding a onetime payment relating to the conversion of our Irish pension plan, over the past 12 months, ADI has generated free cash flow of $1 billion or 30% of sales, and we have returned $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The first quarter was also a strong working capital quarter, during which free cash flow as a percent of revenue increased to 26%, up from 19% in the prior year, which is an increase of approximately 700 basis points. Capital additions in the first quarter were $23 million or 3% of revenue, and we are planning for capital additions in 2016 to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million. In line with our capital allocation strategy, our Board of Directors approved a $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share, which is payable on March 8, 2016. This dividend represents the 13th dividend increase in the last 12 years. At the current stock price, our dividend yield is approximately 3.2%. Our board also increased the authorization under our stock repurchase program to $1 billion as we plan to continue to repurchase our stock during periods of stock price volatility. We ended the quarter with a cash and short-term investment balance of $3.8 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion available domestically. We had approximately $1.7 billion in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2.1 billion. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today's release. While we are cautious about the macroeconomic environment, current order trends in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets suggest combined sequential revenue growth in these B2B markets to be in the mid- to high single digits in the second quarter. In consumer, we're expecting another quarter of sequential weakness within the portable sector of this market. In the aggregate, we are planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of minus 2% to plus 4% sequentially. Gross margins are expected to increase to approximately 65.5% in the second quarter on higher utilization, a more favorable mix and lower expected inventory reserves as compared to the first quarter. We estimate that operating expenses will be up slightly in the second quarter. And as a result, for operating margins to expand sequentially. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.66, which at the midpoint would represent an 11% sequential increase in EPS. We are currently operating at the lower end of our financial leverage model range, and we are carefully managing production levels and operating expenses. As business conditions improve, we should drive better operating leverage. Overall, we estimate that we have approximately 800 basis points of operating leverage remaining in our financial model, based on our first quarter exit rates. While near-term market headlines warrant caution, we believe our future prospects remain strong. We have been deepening and broadening our customer engagements while investing in our most critical technology vectors to support our long-term growth. And together with our operating model, these place ADI on a strong platform to achieve up to $5 in non-GAAP earnings by 2020. And so now I'll turn the call back over to Ali. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Dave. All right, so folks before we get to the Q&A, let's just run through the format. [Operator Instructions] So with that, operator, let's start the Q&A session and folks on the line can ask questions of either Vince, Dave or myself. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : I had a long-term question on the automotive segment for any of you gents who could answer. Auto has been a great business for you long term. Last year -- last fiscal year, it didn't grow. Can you just help us -- sorry, I'm in a hotel room. Can you please help us understand where the business is positioned in some of the newer areas such as ADAS, self-driving car safety. So in that sense, what drove the business in the last 5 years? And what should we be looking at in the future? Vincent Roche : Yes, well, Ambrish, as you know, our automotive business has 3 major components to it. One is the infotainment sector, which is largely built around audio and media products. We have a strong powertrain business, which in the past number of years has been driven really by our strength in battery monitoring and control. And last but not least, the safety business, which has 3 major components, passive safety and active safety, which are largely MEMS-based activities and advanced driver assistance. Now I can tell you that all those sectors grew over the last several years. The infotainment area has grown in the high single digits. Same thing with the powertrain business. And where we've run into headwinds, really, is on the MEMS side of the safety business. The advanced driver assistance piece, in fact, has been growing at a rate of about 20% over the last 2 or 3 years. And in the MEMS area specifically, we have been very careful to exit parts of the business that were commoditizing and focusing our R&D in areas where we can get the kind of returns on performance-driven products. So that's where we've suffered the headwind and it provided a dampening effect over the last year in particular. My sense is based on what I hear from customers, what I hear -- what our business units are predicting, is that in the latter half of this year we'll be back into, I think, a pretty solid growth pattern with regard to automotive in general across all those 3 sectors. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : You talked about order rates in your B&B business being stable in spite of the macro climate. Could you talk a little bit more about sort of the linearity of those bookings? Are they coming in sort of in line with seasonal patterns? Or is there any trends toward strengthening or weakening as we look forward? Ali Husain : Tore, thanks. This is Ali. I'll take this one. I think, if you look at the order patterns throughout the quarter, I think they generally trended -- again ex the consumer business. I'm talking about the B2B business here. They generally trended as we would have expected them to. I'd say November and December were pretty stable. January saw some pretty good strength. I'd say part of that is just the natural cycle there. January tends to be a stronger order flow month than December, just because it has less holidays. Part of it could be there is -- our first and second quarters had the effect of the Lunar New Year, so part of that could be that as well. But I'd say overall, as we now look into February, orders continue to maintain themselves. I'd say when you look at the various businesses, the industrial business is hanging in, in February to January rates. The comms business is off a little bit from its January rates. Again, January was very strong month for the comms business, particularly as you think about some of these wireless infrastructure build-outs in China. It's likely some ordering that happened in the month of January that was likely going to be consumed in February. So I think overall, I'd say it's probably tracking to where we would expect it to be around this time of year, and I think that's certainly implicated in the guidance that we gave for the B2B markets to be in the mid- to high single digits sequentially in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : I want to actually follow up on that. So you're guiding the B2B up mid- to high single digits. You're sort of calling that seasonal. But I think industrial and auto are typically up in the low double digits sequentially in Q2. So is there something else going on, for example, in comm that's offsetting? Or I mean, can you give us some feeling for -- I guess variation across the 3 B2B businesses above or below that average? Because it does seem, overall, you're a bit below normal seasonal for industrial and auto. David Zinsner : Right. Yes, so we actually went back and looked at kind of the B2B in total and by piece. So communications tends not to have as much seasonal effect and it's more a kind of a cycle effect. But when you look at the industrial and automotive, you're right, Stacy. Sometimes, it's in the double digits. Sometimes, it's in the high single digits. Kind of depends on the year. I think partly it depends on where Lunar New Year kind of falls, and sometimes Lunar New Year is in the first quarter and sometimes it's in the second quarter. And so I think a little bit of the effect of perhaps us being on the lower end, just seasonality in those businesses is the fact that Lunar New Year shows up in the second quarter this time around. Part of it is just you have to pay attention to what's going on in the macro environment. And I think we're being prudently cautious given some of the perturbations out there : things going on in China, things going on with our customers who sell into the oil and gas space. And so I think there's a little bit of prudence there. And then partly, I think comms had a pretty good quarter in the first quarter. It's going to probably have kind of a more flattish to up slightly kind of quarter in the second quarter, and that would mute the B2B sequential growth rate as well. But overall, I would say we're kind of pretty pleased with how the B2B business has been operating. It had a better-than-expected first quarter, and so to have the second quarter be a little bit on the lower end of seasonality is, I think, a pretty good outcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : Just some more color on the consumer end market. How do you expect that to trend this year? Have you seen any change to your forecast recently? And do you think consumer revenue in the second half of calendar '16 will be above or below what it was in the second half of calendar '15? David Zinsner : Tough to call the year-over-year growth rates for some. Obviously, we have a good position, I think, in the consumer space, particularly in portable electronic space. We obviously had a really good second half last year. But as the first half of this year has shown, looks like some of that was not real end-demand. And so there might have been a little bit of build of inventory, a little bit -- some inventory build in the second half of last year that we're now feeling the effects of this year. So clearly, on a sequential basis, the second half should be quite strong relative to the first half. I'm not sure how things will work out year-over-year, kind of given that inventory build. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : I want to go back to the nonconsumer or B2B business. And if you look at that revenue over a longer period of time, it sort of peaked out in the October '14 quarter at about $720 million. And even against sort of your guide for April, you're still going to be $30 million to $40 million below that level. And Vince, I think in a prior question, you did a good job kind of talking about the puts and takes in autos. I'm assuming industrial military is really a reflection of just kind of a lackluster macro. I guess my question is more on the comms side of the business, which is still down the most over that period of time. Wondering kind of where you think we are in the comms cycle. Do we get back north of $200 million in revenue at some point? Are there structural barriers to get there? And importantly, if you could give us an update on how Hittite is performing within that division, that will be helpful because I believe October '14 was the first full quarter of Hittite revenue? Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think the situation in the communications infrastructure market is really about -- last year was driven by -- the downturn was driven largely by what was happening in China with regard to regulatory issues, if you like. What we're seeing -- so we came off a very, very low bottom at the very early part of 2015. But my sense is now with -- we're seeing some bookings momentum. My sense is that we'll see a pretty good growth year overall this year in communications infrastructure. There's a lot of innovation still taking place. And we are, I believe, gaining share across the board. Our customers are still driving hard in the wireless area, for example, to increase spectral efficiency, reduce power costs and so on and so forth in their radio systems. And we're right at the heart of that. The combination of ADI with Hittite makes us the, if you like, the supplier of choice when a customer's thinking of that physical layer interface between the air and the bits, if you like. So we're very, very happy with what we're seeing in terms of the revenue contribution from Hittite. In fact, in the past quarter, Hittite was up over the same quarter in the prior year. So I think overall, that's going well in terms of the revenue and profit contribution, in terms of the contribution in improving ADI's capacity to innovate in these radio systems, in 4G. And we're also now starting to get involved in producing, if you like, the architectures for 5G. But my sense is there's still a lot of legs in 4G. And from our perspective, what we're doing is driving technology and product leadership at key customers. And so I think this year will be about what the market does, and the indications are that the market is getting back into a pretty modest buy mode, I think. And the -- as I said, we have some very, very good momentum in terms of design-ins across the globe, which should bode well for '17 and beyond. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : I wanted to follow up on the industrial end market. It looks like it's performing seasonally, but from some of the other companies in this sector, we've heard about some weakness in certain geographies like China. So can you address the trends that you're seeing across your major geographies in that key end market? Vincent Roche : Well, from a geographic perspective, I would say the -- if you talk about the industrial space specifically, we actually had -- the strongest growth we had was in China last quarter, and Europe was the area of slowest growth. So I think it's a case of the macro, the situation in regard to oil exploration has really impacted the situation in America, and to some extent, Europe. But from our perspective, China was the area of strongest performance in the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I have a question on the gross margin line. I fully understand you guys had a fair bit of deleverage sequentially. But I'm wondering if there were any other factors that played in to the margin shortfall that you guys had on a sequential basis? And if you could specifically just maybe quantify the inventory reserves you had to take on the consumer side? David Zinsner : Yes, so as you point out, we -- I think we exited the fourth quarter around 66% gross margins. It came down to a little over 62%. About half of that was the fact that we lowered utilization in the fab. And obviously, when we do that, that has a pretty meaningful effect to the gross margins. And then the other half was inventory reserves. And the inventory reserves were specific to the consumer portable electronics business. We built up inventory to meet what we thought would be backlog in the first and, partially, second quarter. And as that forecast was taken down by the customer we were left with more inventory than we needed in the short term. And so we elected to reserve that inventory for that reason. Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : I just want to follow up on that, Dave. When you look at the consumer business, it's obviously down a lot more than others levered to that customer. Can you just talk about within the supply chain? And you mentioned writing off some of your own inventory, but when you look at the supply chain, was there inventory in that supply chain that you're working through? If you could talk about yields within the modules that your product goes into? And is that cleared up as you look at April, such that you could see an uptick in July as you saw last year? David Zinsner : Yes, I mean, I think that we were a relatively new product. And I think when that happens, I think the whole supply chain probably adds a bit of cushion along the way to make sure that they can all meet the demand. And of course, the end customer doesn't have absolute certainty in terms of what their end demand might look like, and so I'm sure they add a little bit of cushion there. As it turned out, that cushion across the whole supply chain, including the cushion we all had on our own balance sheet, wasn't necessary. And so as a result, you have the effect of an impact to our top line and the need to reserve some of that inventory for possible disposal. So I think, based on what we saw in the first quarter and based on the fact that there was a bit of demand expected in the back half of the second quarter, kind of a resumption to the order flows, we think that this will be behind us by the end of the second quarter and we'll be back to shipping with consumption. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano : This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question about the defense business. So the DoD recently released their 2017 proposal. They expected R&D to increase by about 4%. How close are you -- does this tie into your own defense business? And what are kind of the factors that determine whether it grows above or below this amount? David Zinsner : Well, I mean, I think, what we have seen is that the defense business has actually been performing quite well. In fact, I think in the first quarter, we were up double digits. So we continued to get maybe a disproportionate amount of -- as it trickles down to us, the capital spending that the government allocates to defense. Obviously, I think, anything where the government is adding expense or capital expense to the budgets of defense is going to be a good answer for us. In particular, because I think a lot of what they're doing are these military systems that require a lot of semiconductor, a lot of electronic content. And that obviously is beneficial to us. So we've been very pleased with the performance of the defense business. Obviously, the Hittite acquisition just supercharged it for us and has helped us do even better in that market. We're seeing all kinds of opportunities for our military components into that space. But not only that, we're actually figuring out ways to take things in the rest of our business that maybe were more commercial in nature and addressing those, that content to the military business to even grow it faster. So the pipeline looks great in that space, and I think we'll do very well over the next few years in that market. Vincent Roche : One of the things that's happening in that area is the mass digitization of a lot of old radio and microwave systems. So there's a huge cycle of upgrades that is in play and that will continue, we believe, for the next several years. So as Dave said, the combination of ADI's mixed-signal technology combined with Hittite's microwave prowess puts us in very, very good stead. And we're certainly seeing that in terms of the business growth in aerospace and defense over the last 12 or 18 months, and we expect it to be a good contributor to the industrial story over the coming years as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Great job on the OpEx controls over the past few quarters. How should we think about OpEx beyond fiscal Q2? David Zinsner : Well, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we do expect it to go up a little bit in the second quarter. The second and third quarter gets the impact of salary increases. And so there's kind of a natural lift. Although it's not significant in the second and third quarter, it will happen. After that, I think we're going to be very cautious about how we deploy capital and operating expenses until we're really clear on what the macro environment looks like. And so as we came into this year, Vince really set the edict that we basically are going to kind of keep the pie the same and we'll divide the pie differently based on the markets and product areas that we think are -- have the best opportunity for a return. And I think that's kind of going to be the mind-set for us for the foreseeable future unless things kind of change dramatically on the macro side. Operator : Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Christopher Muse : I guess a follow-up question on the inventory reserve and gross margins. Did you take reserve for your inventory or for inventory at ODMs? Part B, I guess, is that inventory now obsolete? Or could that be a tailwind to gross margin in the back half for the year? And then lastly, in terms of getting back to prior peak gross margin last year of 66.5%, what kind of step up in utilization do we need to see? Ali Husain : Okay, so a three-part question. Good. Yes, so first of all, on the inventory side. That inventory is not necessarily obsolete. So it's possible it could be used in the future. What was the other part of that specific question on the reserves? Christopher Muse : Were you taking reserves for your own inventory, or inventory at your -- at key ODMs? Ali Husain : Yes. No, once it ships out, it's not our inventory anymore. So we don't take reserves on that. This inventory was on our balance sheet. It was in our supply chain. So that's the inventory reserved. It is possible, like you said, if demand were to change in the back half of the year, it's possible that inventory does get sold. I wouldn't rule that out. In terms of the gross margins getting back north of 66%, I think we actually have a great shot at that. We're in, certainly in the first quarter, we were artificially low because of where utilizations were and because of these inventory reserves. We don't expect the inventory reserve situation to repeat itself in the second quarter. But even the utilization is not up to prior peaks. We're thinking it's going to be in the low -- the high 60s rather. And in fact, we've been in the high 70s in prior periods and that's at least 100 basis point improvement to the gross margins. So I think we have a good path towards getting our gross margins back north of 66% and actually probably in relatively short order. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : I'm wondering if you could give us a sense for how large was your largest customer? And broadly, can you talk about diversification in your consumer business? It's obvious the results and the stock has been extremely volatile. And from our perspective, it's very hard to see whether you can or even want to maintain that socket. You might have it this year, but we don't know what the situation will be next year. So could you just give us some color on how we should think about modeling that volatility in your results? David Zinsner : Yes, so in the first quarter, I don't have the number right in front of me, but I think -- I'm fairly certain it was below 10%, our largest customer. And then it's a long tail after that. So we're pretty diversified from a customer perspective. I think it's a valid question as to do we want this business or not. Sometimes, we think about that ourselves based on The Street reactions. But I would tell you, this has been one of the single most successful products we've ever developed in terms of its return on investment. It was a relatively small amount of R&D investment. We were able to utilize technology that was highly proprietary that really cut -- was at the cutting edge of technology, and we were able to redeploy it and kind of customize it to a given customer that really made a difference in their application. And that's kind of our philosophy in consumer and it has always been our philosophy in consumer. And so we're going to continue to do that. There will probably be several different things we will do in the consumer space that will have characteristics like this that require -- that leverage our existing technology and drive great returns. And quite honestly, I think that the long-term shareholders of ADI want us to do that. They want us to drive good return on investment. There may be some volatility that happens from quarter-to-quarter, but over the long run, I think we'll be very happy. One of the things I think we cited was that, excluding this pension fund change-over that we had in the fourth quarter, we will have generated $1 billion in the last 12 months in cash flow. We wouldn't have gotten there without this thing. So we're all about driving cash flow and maximizing that and helping to maximize return on shareholders, and I think that this piece of business and business like this do that. Ali Husain : And I would just add, not only do we generate the $1 billion, but we returned $800 million of that. And given where the cash flows are, the yield on the free cash flow is somewhere around 6% or 7%, which is think 1.5x what the S&P is yielding. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinayak Rao : This is Vinayak calling for Craig. I had a quick follow-up on the comm business. It saw some good growth over the last couple of quarters in the communications side. And now from your earlier comments, it sounds like the business is taking a pause in April. What visibility do you have in that business? What are you hearing from customers? And if you can touch upon the trends you're seeing by geography for that segment. David Zinsner : Yes, so I wouldn't say it's taken a pause. I mean, we do expect it to be flat to up. And so I think it's, certainly, as I think -- and Ali mentioned in his prepared remarks, it's in the nascent part of a recovery. We have a pretty good visibility into the pipeline here because the design cycles tend to be a lot longer, particularly in areas like the consumer space. And so we kind of understand where our traction is in this space. And as Vince mentioned earlier, based on the way we read how things are going to transpire, given the newer technology that we're -- technologies that we're bring out into the wireless comms space, we think we're going to gain share over the course of the next couple of years. In addition, I think that the market has paused as well. Clearly, it paused significantly in China, and there is a real need for higher bandwidth. And as all these devices that we all hold dear to ourselves require more and more data, and video driving a lot of it now. And so our expectation is that there will be some capital spent in the wireless infrastructure space. That's what our customers are telling us. That's what their customers are telling them. We're excited about our position in that space. We think it will only strengthen. And so my guess is it's hard to call this for sure. But my guess is we'll be in a pretty consistent recovery phase over the next 18 months or so. And then, who knows when 5G comes around. But when 5G comes around, I think we're even in a better position, particularly given that a lot of that technology requires millimeter wave which is one of the key reasons we acquired Hittite. Vincent Roche : I think it's a market you've got to take a very long-term view to it. It's a space that we've been innovating in for the last 15, 18 years, as technologies became more and more digital in terms of their communications modalities across the various generations, so we're gaining strength every year in terms of technology and customer penetration. We know for sure that there's going to be more and more demand for spectral efficiency as people use more and more and more mobility, a higher bandwidth data stream is required. So there will be oscillations quarter-on-quarter, but overall, we believe it's a terrific space to be in. We're investing to win in that market in the radio space. And as I said, our position gets better year by year in terms of customer penetration and technology and product quality and availability. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Vince, one for you on the automotive market. That was very helpful earlier when you gave some of those splits to your business. If I summarized it a different way, investors seemed to be a little bit concerned that the automotive market from a SAAR perspective is peaking. Could you give us any details on if you're seeing any evidence of peaking behavior? And then probably more importantly, how do you think of your business being unit driven as far as the unit build in the market versus content driven going forward? Ali Husain : Ross, let the take part of that and then I'll turn the rest over to Vince. I think from a SAR perspective, really what we saw towards the end of our fiscal year was China, particularly with the premium vehicle market there weakening. I think what we're seeing at this stage is that North America is still continuing to be pretty strong. The European vehicle registrations are continuing to be up. And I think very importantly for ADI is that the premium vehicle market in China seems to be stabilizing right now. So that's sort of a macro view in terms of the SAR. And then just secondly, I'd point out from another -- if you take a sort of from another macro view, is that when you look at the dealer inventories out there, those are in good shape. When you look at, again, the average age of vehicles, they're above their historical norms. So that would suggest that there is still some pent-up demand from the SAR perspective. But that's, I guess, our sort of 30,000-foot macro view of what's going on with the SAR, and I'll let Vince take the second half. Vincent Roche : Yes. Maybe just one other piece of additional information, light vehicle sales were strong. As Ali said, the luxury part of the market seems to have at least stabilized, maybe stalled a bit. But light vehicle sales have been stronger than expected in both, certainly, North America and Europe. So -- and part of our -- we were talking earlier just about the diversity of our business. Our business continues to become more diverse as we penetrate Asia more aggressively than we have in the past, building on the strength that we've had traditionally in Europe and America. So I think from our perspective, we've got a stronger portfolio than we've ever had. It's really going to be a case of, from an ADI perspective, how well we penetrate the socket. So irrespective of what happens in terms of SAR, we actually have some good momentum in terms of products and technology, which will enable us to get share. So I think it will be a tale of those 2 pieces. Ali Husain : And if I could just add some examples of the technologies that we're bringing to the market. ADAS systems, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, were up 22% year-over-year. That today is largely a 24 gig solution, and over the next couple of years will be in 77 gig solutions as that modality rolls out, puts us in very strong position to grow. Powertrain systems continue to be strong, again, as carmakers want to make cars more efficient. And finally, on the infotainment front, that's been a good market for us. I don't know if you noticed, but last month we announced a release with Ford Motor Company announcing what we call an A2B bus, which is basically : taking very high-end audio fidelity in cabin; takes out a bunch of weight of the car; still keeps fantastic audio quality within the vehicle. Then at the end of the day, it's a cheaper solution for the car manufacturer. So those are just some examples of the things that Vince was talking about. Operator : Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing : My question is on the comms business, 20% off of the prior peak at this point. Xilinx talked about their comms segment's not likely achieving prior peaks in the near future. They talked about FTD in China being a smaller deployment than TDD. So for ADI, I mean, do you have the potential to reach prior peaks with some different exposure than Xilinx perhaps more on the microwave side? And what sort of time frame do you think that could happen? Vincent Roche : Well, we've got a bigger footprint now than we've ever had. I mean, just the combination of the investments that we've been making for the last several years to make sure that we have the most complete solutions in the radio space, combined with the microwave technologies that we've acquired through Hittite. So I think there are 3 parts we should think about. One is the macro, the macro cell, the small cell. We believe, for example, that we will see growth this year in macro cells. It will be relatively modest. We're also very well positioned in small cells. And I think it's becoming pretty clear that in China, China Mobile is going to deploy small cells this year. We have a very strong competitive mode that we've built in the area of software-defined transceivers that specifically address the small cell arena. And the point-to-point space has been modestly growing. It seems to have slowed as of late. But they're the 3 components. And we've got a bigger footprint. We're getting more penetration. I believe it will be more about market adoptions and what the carriers do in terms of CapEx on hardware versus other things, more so than what we do. So I think we're well positioned as growth continues to gain momentum here in that market. Ali Husain : And Ian, not that I'm keeping score, but we're 19% off of our peak, not 20%. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : Vince, I want to drill down a bit on the distribution channel. Can you discuss the sell-in and sell-through rate [indiscernible] for the quarter and what your expectation is in the current April quarter as well? Ali Husain : Well, I'll take a first stab at that and then I can let either Vince or Dave come in. So when we look at the distributor channel this quarter, inventory on a weeks basis, as I think Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, were 7.5 weeks, which is pretty consistent over the last several quarters. Deferred revenue, which is a pretty good proxy for inventory in the channel at revenue dollars, was down 1% sequentially. So the channel, I'd say, is behaving itself. I think a lot of the inventory is on the supplier balance sheets. And I think folks are doing a good job of managing the actual channel. I think when you look at some of the outlooks painted by some of the larger distributors out there, it appears to be a pretty mixed environment. And of course, if you look at -- that is a proxy for industrial business, as Dave mentioned earlier, if you sort of back into the guidance. We're guiding industrial to be in somewhat of a seasonal range, but likely to be sort of at the lower end of that seasonal range. But I don't know if, Vince, you want to add anything to that? Vincent Roche : I think what you said is correct in terms of you can take our industrial business as a good proxy for what's happening in the channel. So the book to bill is positive at this point in time. And as Ali said, we've got modest expectations based largely by the fact that the macro backdrop is, to say the least, volatile at this point in time. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : This is Mark Lipacis. Dave, you mentioned you're cautious and that there's perturbations in China. But the orders in the nonconsumer businesses seem seasonal given the timing of the Lunar New Year. And Vince noted that the China industrial market was the strongest industrial market. So I'm trying to reconcile what appears to be seasonal order patterns with your cautiousness. Are customers or distributors throwing up flags? Or is there some other analysis or signals that's driving your cautiousness? David Zinsner : Yes, only the -- and when I say perturbation, I mean, what you read in the Wall Street Journal and see on CNBC more than anything. But certainly, in our -- what we see from an order flow perspective would lead you to be -- feel pretty good about the situation from a macro perspective. But I just think we've got to be -- we got to recognize that there is uncertainty in the market. I think our customers generally feel the same, feel this uncertainty and just aren't sure what the outcome will look like for this year. And the result, I think, when those situations arise, it's best to be on the cautious side of things. And if things turn out to be more positive, that would be great. We'll put the money to work at that point. And if it doesn't, we'll have protected our income statement. Vincent Roche : If you look at what our customers are predicting for this point, this year versus the same period last year, it was a lot more caution. I think all the big industrial companies are projecting very, very low single-digit growth or flatness through the year. So you've got to take all that into account when you're trying to run your business here. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee. Douglas Freedman : It really relates to your M&A strategy. We've seen in the market's taking a little bit different tack towards deals in the semiconductor space. Those guys that have chosen to lever up and do things have not been received as well. Does this weigh into your thinking at all? And can you give us an update on how you view M&A? And what the opportunities you see out there today? David Zinsner : Yes, I think that for us, we have a pretty high bar. We have a high bar in terms of it's got to add innovation that's core to what we do. It's got to hit all -- it's got to hit the customer base. It's got to be something that the customers turn around and say, well, \"That was a good idea. We really needed you to have that technology.\" And then it's, obviously, got to check the box on all the financial parameters that we have. And like I said, the bar is pretty high in terms of what we'd like to see from that perspective. And so I think that in that regard, we take a pretty, kind of systematic disciplined approach to it. That's the reason we did Hittite and that's the reason we haven't aggressively tried to find other deals just to fill the coffer with M&A -- an M&A pipeline. What we've done is we've been carefully looking. I would tell you that we've kicked the tires on a lot of different ideas over the last year or so and not one of them has reached the high bar that we set. That's not to say that there won't be one down the road. And I think when that happens, we'll go to our shareholders and I think, given the bar we've set, we'll give them a pretty compelling reason as to why we want to utilize their precious cash to go do that acquisition. And so I think it will end up being positively received in that case. I think we're doing M&A for the sake of M&A, that's when things tend to turn on you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra : As a follow-up to a prior question, what's your sense of the timing for the initial run-up in 5G? And what's the percentage content increase ADI has relative to 4G? And also, what geographies offer the highest growth opportunities for the remaining leg of 4G growth? David Zinsner : Yes, so I mean, usually, when you go transition from generation to generation, it's easily into the double digits bomb increase on those transitions. I can't tell you when exactly 5G will roll out. I'm going to say it's a few years away at this point. There might be little pockets of early adoption. But most of that is a couple of years away, I think, for us. But when it comes, we're well positioned for that. 4G is pretty well, certainly, deployed in North America. Although I think there are areas where it needs to be densified. China still has a few things to roll out depending if they have -- they change I think sometimes what their -- the way they want to deploy that technology. But over time, over the next couple of years, I think, they'll be in a good position. The rest of the world is actually -- outside of maybe a few areas like Korea or something, are actually in pretty old generations, particularly in Europe. And so I think there's a lot of room for 4G deployment before we even get into where the 5G takes us. Vincent Roche : 4G still has a lot of legs. As Dave said, it will be multiple years before 5G comes into play. And you might be surprised to know that if you take the typical customer that we have in the base station area, the macro base station area, the product replenishment rate of the radio is very frequent. There are many, many new radios developed every month for different regions, different spectral usage and so on and so forth within 4G. So there's a lot of innovation and a lot of edge that we can still bring in terms of technology to 4G. And that's what we're doing. When we make the step to 5G, the frequencies increase, the data rates increase. It's got to be much more spectrally efficient than 4G. It needs lower latency and so on and so forth and all to drive the improved coverage and the quality of service. So when that happens, we will have been at the forefront of helping our customers architect what 5G looks like in terms of the radio. So it will be multiple years. But I'm still bullish on 4G and what we can do in that area in terms of bringing ever-increasing levels of innovation and increasing our footprint there. Operator : Our next question is from Deepon Nag with Macquarie. Deepon Nag : Dave, the dividend increase that you did is probably the lowest, I think it's the lowest you've done since 2009. But repurchases in Q1 were at a very high level. So is there a change in the way you guys kind of view your mix of returning capital? And then on fiscal Q2, are you going to take any more inventory reserve? Because the gross margin leverage, I guess, is a little bit lower than what I would've thought just given the mix and the ramp in the utilization rates. David Zinsner : Yes. So no, I mean, philosophically, I guess at the top, we really want to deploy 80% of our cash back to shareholders. And I think the way we look at it, is we try to maintain a balance. Clearly, the stock has weakened a bit since its peak. And so we recognize that the buyback is probably going to be fairly active for at least some period of time. And so I think that was really the primary reason why the dividend increase was smaller because we're trying to maintain the balance to get the return to 80%. I wouldn't read into anything more than that. We do have a stated target that will kind of stay between 5% and 10% a year increases in the dividend. It still stayed within that range. But what -- as you've point out it was on the low end because we think the buyback will be a bit stronger. From an inventory reserve perspective, we think we've taken care of that situation and that we don't expect that to repeat in the second quarter. I'd say the primary reason why the gross margins haven't -- I think, they got up to north of 66% probably in the second quarter of last year. And the reason they're about 100 basis points below that is because of the utilization levels. We aren't ramping the utilization up quite as much this quarter versus last year at this time. And fundamentally, it's just, I think, a mix. There are certain things that get done internally; certain things that we leverage outside partners for; and the way the revenue's going to fall out, I think, for the second quarter is going to be a little bit more disproportionately to the outside wafers that we get from foundry. And so as a result, we won't be cranking the factory up as much in the second quarter. On top of that, we do -- we are focused on the inventory levels of the products we build internally and we didn't want that to get too high. So hopefully, in the third and fourth quarter, this momentum that we think we have in the B2B space continues. That certainly has more wafers manufactured internally. And so we'd expect to see the utilization come up over the course of the year and that will -- should be a pretty good tailwind to gross margin. Operator : Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : I just had a quick follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about the thinking behind carrying $1.7 billion of debt? David Zinsner : Good question, Tore. So when we -- as we came into like that December month, we knew that we had a $375 million bond that was coming due in April of this year. We also thought that we might be using some of the U.S. cash in the near term for an acquisition. And the rates were pretty attractive. The market was pretty excited. And we were particularly excited by the fact that we could get 30-year debt in some cases or in some amounts at rates that, on a tax-effective basis, would be kind of less than the dividend yield. So we thought that those things combined meant that it would be a good idea to go into the market, get the cash and be ready. As it turned out, the acquisition that we were thinking about, we didn't end up consummating. We did refinance the bond, so that utilized some of the cash that we raised. The rest of it does sit on our balance sheet in the U.S. But I think we will, over time, find very good accretive uses for that cash. It was relatively cheap money. We will look to use it in situations where we need U.S. cash for M&A, which is where as I've mentioned we're using some of the cash for buybacks and so that'll obviously be an accretive use of the cash as well. So it -- in terms of net cash, which is the number we're more focused on, we think we'll find ways to kind of bring that down over time. One of the disconnects we have is we generate 2/3 of our cash offshore, but a lot of our uses, like some of the M&A and some of the -- and certainly the buyback activity utilize U.S. cash. And so we sometimes need to add leverage to the U.S. balance sheet in order to make those happen and the cash accumulates offshore. Operator : Our final question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes, I was going to ask the debt question, but I'll ask another one. Vince, can you talk a little bit just about within the consumer space, how we should think about sort of pricing over time and your ability to bring down cost on your solutions that you bring to the consumer market, especially as you go into sort of second- and third-generation products from your customer? Vincent Roche : Well, John, we're very discriminating in terms of how we play the game everywhere, not just in consumer, everywhere. But particularly in consumer, we've been very clear that we need to have a strong grasp of the complexity of the application and the quality of the solution that we're bringing. So we're playing really at the high performance edge. There are many, many things we can do. But we are very discriminating about the things we take on, and we are -- that's the basis on which we're playing. So we're leveraging, if you like, precision core technology that we sell into many, many different sockets in many, many different applications. And I think as Ali said earlier that we're -- if we hit the right places, we get terrific ROI on a technology that we customize in a particular application space in consumer. So I mean, that's the pieces. That's how we play within that space and we -- when we hit it, we hit it very, very well. Ali Husain : Great. Well, thank you, John. Thanks for all our callers this morning. I have to admit, I do like this morning call. As a reminder, our second quarter '16 results will be issued Wednesday, May 18, 2016 at 8 a.m. Eastern and the earnings call will begin 2 hours later at 10 a.m. Eastern. So thanks for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you soon. And for those in Massachusetts, enjoy the school vacation week. Thanks.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the Web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the Analog Devices Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and the investor toolkit, which includes additional information that we believe will be useful for investors, and all that is at investor.analog.com. As usual, I'm joined by ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. So before we start, let's get through some disclosures. Please note the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we've reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which we've posted at investor.analog.com. And with that, let's get started. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $779 million, which was up 1% sequentially and down 5% from the prior year. On a sequential basis, our business-to-business or B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure experienced broad-based demand, growing 9% sequentially and more than offsetting a weak consumer market. So let me give you a little color on our performance by end market. While overall macro trends were fairly mixed during the quarter, ADI's highly diverse industrial markets grew 11% sequentially and represented 49% of revenue. All of the major application areas within industrial such as factory automation and industrial instrumentation grew sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter. And we also had a particularly strong performance in the aerospace and defense vertical.  The automotive market at 18% of sales grew 9% sequentially in the seasonally strong April quarter. Growth was broad-based across all of our automotive-focused applications of safety, ADAS, powertrain and infotainment.  Turning now to communications infrastructure. Last quarter, we had talked to you about a nascent recovery in this market, and we're happy to report that this trend continued during the second quarter. Revenue from communications infrastructure customers at 23% of sales increased 4% sequentially, with both wireless base station and wireline applications revenues increasing over the prior quarter. After troughing in July of last year, communications infrastructure revenues have grown at a slow and steady pace. And we believe we're still in the early stages of a recovery in this market. So in total, ADI's B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure grew 9% sequentially in the second quarter. In the consumer market, revenues decreased 37% sequentially. At current quarterly run rates, we believe that our consumer business is at trough levels. In total, consumer represented 10% of revenue in the second quarter. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the second quarter. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Dave's comments on our second quarter P&L line items will exclude special items, which, in the aggregate, total $33 million for the quarter. When comparing our second quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release. So with that, Dave, it's all yours. David Zinsner : Thanks, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Our strategy to focus on diverse products, customers and markets enabled really good performance in the second quarter. We also repurchased $214 million of our stock in response to price volatility, which enabled the third consecutive quarter of share count reduction.  Revenue in the second quarter totaled $779 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.64, with both results above the midpoint of guidance. Gross margins of 65.8% increased 360 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily on lower inventory reserves and on factory utilization rates that increased to the low 70s. Inventory on a dollars basis decreased $5 million sequentially and on a days basis increased to 138 days as we staged inventory for an anticipated consumer revenue ramp and managed Hittite-related last-time buys. We expect both dollars and days of inventory to decrease over the next 2 quarters. Turning to inventory in the distribution channel. Inventory in distribution on a dollars basis was modestly higher than in the prior quarter, and weeks of inventory in distribution decreased to 7 weeks from the prior quarter's 7.5 weeks. Operating expenses increased 3% sequentially to $272 million, in line with our plan. Operating profit before tax of $240 million increased 12% sequentially and as a percent of sales expanded 300 basis points to 30.8%. Other expense in the second quarter was approximately $13 million, and that represents the run rate of our net interest expense. Our second quarter tax rate was approximately 12%. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the remaining 2 quarters of the year to be approximately 12.5%. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share of $0.64 increased 14% over the prior quarter.  Our business franchise forms the foundation of our strong balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.8 billion in cash, net cash of $2 billion and a leverage ratio of 1.3x EBITDA. We also have $1.7 billion of liquidity in the U.S., which we plan to use for investments in our business and for general corporate purposes, including dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions.  During the second quarter, free cash flow as a percent of revenue increased 190 basis points from the prior year to 37.8%. Excluding a onetime item, over the last 12 months, ADI has generated $1 billion in free cash flow. And over this period, we have also returned that $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, effectively returning 100% of free cash flow over the past 12 months.  During the quarter, we paid $130 million in dividends to shareholders, and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per outstanding share of common stock. This will be paid on June 7, 2016 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 27. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual rate of about 3%.  M&A is a key part of our strategy to accelerate technology leadership and revenue growth. During the quarter, we acquired SNAP Sensor, giving ADI the ability to provide very high-dynamic-range industrial imaging solutions in Smart City and Smart Building applications. So in summary, this was a good quarter on several fronts. The diversity and breadth of our business, coupled with strong execution, enabled revenue and diluted earnings per share results that were above the midpoint of guidance. And our capital allocation strategy enabled a significant return of cash to shareholders.  So now turning to our outlook and our expectations for our third quarter, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today's release. We're planning for another quarter of sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. In our B2B markets, we are seeing stable order rates across the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure sectors, and as a result, we are planning for aggregate sequential demand in these B2B markets to be largely seasonal in the third quarter. Importantly, we expect our B2B markets, in the aggregate, to grow in the mid- to high single digits on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. In the consumer market, good design traction in the portable sector leads us to plan for sequential revenue growth in this market, although it is likely that this revenue growth will be back end-loaded and occur late in the third quarter. In total, we're planning for revenue in the third quarter to increase sequentially and be between $800 million and $840 million. We expect gross margins to remain stable to their second quarter levels despite utilization rates in the low -- in the 60s range as we expect lower spend levels and manufacturing efficiencies to offset the lower absorption. We estimate that operating expenses will be up slightly in the third quarter but that they will lag our expected sequential revenue growth, and we expect even greater operating leverage in the fourth quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.74.  We firmly believe that our future success is within our control. To that end, we are partnering with customers and innovating with impact to drive business success and more importantly, shareholder return. With a strong business model and a focus on the right end markets, we're confident that we can drive ADI's non-GAAP EPS to up to $5 by 2020. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Dave. All right, so folks, before we get to Q&A, let's run through the format. [Operator Instructions] And so with that, operator, let's start the Q&A session, and folks on the line can ask questions of either myself, Vince or Dave. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Just a question on your communications business. You said it's been steadily improving since, I guess, almost a year ago now, but that was still in the early days of some good momentum there. So can you just elaborate a little bit on that, perhaps, maybe both on the wireless and on the wireline side, please? David Zinsner : Yes. So Tore, as you point out, I'll start and Vince will, I'm sure, finish up. But we troughed around the third quarter of last year. And obviously, a lot of the weakness last year was related to China investigations. That seemed to run its course, and we've been steadily improving up to the levels that I think we saw right around the second quarter of last year. I think our position in the marketplace is quite strong. We literally have -- any OEM that's building base stations or else infrastructure communications equipment uses our radios. We also expect that over the next few quarters, we'll start to see a more meaningful rollout of small cell activity in China. We think that will be a good growth driver. We have the lead position from a technology perspective in integrated transceivers, which is going to be the technology of choice in that space. So I think we're in great competitive position. The smart cell activity is going to help drive some momentum just aggregately in the marketplace. And then this whole headwind that we saw in China has started -- has run its course, obviously, and we're starting to see the recovery there. So the momentum and the wind is behind our sails at this point in the communications space. Obviously, it can be lumpy at times, but right now, based on the order flow, we're quite optimistic about the comm space. Operator : The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I had a question on the guidance, and I'm just trying to understand the consumer guidance. And we're notoriously bad in trying to predict Apple units. But if you look at the guide, it looks like it could be a factor of either lower units than what most of us were modeling for or lower ASP or just the overbuild was so high that it's taking a longer time for all that to bleed through the channel. What's the right way to think about it? David Zinsner : I think the way to think about -- I guess you're talking about the third quarter. I think really, the third quarter, as you compare it against the third quarter of last year, is really the dynamics around when the buildup is going to occur this year versus when it occurred last year. I think because we were a new player in that particular application with a new product, our customer ramped a few months earlier than typical for their semiconductor vendors in an effort just to make sure they had everything in the pipeline they needed. I think now we're going to be more consistent with most of the other semi vendors out there that supply into this particular application. And really, that means that we really don't see the demand pickup until the July time frame. So it's probably going to be more of a end of third quarter and more into the fourth quarter this time versus last year, where it was more of a ramp in the third quarter. I would point out that we have -- well, I should say we suspect we have more dollar content in that particular application this year versus last year. And so from a BOM perspective, we will actually be in a better position, and so it obviously, at the end, depends on how the demand of the end product goes. But assuming that goes fine, we will actually see pretty good growth. Operator : Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Jeriel Ong : This is Jeriel on behalf of Amit. I guess looking to industrial business, it's been down year-on-year for a few quarters now. It looks like, given guidance, it might grow year-on-year in the July quarter. Will we see the growth accelerate as we get into the back half of 2016 and then into 2017? David Zinsner : Industrial is hard to predict out 4 weeks so I don't know that we're out -- we're ready to predict what it's going to do out several quarters. I would say that, yes, from our guidance, you can interpret that we suspect the industrial business is going to be up year-over-year in the mid-single digits or so, yes. And as a result, we think we're back in a recovery phase there. It had been weak probably related to kind of the phenomena around oil and gas weakness and maybe some currency issues. That seems to have run its course. And as a result, we think we're back on a recovery trend in the industrial space. The one area of that business that's actually beaten the kind of the macro headwinds has been the aerospace and defense business. That's done very well for us even despite the weakness we've seen out there on the macro side. And as it looks out into the future, it looks like that business will continue to be a pretty strong business for us. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Dave, I just want to talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance for the July quarter. If I look on a year-over-year basis, gross margins are going to be down a little bit year-on-year despite the fact that I think you said in your prepared comments that the B2B business should be up, actually, kind of high single digits year-over-year. Can you just help me kind of square that circle and help me better understand why margins wouldn't perform better if B2B is showing such good year-on-year growth? David Zinsner : Yes. It's a good question, John. We're actually going to bring utilization down in the third quarter into the kind of 60s level. It was actually, I think, in the 70s last year. And that's really -- when we looked at our inventory levels, even though most of the inventory build was related to things within our control, like ramping up for the consumer ramp and also for the buildup related to some foundry transfers that are going to occur related to our Hittite business, we really wanted to keep inventory in check. And so we thought it would be a good idea to bring the inventory down in the products that get -- or related to the products that get manufactured internally. So that's really why we approached it that way. Now we're probably going to bring it down, I don't know, somewhere in the 10 percentage point range at least, and that normally would have 100 basis point negative impact on us. But what we're going to -- what we think we can do is take some of the costs out of the factory in the third quarter, and we think we'll make some improvements from an efficiency perspective. And those things combined will offset a lot of that headwind, and as a result, we think we'll be generally flat. Operator : Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : I wanted to dig in a little bit on automotive. Over the last couple of quarters, you sort of talked about expecting a bit of a second half lift in that business. But now you're sort of talking about seasonal in aggregate for Q3. And frankly, given the rest of the guidance you're talking about, if industrial is up like in the mid-single digits year-over-year and the overall B2B is up in the mid- to high, like I'm coming up with auto probably flat to down year-over-year and probably down decently sequentially, which, I think, would be seasonal. But neither of those things seem consistent with a lift in the back half. So are you sort of backing off on that statement that you made previously? Or like how should we be thinking about automotive as we move through the rest of the year? Vincent Roche : Stacy, we've had stellar growth. We've pointed out before that there's one particular area that we've had a headwind. We believe now that headwind has abated. We've had good growth in areas like infotainment. Advanced Driver Assistance and the powertrain area, we've had good growth. Specifically in active and passive safety, we've had some issues, and as I said, I believe the headwind is -- has abated there now. So my sense is that with the programs we have in place, we'll start to see -- we've bottomed out in the auto MEMS area in terms of the declines. So we will be back on a growth track over the coming months and into the -- during 4Q. So I think the worst is behind us there, and we'll get back into a decent growth pattern from here on and through FY '17. Stacy Rasgon : But is it fair to say that your Q3 outlook for auto was probably flat to down year-over-year then? Ali Husain : No, Stacy. Let me just point out -- let me just make a slight correction here. I think when Dave was talking about mid- to high singles in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, I think the comment was specific to the B2B market. Industrial, we expect to be up on a year-over-year basis in the very low single digits. And so as a result, I think when you look out to the third and fourth quarter, what we're expecting to see in the automotive business is to see some modest year-over-year growth that we think we can accelerate through the back half of the year here. I hope that -- does that help? Stacy Rasgon : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Just a question on that increase in cash returns just really stepping up the last couple of quarters. I mean, clearly, you guys are generating a lot of cash and have a very strong balance sheet. But just wanted to kind of get your sense of how much is opportunistic versus how much may be providing a read on the M&A side, what might be out there and how you're approaching that. David Zinsner : Well, we still have $3.8 billion of cash, so it's not like it's massively influential to how we're thinking about M&A. We're still interested in acquisitions, and that's part of our strategy. Obviously, we have a high bar on those acquisitions, so they don't come every quarter. But we do want to have some dry powder available to us to make those opportunistic acquisitions that, a, can be very strategic for us in terms of driving growth and are very synergistic with what we're doing from a customer perspective; but, b, also deliver a very good financial performance and hopefully accelerate our earnings growth. As far as just the level of buyback that we had in the last couple of quarters, I'd say it's a couple of things. One, it's somewhat programmatic in that when the stock has these dips in the stock price, we take advantage of that and buy stock back. And so I'd say over the last couple of quarters, there were those periods of time where that happened, and on the average, we bought a bit more back than we had been in the past. And also, we just fundamentally believe that the best is yet to come for us. And we think that, that $5 target is a doable target for us, and if that's a doable target, then buying at this price is a pretty attractive price. So those 2 things combined drove us to be a little bit more aggressive with the buyback over the last couple of quarters kind of in response to both the stock price and our expectations on value. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : I wanted to follow up on the increase on both automotive and industrial. Those businesses, in the outlook, look like they're back to nice year-on-year growth. So my question is since those are both businesses that have significant application diversity, where are you seeing the strongest year-on-year gains? And where, within those businesses, do you still have subsegments that would be below last year's level? And what's the prospect for those to reach new highs? Vincent Roche : Well, specific to the industrial area, we've seen tremendous growth in the aerospace and defense area over the last number of quarters. And that's been also bolstered through the acquisition of Hittite. That's helped us a lot. We've been able to combine the franchises of both companies and eke more growth out there. I'd say broad-based instrumentation across the globe has done well. And if you extract oil and gas from the factory and process automation side of things, we've seen good growth there, too. And geographically, I would say in the recent term here, both Europe and China have seen particularly strong growth. On the kind of the muted side there, I'd say on the slower growth side of things, the automatic test equipment and energy sectors have been more turbulent. Energy is flatter, but the ATE thing has been quite turbulent. So that's kind of the picture in terms of the puts and takes on the markets, the subsectors and geographies there. As I said earlier, in terms of automotive, we've seen stellar growth in infotainment, in powertrain and Advanced Driver Assistance, and we've been dealing with this headwind on the automotive -- the passive safety and active safety side of things. Geographically, if I look at automotive, again, America has been very respectable. Europe has been stronger, and China and Japan have been relatively flat. So that gives you, I think, a picture of both of those sectors from a subsegment and geographic standpoint. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Just on the Q3 outlook, I think you may have addressed it at different parts of the call. But could you just give us some more color on each of the B2B segments, how you expect them to trend on a sequential basis and more importantly, how that compares to what you thought, say, 2 or 3 months ago about those segments? David Zinsner : Yes, sure. I can take a crack at it. So industrial, I would say, sequentially is probably going to be up in the low single digits. Automotive is likely to be down in the low single digits. I'd point out that that's probably better than what they normally see seasonally given we have July in our quarter, and that tends to be a soft month for the automotive market. And then comms is probably close to mid-single digits, somewhere in that range. I'd say it's pretty consistent with where we thought we would be a few months ago. Nothing has changed. The macro is hanging in there nicely. The order flow in all 3 of these markets has been pretty good. We're obviously always running the business cautiously in the event that something in the macro gives us a hiccup. But that hasn't happened, and we're, I guess, pleasantly surprised or happy that that's how things panned out for us. And so hopefully, this continues. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano : This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question. Has there been any more progress in getting your force touch technology adopted at OEMs, either within mobile or in other end markets? I guess, in general, what's your plan going forward with this technology? Vincent Roche : Well, that product source is based on a core technology that we use in multiple applications, in industrial, automotive and so on and so forth. So it's not a case -- the product sector is specific to one application, but the technology is usable in many, many different applications. It's based on our precision signal processing expertise that we've been developing for decades. So as I said, we're, all the time, looking to diversify, be it consumer, be it industrial. But whichever sector, all those products are based upon the core high-performance precision signal processing platform that we've been developing for decades. Ali Husain : Yes. And Vince, just as a point, we don't comment on individual customers or products. So appreciate the question, but we'll move on to the next caller. Operator : Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : You gave great color on the wireless side of your comms business. Can you just give us a similar update on what you're seeing on the wireline side and maybe remind us what the split between those 2 portions of your comms business end up being these days? David Zinsner : Yes. So 2/3 of our business is wireless, and then the other 1/3 is wired. There's several applications within wired, but probably, the most prominent is control that goes into the optical signal. Obviously, that market is doing quite well because there's a move towards 100G, and that's obviously beneficial to us. So it's been on a pretty steady -- the good news on this one is it hasn't had the lumpiness that the wireless business has had. So it's been on a pretty steady growth trajectory. It moves around based on seasonality, but year to year, it's been pretty steady and solid. Vincent Roche : Yes, we've been successful at moving between the various generations of optical transceivers from 2.5 gig right up to 100 gig now and beyond. So we've built a nice franchise, again, based on our signal -- our precision signal processing portfolio, where we're providing sophisticated and very, very precise control of the optical signal chain. So that's the primary part, as Dave said, of our wireline business. Other aspects in which we have a good position are in the data packs and control pads in cable infrastructure. But by far, wireline is dominated by the optical technology that we -- the optical products that we provide. Operator : Your next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Romit Shah : I just wanted to talk about consumer. My understanding is January '15 was the last quarter before you guys started booking force touch revenues, and in that quarter, consumer was about $95 million. This last quarter, consumer was down to $80 million, so it implies that the business overall was down about 16% from that Jan '15 baseline. And I guess excluding force touch, your legacy consumer business was down even more than that. And so I was hoping you guys could talk about the performance of that business and legacy consumer, in particular, and your expectations going forward. Vincent Roche : Yes. Legacy consumer has been for -- it's a huge number of different applications. We have a steady strong business in areas like high-end digital consumer for home and for enterprise, and that's been doing well and continues to do well. It's a very, very modest investment for the company. So my sense is that's been growing at kind of the low single digits for many, many years. My expectation, again, given that it looks a lot like our B2B business in terms of design cycles, product cycles, that will continue to be a modest growth story for ADI in the years ahead. And it leverages. We do very, very little specific product development for that sector. In terms of the remainder of the business, it's lumpier by nature. And we have a good -- as best we can tell, we read the signals pretty well, and we're managing supply and demand on the basis of what we're reading in those more volatile portable consumer applications. Romit Shah : I appreciate the comments. I just -- I don't know that I'm coming away with a clear understanding for why the legacy business has contracted this much over what's been, what, 5 or 6 periods. David Zinsner : Yes. Well, it's been -- it has been a headwind for 6 years or so, 6 or 7 years ago mainly because of the digital still camera business, which has been kind of a -- obviously, everybody's using their phones to take most of their pictures, and so that business has kind of -- has waned a bit. It's down at this point now as we sit in 2016, a pretty nominal level at this point, and so I wouldn't anticipate it being much of a headwind going forward. There is a certain amount of people that will always buy digital SLR cameras. I'm looking over at Ali because he's one of them. So I think at this point now, it's probably stabilized. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee. Douglas Freedman : If I could ask a question regarding the consumer business as well. When we look at sort of the business coming back in, with handsets contributing materially here, how do we think about the incremental margin, both up, but as well as when it ramps down, especially given the actions you seem to be taking as far as managing the factory, which may be not coincident with the ramp-up that you're going to see in revenues? David Zinsner : Yes. So all of this product gets manufactured in a foundry, a third-party foundry, so it doesn't necessarily affect utilization levels. So really, it comes down to what we price the product at and what we pay the foundry and the back end to produce the parts. And the margins are respectable margins, and there's a little bit of a mix degradation by having that business, but it's not significant. I think it runs in the tens of basis points up or down based on whether we have it in a quarter or we have a meaningful amount in a quarter or not a meaningful amount in a quarter. But other than that, I don't -- wouldn't suspect we have much volatility in gross margins from it. Douglas Freedman : I guess another way, Dave, just to ask the question, if we were to exclude the impact of this business year-on-year, would you expect gross margins to be up next year? David Zinsner : Excluding consumer, would we expect gross margins to be up? Douglas Freedman : Yes, yes. Excluding impact of the consumer ramp-up and ramp-down, would I expect to see some gross margin improvement year-on-year? David Zinsner : Yes, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Philip Lee : This is Philip Lee calling on behalf of Chris. You guys mentioned just the inventory was down to 7 weeks this quarter. How is this versus maybe last year? And how do you expect it to turn the rest of the year? David Zinsner : Yes. Typically, the second quarter tends to be a trough of just the inventory levels just because it tends to be a really big quarter for ship-outs. And we're kind of, on a shipment basis, kind of running it pretty consistently. So I wouldn't glean too much from it other than the fact that it's at a healthy level. Seven weeks is exactly where it should be in the second quarter, and that's very healthy. My guess is that in the third quarter, it will start to trend back up to 7.5 weeks and then kind of stabilize until next year's second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : On the strength in industrial, you mentioned aerospace and defense as an area of particular strength. Was this segment up year-over-year? And was it more commercial or defense-related programs that are driving the strength? I know that there are some programs both in commercial satellite and radar. There's also some defense program initiatives like some fighter jet upgrades and so on. And what's the program pipeline look like for the remainder of the year? David Zinsner : Okay. I'll take a little bit of a crack at that, and anybody can join in. It was up year-over-year in the second quarter. It likely will be up year-over-year for the full year unless something changes significantly. Most of the growth that we've seen has been in high-performance RF specific to military applications. We've got a lot of that technology, obviously, when we acquired Hittite. They were already servicing that market in a relatively meaningful way. And their design wins over several years ago are starting to translate into revenue, and that's obviously driven the growth in that business. The expectation over the next 3 to 5 years is quite positive. I think the areas that -- where radar applications are deployed are areas where the military is spending more in. And so as a result, that, coupled with the fact that now we have a really commanding position in that marketplace, leads us to assume that this market for us is going to be a nice driver of growth over the next 3 to 5 years. Vincent Roche : Commercial aircraft is another space where more and more of our technology is being used for all different kinds of signal processing, radio upgrades, control and so on and so forth. And also, satellite, commercial satellite, is an area that's becoming more and more dominant, if you like, particularly for commercial application. So I think overall, when you look at what's been happening and what will happen, that aerospace and defense business will continue to grow for the company at good rates. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : Perhaps, for you, Dave. You were successful in the past in finding tax-efficient ways to use overseas cash for M&A. And I was wondering if you would describe the M&A environment today as being a target-rich one? And of the targets that you're looking at, is there a good potential to use overseas cash tax-efficiently like you have in the past? David Zinsner : Good question. Well, I mean, there are lots of ideas in the pipeline. It goes through a number of stage gates. And as it gets closer and closer to the point in which we're going to pull the trigger on it, those bars are -- get higher and more difficult to get through. So I think that from an ADI perspective, I don't think anything's changed in terms of whether you'll see us do a ton of acquisitions on a very frequent basis. I just don't think that's our model. But there are areas that we think make a lot of sense in terms of acquisitions, and those are the areas we're focused on. And so I suspect we will be doing them from time to time to help augment what we're doing organically. From an acquisition -- from a tax perspective, it's always fact specific as to whether -- which cash we can use depends on where it's located and where their operations are and so forth. But to the extent that it checks all the boxes, I'm sure we could do something similar to what we did with Hittite. Operator : Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing : I had a question on Hittite. I mean, what was the magnitude of the last-time buys in the April quarter? What are the expectations in subsequent quarters? And as customers start looking at developing 5G infrastructure, are there some opportunities here for Hittite and microwave products? I know largely, microwave is for backhaul at the moment and communications. David Zinsner : Yes, Hittite will help us a lot in the 5G space. And given our strong position in 4G and our strong relationship with all the OEMs who are developing 5G applications, we think we're in a great position to really take a commanding position in the 5G space. On the -- I don't have the number off the top of my head, unless you know it, Ali, off the top of your head. But second quarter represented the peak amount of builds that we were going to have associated with Hittite. And so as quarters progress now, it should slowly be coming down. I'm going to guess it added somewhere between 7 and 10 days to our inventory levels because of those transitions. As I said, you'll see a kind of a steady improvement. The one thing is we built up a lot of inventory for stuff that has long life cycles, and so it will take some time for us to get all the way down to 0. It might take 5 years, maybe even 7 years to get down to 0. But the good news is that the headwind aspect of the inventory build is behind us and now it becomes a tailwind going forward. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : A question on the communications wireless business. I was wondering -- just given some of the comments around small cells, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your revenue sensitivity to deployments regarding small cells versus base stations just given the different levels of content and also the unit deployments. And also if you have any further visibility into -- beyond the current quarter regarding CapEx for either small cells or macro base stations. Vincent Roche : I think we're in a very good position in both macro cells and small cells. As more and more of the usage of cellular equipment is in building, there may be a switch to small cells over time, but it's not going to be a growth switch from macro to small. I think there's always going to be a mix of both. So we're very well positioned irrespective of whether our customers are deploying macro or small cells. And in terms of content, obviously, the small cell has less content than the large cell. But we have -- in terms of the radio, we've got almost the entire radio in the small cell given the strength of our software-defined transceiver technologies. So I think what you'll see is the deployment will continue on the macro side. There will be an upsurge in small cell over the remainder of this year into next year. And we're very well positioned irrespective of whether it's macro or small. What was the second part of the question? David Zinsner : CapEx. Vincent Roche : CapEx. I think the way to look at the CapEx discussion is in -- terms of innovation, the innovation in base stations is really happening at the radio level to increase spectral efficiency and flexibility. So there's an increasing amount of the hardware spend going into the radio over time. And with the strength that we have in the franchise, we've got in terms of mix signal and RF and microwave technologies, I think we're very well positioned given the strength of our relationships and the fact that we've skewed R&D over the last 5 years more heavily towards wireless applications. Irrespective of what happens, I believe it will be a fairly stable CapEx environment in terms of the ratio of services, software and hardware. But I think we're well positioned as a company to grab additional share there given, as I said, the strength of our technology and customer positions. Operator : Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I just had a couple of follow-ups. Just on the A&D strength, is this more primarily Hittite benefiting from your channel? Or is it more a result of the last-time buys? And then a little bit longer term, when do we expect to see jointly developed products between Hittite and ADI? And I realize it takes a while for that to pan out. And then a second quick follow-up. Dave, you mentioned that in consumer, you'll have more content. Is that because you're -- because I can't imagine ASP going up. Are you designing out sockets from -- that somebody else had? David Zinsner : That's a lot of questions, Ambrish. Okay. So on the aerospace and defense side, I would say -- I would characterize the growth as products designed back in the Hittite days in a lot of cases, some on our own products, back many years ago, that now -- because it takes a while for that stuff to turn around and become revenue. And so that's really what's driven the performance at this point. It hasn't been related to Hittite being a part of ADI yet. The opportunity pipeline has significantly expanded because of the acquisition of Hittite and because of our ability to both sell more of what Hittite sells or makes into that market and also what we make and try to drive that into that market. And so I think that we'll start to see some revenue synergies next year and probably be relatively modest next year but begin to ramp significantly over time. And it's probably on the opportunity side of peak revenues. It's probably $100 million of opportunity. So not all of that we'll close on, but it's a significant amount of synergies that we were able to get by combining Hittite and Analog Devices. Vincent Roche : Yes. In terms of your product development question, the combination of Hittite, maybe on the design side of things, we acquired the technology to enable us to broadly apply microwave technology and build a real leadership franchise in the high end of communications infrastructure, general communications, even industrial instrumentation. So we already have very, very good synergy between the design teams in looking at the next 5G application -- in the 5G application, the next generation of Advanced Driver Assistance, where there's a lot of microwave technology needed. So we'll start to see the first combined products hit the market over the coming year. And beyond there, I think you'll see more complete solutions from ADI, the combination of the old ADI and Hittite together, in many, many different markets. David Zinsner : Okay. So then on the consumer side, we can't comment specifically on whether or not we're displacing somebody and, if so, who. But I can tell you that we have more sockets in the next generation than we did in the last generation, and that's what's driving the BOM to be higher at this time. Ali Husain : And Ambrish, just a slight housekeeping note from me. When you talked about the last-time buys, those are last-time buys that we made on foundry. So that didn't impact the revenues, really, in the aerospace and defense side. Okay. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : One more quick follow-up on consumer. You said that the ramp was going to happen late in Q3, which seemingly would imply potentially a fairly big Q4 sequential ramp as you annualize that. Can you give us some feeling for what the trajectory of that consumer business into Q4 ought to look like? And do you think that it could be -- would it be up or would it be down year-over-year versus last year? Because I think Q4 of last year was the peak. David Zinsner : Yes. Definitely hard to predict exactly how the trajectory is going to work out. But I would say it's going to be -- you could -- if we end up shipping in the last, say, 2 or 3 weeks of July, we're going to probably be shipping at that level through the entire fourth quarter, so you can interpret that what you want. But it's going to be a meaningful ramp in the consumer space in the fourth quarter, at least, as things have lined up so far. On a year-over-year basis, I think given the fact that there was probably -- or shipped in -- and I think we can safely say in the fourth quarter versus what was consumed, and that drove a lot of inventory in the channel. I think on a year-over-year basis, we're likely to be down in the consumer space. But I think from a sequential basis, it'll look quite nice. Stacy Rasgon : And so just to clarify, so we're talking something like a $30 million sequential increase in Q3, all of which may be happening potentially in the last couple of weeks. So, I mean, if we're annualizing that for 3 months in the following quarter, if you're shipping at that rate, I mean, this could be -- you were talking something like $100 million, maybe even more, sequentially into Q4 that we could see in terms of increase. Is that the right way to think about that? David Zinsner : Yes. It's obviously tough to predict, but you're probably in the zip code at this point. Ali Husain : And by the way, if that did happen, as Dave mentioned, I think, in the prepared remarks, the operating margin leverage we expect to see in the fourth quarter would be pretty strong. Operator : Your next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Just staying on the topic of consumer and for both Dave and Vince. Investors have been somewhat critical about your exposure here over the last 2 or 3 quarters because it tends to be volatile, tends to be commoditized. We always worry about how long you can hold on to the business. And you guys have done sort of a great job talking about the trajectory for this fiscal year, and when you initially got this business, I think you talked about 2 years of visibility. I'm wondering if you could just talk, longer term, how we should think about the consumer bucket. And Dave, you've talked about in the past your need just to be strategically engaged with certain customers to broaden out your footprint. Maybe you can talk about your ability to have broadened out that footprint with this customer as we go into fiscal '17. David Zinsner : Yes. So obviously, they don't give us a ton of visibility, but next year, as much as we can tell, looks to be in pretty good shape for 2017 for this customer. And as I said, we actually got more sockets this time around and held the prior socket, all of which are high-performance parts that -- and that's really what we're trying to focus on with that customer or with any customer, quite honestly, not only in the consumer space but outside of the customer space in the B2B markets. And that's -- we're going to maintain that strategy going forward. And I think there is enough to win at that customer and in the consumer space to drive growth in the consumer business. And as you point out, longer term -- and it's not even just this particular customer, but there are a handful of customers that have -- certainly have consumer exposure but that are more broadly focused in other markets because a lot of this stuff is converging. And so we want to be attached to those customers as they think up new ideas, that we can come up with new technologies to help define their parts and make them better, and that's what we're going to do. And so that's where we direct our research and development dollars. It's worked out for us here, and my guess is there'll be other things that we do for this customer and other customers in other markets that will help them and help us. Vincent Roche : The user experience becomes more and more sophisticated in these applications. That's in our wheelhouse. We play on the edge of the physical and the digital, so it gives us more opportunity. But as Dave pointed out, we're looking for the really hard-to-solve problems in these applications, where we can hopefully get multiple generations' worth of momentum and where we can get the kind of margin performance ratio that we expect. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Just, Vince, longer term, is the current top line growth rate acceptable to you? And if it is not, do you think it's time to consider larger and more transformative acquisitions? And how do you think about the -- whether it's the accretion metrics or anything else that we should keep in mind because the macro environment has stayed somewhat sluggish, and you have managed to navigate through that quite well. But I'm just curious whether -- even with this navigation, is the top line growth acceptable to you? And if not, what can you do about it? Vincent Roche : Well, we've said publicly that we are committed to generating over $4 of EPS by 2020. We remain committed to that. And when we first offered that target to the investor community back in '14, we said that we expected our revenue, our top line to grow at the rate of 2 to 3x GDP, whatever that is, and we remain optimistic about that. We're investing at a level in terms of R&D and field -- customer engagement that -- and given what we see in terms of the design activity, the customer engagement activity, we remain committed to that top line target. Another component of, obviously, being able to get towards that EPS target over time is to do careful M&A. And so that is the mix, and we are committed to our targets. We believe in the growth story. And as I said, we will use our balance sheet wisely to get some more high-performance technology that will enable the company to grow at an even greater rate over time. David Zinsner : And as far as just the acquisition measures, we use -- there's probably 15 of them that we use. Obviously, accretion plays a factor in it. We look at kind of the relative valuations of the cash flow of the business that we're looking at to determine whether we're paying a good price for it. We want businesses that grow and that help us drive our growth faster than we are growing today. So that's a key component, and we believe that, that can happen. And obviously, we think we're looking for things where we can get synergies. Sometimes, that's cost. Sometimes, it's cost and revenue. And so those are things that kind of influence us. Sometimes, when we're doing tuck-ins like SNAP Sensor, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, there isn't much in terms of financials to hang your hat on in the early stages. And so then it really comes down to whether or not the technology really was going to make a difference in our customer's application and ultimately, the user experience. And that tends to rule the day when it comes to those tuck-ins. Vivek Arya : Is there any push from customers to have more integrated solutions? That's where I was coming from, that if you are the leader in converters, does it help to gain access to other areas because that's what your customers might be asking you to do? David Zinsner : Yes, it's integrating all the time. We're developing -- we're moving more and more to a systems level solution. And so that requires us to have more and more technology, some of which we do acquire, a lot of which we actually build internally. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think what we acquire depends very much on the type of segment we're addressing. The reason we bought SNAP Sensor was to help us move up the stack, to make our solution more complete. We've got a very strong DSP, high-performance signal processing technology platform and product base, onto which we needed to add some algorithmic value in that particular imaging application. So yes, what we acquire and what customers are asking us to do very much is application and market segment-dependent. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie : So last quarter, you mentioned that orders are positive but that you felt that your customers were a little bit worried about the overall weaker macro. Have you seen any changes in their general outlook since the last call? David Zinsner : No, I think they're pretty much the same. They're cautiously optimistic. The macro has held in there. The order flow has been good. Customers think they're going to -- I think, in aggregate, think they're going to see modest growth this year. But they're obviously very cautious. They're keeping their inventory levels lean. We see that, obviously, at the disti level as well. So that's -- I think it's pretty consistent through the whole year, really. Operator : And your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Dave, one follow-up to a question you asked -- or answered earlier on the gross margin side. I know you said you're taking utilization down by roughly 10% sequentially in the third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about why you're doing that, considering that you said that the comms business is in the early stages of recovery? You're now past the headwinds on the auto side, where you had the design loss on the passive safety, et cetera. If everything in your core is starting to grow year-over-year, what led you to the decision to cut utilization that substantially? David Zinsner : I mean, I don't know that it's significant, but we had 138 days of inventory, and we want to get that level down. And we felt like we should address it now rather than wait. I would -- like I said in the prior question -- or answer to the prior question, I think a lot of the inventory is related to product that was manufactured in foundry. But nevertheless, we got to work all of the levers to get the inventories to where we want them to be, and this seemed like an appropriate place to pull it down. The comms one doesn't influence us a ton because there isn't much of that, that gets done in internal foundries or internal fabs. Really, it's in the industrial space, which is -- kind of plugging along at kind of a low growth rate at this point. So it seemed like we weren't taking a big risk by adjusting the production there. I would say that I think it's a 1-quarter event. When you take down inventory levels and you take down the utilization rates, generally, you shut the factory down. And so we'll be taking, I think, on average, 2 weeks to shut down in our internal fabs. I would suspect that we will be back to not doing that in the fourth quarter, and so utilization should come back up again in the fourth quarter. Ross Seymore : Great. One other housekeeping one. You were gracious enough to say your content is going up with a specific customer. Relative to what you had in the prior generation, is the content increase, just order of magnitude, a similar amount to the prior socket, half, double? Any sort of color directionally would be helpful. David Zinsner : Yes, I probably have to avoid these kind of pricing things. It's not to the level of the prior socket. Let's put it that way. Ali Husain : Okay, great. Well, it looks like Ross was our last question, so we'll close out the call. As a reminder, our third quarter 2016 results will be issued on August 17 at 8 a.m., similar to this quarter, and we'll have the earnings call at 10 a.m. So that does it for us here. Thanks for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you soon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Analog Devices Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain : All right. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the Analog Devices Third Quarter FY '16 Earnings Conference Call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and our investor toolkit, which includes additional information that we believe will be useful for investors, you can find that at investor.analog.com. As usual, I'm joined by ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. And so before we start, let's get through some disclosures. Please note, the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in today's earnings release, which we've posted at investor.analog.com. And so with that, let's get started.  So revenue in the third quarter totaled $870 million and exceeded our revised guidance. Revenue increased 12% sequentially and increased 1% from the prior year. Our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure in the aggregate were slightly down sequentially, but grew 4% over the prior year. Now let's talk about our results by end market. The highly diverse industrial market represented 43% of revenue in the third quarter. All industrial subsectors were stable to up sequentially, in line with expectations. But the timing of customer orders in the aerospace and defense vertical led to a weaker-than-anticipated performance in this sector in the quarter. The automotive market at 15% of revenue decreased 2% sequentially in the seasonally slower July quarter, but importantly, returned to year-over-year growth, increasing 3%. We believe the headwinds from the passive safety market have largely abated. And we're, in fact, very excited about our prospects for automotive revenue growth going forward.  Turning now to the communications infrastructure market. At 20% of revenue, sales to our hundreds of communications infrastructure customers were stable sequentially and grew 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireless infrastructure decreased, while wireline infrastructure applications revenue increased as customers continue to build out metro and inter-data center network infrastructure for 100-gig and 100-gig-plus optical networking.  Turning now to the consumer market. The consumer market typically drives significant ROI and free cash flow for ADI. And this market represented 21% of total sales in the quarter, increasing 131% sequentially. The strong sequential performance was due to better-than-anticipated portable consumer application revenue.  So now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal '16. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Dave's comments on our third quarter P&L line items will exclude special items, which, in the aggregate, totaled $28 million for the quarter. When comparing our third quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release. So with that, Dave, I'll turn it over to you. David Zinsner : Thanks, Ali, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was a very good quarter for ADI, with revenue increasing to $870 million and diluted earnings per share growing to $0.82, with both results exceeding our revised guidance. Gross margin of 66% increased 20 basis points from the prior quarter as cost savings and lower spend in the fabs offset lower utilization rates and mix. Inventory, on a dollars basis, decreased $7 million sequentially and, on a days basis, decreased 16 days to 122 days. We're now expecting days of inventory to decline further in the fourth quarter and to be in the range of 110 to 115 days, in line with our model.  Inventory and distribution channel on a dollars basis was modestly higher than in the prior quarter and, on a weeks basis, remained at 7 weeks, consistent with the prior quarter.  Operating expenses increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 12% sequential increase in revenue, as we continue to manage our expenses very tightly and gain operating leverage in our financial model. As a result, operating profit before tax of $296 million increased 24% sequentially. And as a percent of sales, operating profit before tax expanded 330 basis points to 34.1%.  Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $12 million. Given our recently announced acquisition of Linear Tech and related financing costs, we expect that our net interest expense will be approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that quarterly run rate until we close the transaction.  Our third quarter tax rate was approximately 10% as we adjusted our full year tax rate down slightly to 12%. Excluding special items, our business delivered strong operating leverage, with diluted earnings per share of $0.82 increasing 28% sequentially on a 12% increase in revenue. Diluted EPS increased 6% over the prior year.  At the end of the third quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.8 billion, with $860 million available domestically. We had approximately $1.8 billion in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2 billion.  Our business strategy and consistent financial execution enable strong free cash flow generation, which supports investments in our business and the return of cash to shareholders. Excluding a onetime item, over the past 12 months, ADI has generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, effectively converting each dollar of revenue into $0.32 of free cash flow, at the very high end of our free cash flow model range. In the third quarter alone, free cash flow margins expanded 600 basis points as compared to the prior year.  In terms of cash returns to shareholders, over the past 12 months, we have returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which represents a 90% free cash flow payout.  I want to now take a minute to talk about our capital allocation philosophy in light of the recently announced Linear Tech acquisition. As we mentioned when we announced the deal, the combined companies' pro forma free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis ending April 2016 would have increased from $1 billion to $1.7 billion. After the deal closes, we plan to use our combined cash generation to rapidly pay down the debt associated with the transaction. As a result, we anticipate our net debt to EBITDA to go from 3.8x at deal close to approximately 2x net debt to EBITDA within 3 years of the transaction closing, which translates into an approximate $1 billion per year expected debt paydown schedule. In order to facilitate this rapid deleveraging, we have suspended our share repurchase program. That said, the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation philosophy, and we intend to maintain our dividend policy.  So in summary, this was a solid quarter on several fronts. We executed well in our business. And the diversity of our customers, applications and markets, coupled with the sustainability of our innovation, enabled both revenue and diluted earnings per share to exceed our revised guidance. We're also very excited about the acquisition of Linear Tech, which we announced during the quarter. And I'll invite Vince to come on and say a few words in a minute.  Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today's release. We're planning for another quarter of sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, we are planning for aggregate demand to remain stable sequentially and, on a year-over-year basis, to increase in the low to mid-single digits.  In the consumer market, strong customer demand and increasing dollar content in portable applications leads us to plan for continued sequential growth in this market. In total, we're planning for revenue in the fourth quarter to grow sequentially and be in the range of $910 million to $970 million. We expect factory utilization in the fourth quarter to be similar to its third quarter level as we manage our days of inventory. And so we are planning for gross margins in the fourth quarter to decrease approximately 50 basis points to 65.5% on the expected mix of business.  We are planning for operating expenses in the fourth quarter to increase slightly sequentially but to significantly lag our expected sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter and for operating margins to expand from their third quarter levels. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94.  Now before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to invite Vince to say a few words about the recently announced Linear Tech combination. Vince? Vincent Roche : Great. Thanks, Dave. Well, as you know, late last month, we announced an agreement to acquire Linear Technology Corporation. This is a transformative acquisition that brings together the 2 best franchises in the analog industry and, once we combine our highly complementary portfolios, will make us a market leader across all major analog product categories.  Following last month's announcement, I have personally heard from many customers, from employees and shareholders, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are excited to gain access to a comprehensive portfolio of the best brands in high-performance analog, the industry's best design engineers and FAE support and the best-in-class supply chain all under one roof and with our continued commitment to the long-term support of our customers. Our employees as well are very excited by the opportunities created by combining our 2 complementary suites of high-performance analog products and technologies. Beyond that, both companies have long admired the technical expertise and acumen of the other. And our teams are looking forward to the collaboration and innovation possibilities when combining 2 of the best engineering teams on the planet.  ADI and Linear are 2 amazing companies with very storied histories and vibrant cultures, and we plan to take the best of both companies to create something much greater than the sum of the parts. We have many ties that bind us. We both believe that innovation and the passion for our customer success drive superior business results. And we share an intense focus on operational excellence across quality, reliability, supply chain and, of course, financial returns.  As a result of this combination, our financial profile is expected to be among the best in the industry with strong margins and free cash flow, which we expect will increase over time as we realize the financial synergies and cross-selling opportunities inherent in this transaction. And as Dave mentioned, ADI's anticipated free cash flow generation is expected to increase significantly from current levels.  We believe that this combination is good for all of our stakeholders. For customers, it will create a true innovation and support partner that is unmatched in the industry. For employees, it will create a tremendous opportunity for professional growth and the ability to help redefine an industry. And for shareholders, this acquisition will further diversify our end-market exposure and strengthen our business and financial profile. Notably, we expect this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow and anticipate non-GAAP EPS accretion of 10% right out of the gates.  There is no other team of people out there who could accomplish what we believe Analog and Linear will accomplish together. And I'm very excited to get started on the next phase of our journey together. And so with that, we'll now start taking your questions. Ali Husain : All right. Great. Thanks, Vince. [Operator Instructions] So we plan to run the call until 11 :00, and so I think that's plenty of time to get to everyone's questions. So with that, operator, let's start the Q&A session. Folks on the line can ask questions to either myself, Vince or Dave. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : I had a quick clarification and then my question. Clarification. Dave, you mentioned on the dividend policy, you have been raising dividend consistently for as long as I can remember. You did mean to imply that you would be raising dividend consistently like you have in the past. And then my question on autos. Good to see the headwind from MEMS kind of abating. What are the areas that you are excited about as you alluded to that you should expect to see growth in that segment? David Zinsner : Okay. I'll take the dividend question, and I'll let Vince comment on the areas of automotive that we're excited about. On the dividend policy, as you know, our model is to grow our dividend over time at a rate of 5% to 10%, and that continues to be our model. Vincent Roche : Yes. So okay, on the automotive side, we play in 3, I would say, premier spaces where innovation really matters. We play in powertrain. And there, for example, we have new sensor technology. We have an ongoing stream of growth in the battery management area. And we have new modality switches, AMR, for example, managing -- or measuring very, very accurately, sensing -- measuring torque, for example, which is an important modality in the car. Also, our audio infotainment solutions are becoming more and more adopted across many, many platforms across the OEMs in the global market. Now for example, recently, we saw that -- you probably saw Ford announce our -- we've talked to you before about this A2B bus, a very, very efficient, high-integrity bus that's being used in the car to move media -- audio media. Ford just announced, with our brand, the inclusion of that technology in 2 of their particular car models. We have talked before as well about the growth of ADAS. We have a very strong position in 24-gigahertz radar solutions, microwave to bits. And we're starting to move with some very attractive solutions as well in the 77-gigahertz radar area. So I think we have a good spread of technologies across the various car platforms, using our underlying strength in sensing, measuring and interpreting in both the precision signal processing area as well as the very, very high-speed signal processing area. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Vince, and thanks, Ambrish, for the question. I think, Ambrish, you do highlight a good point, which is if you actually look at our automotive business, excluding the passive safety area, we've actually grown that business in the high single digits year-over-year in the quarter. And I think that really speaks to the additional content that we're getting into vehicles now, as Vince mentioned, and that we're really excited about going forward as well. So thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : So my question is on the consumer business, so up 130% sequentially. Can you just talk about the dynamics there, how we should think about that business here in the back half of the year? Clearly, a very volatile business. But yes, if there's anything you can add on the actual trends in the second half, that'd be great. David Zinsner : So Tore, you mean trends in terms of how it's going to do next quarter, you mean? Tore Svanberg : Well, just obviously, 130% is not the actual rate growth of that business. So how should we think about the volatility? David Zinsner : Yes. I would say in the fourth quarter, it's certainly going to be up again. That's going to be the driver of the sequential growth, probably in high-20s, low-30s percent sequentially. Then the next quarter -- last year, we declined about 60%, I think, sequentially, but that was -- partially, it's due obviously to seasonality. And then the other part of it is that there was a build of inventory last year at the end of fourth quarter, and we had that kind of consumption of that inventory in the channel that affected demand for us. This year, I think we have a closer linkage between supply and demand here on the consumer side. And so I would expect us to decline seasonally in the first quarter but only seasonally. I don't think we would have this kind of ramp-down due to over-inventory -- overbuild in the inventory side of things in the supply chain. So it's probably going to be roughly half the rate of what we saw last year sequentially. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think the way to look at this market overall, Tore, we take a long-term view to the consumer market, like we do to all the markets in which we participate. So we're picking out -- with our customers, we're picking the hardest problems to solve. We're pointing our technology at these problems, and we look for areas where we can get sustainability from generation to generation. So we take a long-term view, and then the market will do what the market does in terms of gyration. But I think in the areas that we're playing, we're executing well, and we've got some very, very exciting technologies in the pipeline as well for the future here. Ali Husain : Yes, great. Thanks, Tore. That was a great question. And then I'd just point out, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that business for ADI drives a very strong ROI, a very strong free cash flow business for the company. And if you note that certainly consumer grew 131% or so sequentially, the operating margins for the company also expanded -- for the entire company, expanded well over 300 basis points as a result. So a great business to be in if you pick your spot. Operator : Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra : Just a quick follow-up on the consumer question. You've talked about some content increase. Can you quantify this sort of a mid-single-digit content increase relative to what you had last year? David Zinsner : It's about 30%. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : As you work towards the Linear Tech deal, can you just give us an update on just the Hittite integration, kind of how it's going versus initial expectations a couple of years ago, and then also just from a cross-selling perspective, how that's performed and the opportunities that you have? David Zinsner : Okay. So I'll talk about it from an operational standpoint, and then Vince can talk big picture about how it's gone. Just operationally, I would say we're pretty much fully integrated. We had expectations to get synergies that would drive the kind of accretion up into the kind of high teens. And that actually -- we've actually been successful with that. In fact, we're actually a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be from an expense perspective. From a revenue pipeline perspective, we have seen a lot of activity in terms of design-ins, in some case, design wins where we have been either able to take products that Hittite sold and bring them into our customer base or actually vice versa. For example, in the case of the military business, they have actually been able to bring ADI parts into their customer base. And that's going quite well. I would say that's exceeding our expectations. I wouldn't say that it's shown up significantly on the revenue line just yet, nor do we expect it to. This is -- these are markets that have long design levels. But from everything we can tell, just looking at how the activity has transpired from the time we closed until to where we are today, we think we're ahead of where we thought we would be. I don't know if you have anything to add. Vincent Roche : Yes, that's good color, Dave. I think we're approaching the LTC combination very much as we did with Hittite. We -- I think with both Hittite and LTC, we share the same values essentially. We're very innovation-centered with very, very high standards in terms of how we execute in supply chain, quality and financial returns. And that's not negotiable. That's what we strive for in these combinations. Obviously, the cultures are different, but I view the cultural diversity as an opportunity to improve both companies. There -- when you get world-class companies who have been doing things very, very well as they were independently, you have got to listen very, very carefully to and understand what each side has been doing and do your best to combine the entities to create something greater than the sum of the parts. We did that with Hittite. We -- and that's the approach we're taking as well with LTC. And when I look at the combination of Hittite with ADI, for example, with our customers in communications infrastructure, broad-based communications activity, in the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense areas, it's really exciting to see how we're now solving big problems from end to end. We are -- we've got unique capabilities. I think we are probably the only high-performance microwave-to-bit supplier out there that can run the gamut of technologies and solve big-footprint radio problems for our customers. So I think, obviously, with LTC, we get the real strength that they bring in the power area and some in the mixed signal areas and in the little niches. So my sense is we will take the very same approach as we did with Hittite. We've learned a lot as well through the process. And we will, as I said, listen very, very carefully to making sure that we understand the best practices and that we use them across technology, product development, supply chain, quality and customer support, of course. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : So if we incorporate your guidance for the individual product segments for the fiscal Q4 for fiscal '16, I think comm, industrial and auto are all essentially flat. So what sort of growth would we expect for those 3 segments? And you can just do relative, if you want, for fiscal '17. And then how much would consumer be up -- would be expected to be up for fiscal '17? David Zinsner : Difficult to say at this point how all this stuff is going to transpire. We actually haven't done our plan -- our annual operating plan for 2017 yet, which is due to happen in the next couple of months. I would say that our expectation is that the industrial market grows normally in kind of the mid-single digits, kind of GDP plus a little. So I think that's kind of how we're building it. Whether that happens in '17 probably has more to do with how the macro does than anything. But I think it's a good rule of thumb to think about that growing in those kind of rates. Automotive, I think, over time, should be back into the levels that Ali talked about at the subsegments, which is to grow in the high single digits. It's been weighed down a bit, obviously, by this passive safety business kind of coming off. And -- but that's kind of running its course. It's ceased to be that the driver for automotive is to stay flat. It's still going to be a little bit of a headwind, although a smaller headwind into next year. But I think automotive has a chance to start to move. I think it grew a few percent or will have grown a few percent this year, probably grows mid-single digits next year and probably goes up to the high single digits the following year given all of the exciting opportunities we have that Vince talked about. In the comms space, it's anybody's guess, I think. Over time, we think that our technology, which is ahead of competitors, will allow us to drive share gains in that market. And so even if the market itself, the CapEx environment or the comm infrastructure market is kind of really low single-digit CapEx increases year-over-year, we think we will grow faster than that because of our position in that marketplace. And then the consumer market, obviously, it was down -- or should be down, most likely, year-over-year this year as we won't have the same inventory build we had last year, which kind of hit us this year. But I think next year has an opportunity to have a pretty decent year because this year was actually weighed down by the fact that they were digesting inventory in the first half of the year. Next year, that won't be the case. On top of that, we'll get the full year effect of the dollar-content improvements in the -- that we got this -- at the end of this year. And so we're cautiously optimistic about the consumer business having a decent year next year. Operator : And your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : So Dave, I was hoping you could just comment on the ends of the outlook range on revenues. Is the gap between the low end and the high end just allowing for a still uncertain macro? Or is it related to allowances in any of the segments for different types of build plan assumptions? And any color on what would swing things to the low end or high end would be greatly appreciated. David Zinsner : Yes. Good question, Craig. A part of it is the fact that consumer tends to have a little bit of uncertainty built in. We come in with quite a bit of backlog. But sometimes that backlog can shift around towards the end of the quarter a little bit, and that can affect the quarter number, even though it doesn't affect kind of the full build plan over time. The other piece was you just have to build a little bit of cushion in for kind of a macro uncertainty that might hit us at some point. We don't expect that, which is why kind of the middle of the range is a pretty decent increase. But we did build in some cushion, just in case something kind of surprised us. But I would tell you that we come in, in a very good position from a backlog perspective. And so although we gave a wide range, we feel pretty good about them hitting the middle part of that range. And if things go better than that, we could hit the higher end of the range. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani : So just a question on the industrial side. Sounds like part of the year-over-year decline was driven by this aerospace and defense orders getting pushed out and the timing getting pushed out. Could you just talk about what sort of revenue did you end up missing in July quarter because of that? And is it logical to assume that you'd pick this back up in the October quarter and you could see better growth in the industrial segment in that case? David Zinsner : Yes. So the industrial weakness was really -- as Ali actually mentioned, it was really specific to the aerospace and defense. That's programmatic. Sometimes in certain particular quarters, they may not take as much as we have forecasted just by the timing of the programs. We do expect that to resume in the fourth quarter, come back in the fourth quarter. And that was really the most significant impact. We didn't really expect industrial to have significant improvement sequentially. So it's not altogether surprising that we were down $10 million, but it was in that kind of range that -- where the miss occurred. On the automotive side, I would say we kind of hit where we thought we would. We thought we would be down around 3%. I think we're down sequentially down 2%. So we did, actually, marginally better than we expected in the automotive space. So that's going, I would say, better than expected. Ali Husain : Yes. And let me just give you a little color on the industrial segment, if I can, Amit. I mean, really, everything within the industrial space performed as we'd expected. Everything was stable to slightly up sequentially. Let me give you a little more color then. In North America, we had a good quarter in factory automation. We believe that's driven by stabilization in the oil and gas space. In China, renewable energy did particularly well. And as Dave mentioned, the aerospace and defense area was -- hit a bit of an air pocket this quarter. But I think if you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, that business has actually done very, very well for ADI. And really, the acquisition of Hittite has really, as Vince mentioned earlier, reinvigorated that business for us. We've got a guy who's running that business, who's doing an amazing job with what I think is a pretty expansive portfolio in that area. So we think A&D is actually a growth market for us going forward. And there -- in there, the customers are really looking at these old mechanical systems that are expensive. And they're looking to replace them with higher performance, cheaper silicon solutions, and that really increases our content meaningfully in those systems over time. So I think, looking at any of these markets in a quarter, particularly in lumpy markets, can be fraught with peril. I think, if you take a longer-term view, I think these markets are doing pretty nicely for ADI. So well, appreciate the question. Operator : Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : I guess in the current quarter, and you're mentioning about $10 million offset from the aero, but you had originally guided the B2B business up in the mid- to upper single digits. $10 million differential still wouldn't quite get you there. So I'm wondering what other areas in the quarter were potentially weaker than you thought. And I was also hoping if you could give us a little more color on a segment basis for what you expect for next quarter beyond just the aggregate platform [ph]. David Zinsner : Right. Well, the other area that was a little less than planned was the communications market. It declined about 1%, I think, sequentially. We expected that business to be up this quarter. I would say that was customer-specific. There was one particular customer that did quite a bit weaker than expected. Vincent Roche : On the wireless side. David Zinsner : On the wireless side. And there was some color around India, pushing out some of their infrastructure build-outs that may have contributed to that. That was the other area that surprised us. And then your other part of your question, Stacy, is how I expect the end markets to play out in the fourth quarter. I would think that -- we mentioned B2B was likely to be flat. I think the combination of industrial and auto is likely to be up a bit, and I think communications might be marginally weaker. Operator : Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Dave, you guided interest income up throughout -- until the close of the deal. Could just talk about what debt you're adding and at what interest rate? And does that come off the $7.3 billion that you're planning on raising to acquire Linear? David Zinsner : Yes. It's really just the -- so when we executed the agreement with Linear Tech to purchase Linear, we had to enter into an underwriting commitment with a set of banks to provide -- so that the funding was essentially guaranteed. We haven't drawn any of the money, but banks don't agree to do that without you agreeing to pay them something. So the step-up from what was about $12 million a quarter up to what is going to be around $20 million, give or take, is really that cost of them providing that commitment, even though we haven't borrowed anything. That then goes away once we enter into the agreement with -- or rather, close the deal with Linear Tech. And then there'll be a new financing cost, obviously, which is actually the drawn down amount, which, as I indicated, was going to be around 3% pretax on what will start out being $11 billion but quickly paid down to about $7 billion, $7.5 billion. Operator : Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Just want to ask a question on the communications area. That -- in past calls, you've been pretty bullish about the expectations there. I know you talked about the wireless being weak in both the quarter, and it seems like even in the guide you're talking comms being a little bit weaker. Can you talk about any confidence or what level of confidence you have in that communications segment growing going forward? Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a good question. So we look at the comms infrastructure market, in general, as it's a very important market for ADI. And as always, we take a long-term view to how we invest, how we pick our spots and how we invest there. So we're solving radio problems for our customers, I believe, with the level of completeness that is quite unique. And with the addition of Hittite to our portfolio, we're very well positioned in microwave to bits. And of course, with the addition of the Linear portfolio, we're able to attach the high-performance power products, which will enable us to even offer more complete solutions to our customers. So I think the way to look at this market, whatever happens with the short-term gyrations, the challenges that our customers are facing are really immense. The problems are getting harder and harder from generation to generation. They're trying to solve the ongoing problem, the spectral efficiency, information integrity, power efficiency, and those problems will persist. And we're in a better position than ever to solve these problems. So the markets are going to gyrate. It's very, very hard to predict. It's quite a lumpy business, as we always say. It's hard to predict quarter-to-quarter what's going to happen. But we view the whole comms infrastructure area as really the electricity of the modern economy. And the things that are under our control, how we innovate, how we engage with our customers, we're doing better there than ever. We continue to make improvements and I believe we're poised to take share. So whatever the market does, we're poised to take share as the years move on here. So I think that's the way to view communications infrastructure. Operator : Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : So within your broad-based industrial business, can you just talk about the geographical dimensions you saw in Q3? I know you touched upon some specific product drivers in certain geographies, but maybe just touch upon sort of the broad geographical trends, particularly China since I think your industrial business in China has been a strong driver over the last couple of quarters. And then maybe touch upon what's implied within the fourth quarter industrial guidance, again, from a geographical perspective. Ali Husain : Sure. Good question, Harlan. Let me take that one. Okay, so by region, I'd say North America and Europe were a little bit weaker sequentially. And as I mentioned earlier, even though factory automation was quite strong in North America, our A&D business tends to be more focused in North America. And so as a result of that being weak, North America being a weaker region for us in the industrial space. China was very strong. Again, as you mentioned, it's a key area for us in the industrial space. That was strong on instrumentation applications, Smart City and energy-type applications. Then as I mentioned earlier, in North America, factory automation was pretty strong on stable oil and gas. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, it's actually an interesting question that you posed because, generally speaking, the fourth quarter for industrial tends to be down in the mid-single digits. This time, we're expecting industrial to be pretty stable to the third quarter level. And there's a few reasons for that, why we're feeling, I guess, relatively bullish on that market in the next quarter. The aerospace and defense sector, we expect to come back a little bit in the following quarter. And frankly, if you look at the orders in distribution, they're currently pretty strong. And I think if you compare that to some of the outlooks painted by some of the larger distributors out there, their book-to-bills are trending at parity or above parity, so that would support the strong flows we're seeing in distribution. So as a result, I think when you package up all those disparate points, we come up with a view that next quarter, the industrial market should be pretty stable to its third quarter levels here. So hopefully that answered the question. Operator : Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree : With the Linear acquisition, what are your long-term thoughts on your capacity needs and how that might impact margins? David Zinsner : Well, we'll have 4 fabs on a combined basis, and so we'll have plenty of capacity for the future demand of the business. We've had utilization down this quarter, expected to be down next quarter, probably it'd be down again in the first -- at this level, in the first quarter again. And then it steps up a bit. Their utilization is actually pretty good. So I think that, for the foreseeable future, I think we feel pretty good about what our capacity looks like. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think job #1, when you think about fabs and foundry, job #1 is to make sure that across the huge breadth of SKUs that we've got that are very, very important to, particularly, our industrial and B2B customers, job #1 is to make sure we have no supply chain disruptions whatsoever. We both -- both LTC and ADI have -- we got very, very high scores for being able to supply a huge diversity of products over very, very long periods of time. That's a tremendous value to our customers. So job #1 is to make sure that we don't diminish that value in any way. And as Dave said, we manage utilizations on a dynamic basis to make sure that we match supply and demand, and that will continue to be the way. Ali Husain : Yes, and I think it's worthy of mentioning here. This transaction is to better serve our customers, so let's not lose sight of that. Operator : Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong : Can you give us some idea in the longer run how 5G might affect your content opportunity in comms infrastructure? Is there any additional opportunity or are the systems is essentially the same? Vincent Roche : Well, the -- apparently, the demand for spectral efficiency is going to increase several orders of magnitude. And one of the methods that we're going to use to get there, obviously, the bandwidth has got to increase, but the -- we're going to be moving well into the microwave area. So the complexity of the problem is going to significantly increase in terms of all the things that we've been talking about, in terms of spectral efficiency, power management, power efficiency, obviously, cost per bit and so on and so forth. So with each successive generation, there has been more pressure on the technology to deliver ever-increasing levels of, as our customers would say, productivity, innovation productivity. So our belief, David, is that we're looking at orders of magnitude of complexity increase, which will continue to put pressure on our technology. But that's in our wheelhouse. That's what we like. We like hard problems to solve. That's what we build our business on. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Dave, I wanted to go back to the consumer business. If I look at a year-over-year compare, July quarter, consumer was down about 10%. The midpoint of your guidance is down close to 20% year-over-year, and notwithstanding sort of the inventory issues last year, I would have thought the July quarter would have been a more difficult compare quarter, because my understanding was that July last year benefited from builds beginning early in the quarter, throughout the quarter. And this year, the July quarter really only benefited from the month of July build for handsets. And so I'm kind of -- hoping you can kind of help circle -- or square the circle there for me as to why year-over-year growth would be so much worse in the October quarter than the July quarter in the consumer business. David Zinsner : Yes, I mean, simply put, John, we just had an inventory build that was pretty significant in the fourth quarter, and we do not expect hopefully to have that happen this time around. It'll be more closely aligned with demand. I would say that we do have a range, and as you get to the higher end of the range, that would suggest a lower or a, I guess, a lower year-over-year decline, yes, I guess, would be the way to describe it. So that's obviously a possibility, but not what we've built into the plan or the midpoint in the forecast. John Pitzer : And Dave, did the July quarter only benefit from builds in the month of July, or did builds happen earlier in July quarter than we thought -- or than you initially thought on the last conference call? David Zinsner : No, it was definitely more of a July ramp in the third quarter. I would say that probably on a weekly basis, it was probably at a higher level than it was last year on a direct compare of the months of July for this year and last year. Operator : Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : A quick one around the Linear acquisition. First, can you remind us of the timing -- expected timing to close? And Dave, can you also sort of relate your early experiences coming to ADI and then also your experiences working to help integrate Hittite? And maybe string a narrative as to the types of things we should expect to hear around integration when that begins. David Zinsner : Okay. I'll let Ali talk about the timing piece. Ali Husain : So yes. No, I realize that question is top of mind regarding timing, but we're not going to comment on the regulatory approval process at this stage. You'll see the conditions to the closing of the transaction, including required regulatory filings, they're all going to be in the Form S-4 registration statement and the proxy statement that ADI and Linear will be filing in connection with the merger in the upcoming weeks. So that takes care of the timing, Dave. David Zinsner : Good lawyered-up comment, Ali. Okay. So on the integration side, I would say -- obviously, this is going to be different. It's bigger. It's on a different coast, so it's not quite as -- it's not in our backyard. So we have that aspect to things. But I would say, fundamentally, it's going to be similar. We -- what I think we do is we buy really good companies, and really good companies don't need to be fixed. And so what we try to do is take the best aspects of each company and leverage them in the combined company to make something better than the sum of the parts. So that's really what we intend to do. We're just in the initial planning stages as we speak. We'll probably have a more formalized plan as we work with our compatriots over there at Linear Tech to help form a good integration plan together. And I think that will take the better part of the rest of our fiscal year to really kind of come to conclusion on. And then once we do have, I think, a more clear plan, we'll definitely communicate that to investors and to analysts. But at the moment, I think just our fundamental premise is take the best of both companies and make a better company is really how it's going to -- the main ethos of the integration. I think it's going to go well. I think we did a great job at Hittite doing those same things. And every integration is different, but I think the elements of that process are pretty much going to be the way we approach it this time. And so I suspect it's going to be a really great combination. Just the early reads from every customer we've heard from, our employees as we've been able to talk clearly about -- to the Linear Tech, we haven't got to every Linear Tech employee yet, but the ones we have talked to, I think they get the excitement of what this could mean. And so I think it's going to be a tremendous combination. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie : Great. Vince, I was hoping you could maybe give a high-level strategy comment on ADI. Obviously, you've been very strong over the years in analog-to-digital converters, good amplifier portfolio with Linear adding, as you mentioned, fantastic power. And so it seems you've got pretty much the soup-to-nuts, great stuff on Analog, as we think about increasing IoT applications out there, which, traditionally, hasn't been a big market for you guys, but -- so we think about that starting to invest more in digital makes sense, maybe ramping up investment in DSP, just curious your high-level thoughts on where you go after you've got the complete Analog portfolio here. Vincent Roche : Yes, great question. Good question, Steve. So yes, we view the IoT, it's the kind of latest marketing buzz in the world of semiconductors today. But we view IoT as really an extension of the things we already do. So there's a need for precise sensing, precise signal conditioning and conversion at ultra-low power levels. And there's -- our customers are asking us for -- to be able to take some of the bits we generate and develop information to interpret the bits and give them information, which we do in areas, for example, like reliable health care monitoring. So I think the way to view it is we've got a platform of technologies that we apply to industrial applications, take industrial automation, for example. So we've got the conversion technology, signal conditioning, amplification. We've got processing both on the DSP side. We've fixed-function processing that we develop. We're quite a larger user of ARM technologies, for example. A lot of our products now use MCUs, very, very low-power MCUs which we tailor for our applications. We've the RF technologies that we can bring to bear for the connectivity. And obviously, power management is a core part of the overall solution as well. So the underlying foundation of silicon technologies will be supplemented over time with more algorithmic technology. And Lyric, for example, that we acquired several years ago, is a key player in enabling us to bring algorithmic technology to bear. We're looking at how we make each -- anything that gets connected needs security. So as connectivity in the IoT sector is synonymous, it needs security. So that's something that we're actually experimenting with. We're looking at possibilities to acquire some technology there as well. So that's -- what I've described to you is we've got a very, very broad base of technologies that are enabling ADI in our traditional markets, these more connected or IoT markets, where sensing, measuring and interpreting is very, very important. And we're looking for tuck-in technologies and organic developments to move ADI further up the stack, for example, into the interpretation using algorithmic technology as well as security and communications. So hopefully that helps you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Shankar Subramanian : This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. A lot of good questions were asked about the segments, but I just want to ask about the OpEx side of things. You just mentioned having a tight OpEx control right now. In Q3 and Q4, you just guided to flat to up. But given Linear deal, are you going to be focused on keeping the OpEx at current levels until the deal close? Could you just talk about the trends from Q4 to middle of next year? And then how you think about the business long term? David Zinsner : Okay. So I think when history is written on 2016, we will have been roughly flat year-over-year in OpEx. So I think I concur with you, that's pretty good OpEx control. I think our goal is really to be largely flat next year at the ADI level. And what we'll do is, in certain cases, reprioritize our investments into areas that we're more confident around the growth levels and shift things around as appropriate and not seek to add a lot of resources, particularly as we're going to get a whole bunch of resources hopefully by the middle of next year in the form of Linear Tech employees. So that's kind of the goal. It likely means that OpEx normally comes down in the first quarter just because the revenue comes down and then it pops back up in the second quarter if revenue is kind of seasonal. But kind of roughly in these kind of zip codes, plus or minus $10 million from where we are today. Vincent Roche : Needless to say, we're operating as 2 independent businesses until we close. So we're, all the time -- we're very opportunity-rich as a company and we're all the time looking to pick the best opportunities, make sure they're properly funded. And we're always looking for talent. So within the boundaries of an OpEx model that is spending 18% or 19% in R&D, that's what we intend to do and scale it with revenue growth over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Krysten Sciacca : This is Krysten Sciacca for Romit. Just to go back to the consumer segment for a little bit. How did your consumer business outside of your largest North American handset customer perform? Ali Husain : Yes, I can take that one. It -- I would tell you, as we enter sort of the back half of the year for ADI, the consumer business has some positive seasonality. And so it actually performed quite nicely on a sequential basis and was about stable to the prior year. So hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : Your next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing : I believe at one point, you gave a full year CapEx target of $140 million to $150 million. You're running below that. Is that because of the Linear deal perhaps getting access to some equipment and factory output and maybe some spending you won't need here? David Zinsner : No, we just generally set a budget that we're going to spend at 4% of revenue. And I think coming into the year, we thought -- we didn't suspect this air pocket we'd run into on the consumer side, and so we had a higher expectation on CapEx. But given that the revenue was a bit lower, we lowered the CapEx so we could maintain the 4%. Ali Husain : Yes. And so that new number is somewhere in the range of $130 million to $135 million for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : Just given some of the color earlier on some of the growth in your wired infrastructure business because it's the 100-gig optical, I was wondering if you could provide some more color on whether that's primarily driven by hyper-scale data center customers or if there's some telco carrier CapEx driving that as well. And related to that is, looking forward, is that pretty much running in line with demand or is there some big element of capacity build ahead or buildout for consumption later on this year? Vincent Roche : Yes, good question. So it's driven by demand. I think there's a very, very good balance between what we're seeing in terms of demand and supply. There's obviously a huge amount of activity in the inter-data center connectivity. And we're participating in that with our customers, also long haul and kind of metro buildouts. And I think there's a good balance between the 3. But it seems that the data center is hotter at this point in time, and looks like it will be a wave for several years to come. So I think it's a good mix and very good balance between demand and supply here. Operator : Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, a quick question around the Linear merger. Curious what kind of conversations, if any, you've had in terms of walking up talent there. And as you think about your compensation plan versus theirs, what are the implications to OpEx going forward? Vincent Roche : We're operating as 2 separate companies until we close. And obviously, when you look at both companies actually, we've had tremendous -- we've got tremendously long tenure in both companies, and the attrition rates run very, very low in both companies. And I expect that to be what it will -- that will maintain its pace for many, many years to come. People remain with these companies because we do exciting things. We solve big, big hard problems. We've got very strong cultures. And I believe that just as it was so with Hittite and ADI, it is our goal to make sure that we win the hearts and minds of all of our engineers who really create the value for both companies. And I'm very confident about that based on the conversations I've so far had with LTC leadership. And I see that as being a tremendous value and strength of both companies. David Zinsner : I would say that, from an OpEx management perspective, the -- we run in this -- into this every time we integrate a company. There are always slight differences in terms of how the compensation works. And I think we're pretty good at figuring out a way that we can do it that works for employees and keeps them energized and engaged and simultaneously doesn't have an impact on our total OpEx and our ability to manage our OpEx appropriately. So we haven't worked out the particulars of that. That will also be done over the coming months. But I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to address employees' concerns and shareholders' concerns and come up with something that's optimal. Operator : And our final question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your content win in consumer, where you're seeing the design wins, how fast is content this year growing relative to last year and how sustainable is that rate of growth going into next year? David Zinsner : Well, as I said, it's -- the content increase is 30%. We can't get into the details. We have confidentiality requirements with our customers that don't allow us to go into any more detail other than that. Vincent Roche : The wins are consistent with our stated strategy. We play in really, really high-quality problem areas in the user experience. And the wins we've had are very, very consistent with that stated strategy. Ali Husain : Okay, great. Well, that was the last question. So as a reminder, our fourth quarter and fiscal '16 results will be issued on Wednesday, November 22 at 8 a.m. Eastern and the earnings call will begin 2 hours later at 10 a.m. Eastern. So that's it from us from Norwood, Massachusetts. And so thanks for joining us this morning. We'll talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain : All right, great. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining ADI's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal '16 Earnings Conference Call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and the investor toolkit at their usual spot at investor.analog.com. And specifically, about the investor toolkit, it's something we post on our website 2 hours before the earnings call, and it's actually a pretty good summary of our prepared remarks. So for those that are interested in kind of getting the early scoop, that's probably a good place to go as we file our press release.  With me on today's call are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. Before we start, let's do our disclosures. Please note, the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-K. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in today's earnings release, which we've posted at investor.analog.com. And so with all that behind us, let's get started. And I'd like to turn the call over to Vincent Roche, our CEO. Vincent Roche : Thank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. By almost any measure, ADI had an excellent fourth quarter. To put it in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $1 billion, expanded operating margins to a record 38% of sales, and we generated record free cash flow margins of 44%. Throughout fiscal 2016, as you know, caution and uncertainty were the norm across the world. Nevertheless, we executed well in a tough business environment, investing and positioning ourselves for future growth while remaining disciplined and making smart investment trade-offs. All told, the actions we took during the year drove free cash flow margins to 33.7%, a 520 basis point improvement over the prior year, and I'm very proud of the stellar execution by our entire team. For ADI, it starts with an obsession for customer success, and I personally spend, as you know, a lot of time talking to and listening to their needs. It's obvious to me from these conversations that ADI is an exceptional company, and we are more relevant to our customers than ever before. What is also clear is that our customers are seeking true innovation partners as they grow and evolve their businesses in the midst of unprecedented levels of complexity, at the same time, our customers' hardware engineering talent to stretch thin. As a result, they're increasingly focusing their design efforts on systems and software, while turning the analog design challenge to ADI, where we have economies of scale and of scope. With the analog design challenges said to become even more complicated and critical in the area of IoT and Industry 4.0, for example, helping our customers bridge the physical and digital domains is -- in mission-critical applications will, we believe, create tremendous opportunities for sustainable, profitable growth for ADI long into the future. Customers choose us because we've been at this craft for over 50 years now, and in our industry, brand matters. The ADI brand is synonymous with high quality and high performance, and our customers rightly, have full faith that ADI will support them today, and well into the future. We have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to innovation that creates economic value for our customers by investing strongly in our own business. Since the Great Recession, ADI has invested $4 billion in research and development alone, primarily in the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure. We've also made investments in quality, manufacturing, supply chain and field operations because being able to effectively and efficiently deliver high-reliability innovation and customer support is just as important as the innovation itself. In addition to these organic investments, we've been acquiring capability that not only builds our technology base but also enables ADI to move up the value stack. During the year, we announced the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology, which, once complete, will create a high-performance Analog leader, with the combined company having a top 2 market share position across all the key building blocks of the analog market, namely data converters, power management, amplifiers, interface and high-performance RF and microwave. Once the transaction closes, we will have the ability to meet all of our customers' analog and mixed signal needs in sticky, long-life cycle, high-value applications in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets. During the year, we also acquired some very interesting early-stage technologies, which we believe will help ADI move up the value stack, as we say, over time. The acquisition of SNAP Sensor gives ADI the ability to provide our customers with very high dynamic range imaging capabilities, important in Smart City applications, as an example. For smart factory applications, we acquired Innovasic, a developer of deterministic Ethernet switching and software solutions to extend our reach in this core market. We also acquired the Cyber Security Solutions business of Sypris, giving ADI the ability to provide customers with a trusted sensor-to-cloud solution, with security right down at the node. And just recently, we announced the acquisition of some exciting LIDAR technology from Vescent Photonics that will enable ADI to develop a true, solid-state scanning LIDAR system, complementing our existing radar-based ADAS offerings, and these things are very important in autonomous driving applications.  The investments we've made and continue to make are helping create economic value for our customers, and I'd like to share a few examples of where ADI's technology is making a real difference. In the automotive space, our recently announced A2B audio bus structure provides vehicle manufacturers with high-end, in-cabin audio fidelity while reducing vehicle weight. We estimate that our solution helps save car manufacturers approximately $30 per vehicle in combined CO2 taxes and fuel efficiency. In the area of factory and process automation, our software configurable input-output solutions are solving significant channel density, physical space and terminal challenges, while reducing system complexity and installation and wiring costs. And in the health care arena, ADI's vital signs monitoring products are bringing clinical-grade care into the home, enabling high-quality remote patient monitoring that reduces or even eliminates the need for and cost of a hospital stay. Ours is a customer value creation journey, 51 years in the making. We have the intellectual capital, and more importantly, we have a talented, passionate and engaged team at ADI to help serve our customers' needs today and well into the future. The combination with Linear Technology represents the next phase in this value creation journey. With our market-leading product portfolios tied to attractive markets, we believe we can create a free cash flow engine that will be unmatched in our industry and help provide investors with an attractive combination of growth and shareholder value for many years to come.  So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for details on our performance by end market in the fourth quarter. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Vince. So digging deeper into our results by end market, the industrial market at 39% of revenue, increased 6% sequentially, a very strong result in what is typically a weaker period for the industrial business. Revenue from our broad base of small- and medium-size customers was better than seasonal and in fact, increased sequentially, and the expected rebound in the aerospace and defense sector is also pretty strong. And our health care business also posted record quarter as we are now beginning to see the early returns from our investments in the health care sector. And compared to the prior year the industrial market showed actually pretty considerable strength, growing 8% over the prior year, and it was broad-based strength across all of the industrial sectors as we compare the year-on-year performance.  The automotive market at 14% of revenue increased 5% sequentially, and that was broad-based growth across, really, all sectors within this market, but I'd say, more importantly, automotive revenues increased 7% compared to the prior year. Communications infrastructure sales at 17% of revenue decreased slightly from the prior quarter. Both wireless and wireline application revenues decreased slightly sequentially but increased compared to the prior year, led by growth in 100-gig-plus optical networking applications. The consumer market at 29% of fourth quarter revenue increased 58% sequentially and decreased 7% compared to the prior year, with both sequential and year-over-year results, largely due to portable consumer application sales. So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and in fiscal '16. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on fourth quarter and fiscal '16 P&L line items will exclude special items, which, in the aggregate, totaled $39 million for the quarter. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and our calculation of free cash flow are on schedules E and F in today's release. So with that, Dave, it's all yours. David Zinsner : Thanks, Ali. The fourth quarter was once again a very strong and profitable quarter, and we set records for revenue, operating margin, free cash flow generation and earnings per share.  Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.05. Gross margins of 66.6% increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter and included a 120 basis point benefit relating to the sale of previously reserved portable consumer application inventory. Excluding this item, gross margins were in line with guidance, decreasing 60 basis points from the prior quarter due to mix.  We continue to tightly manage inventories, and as a result, inventory on a dollars basis in the fourth quarter decreased $16 million sequentially, and inventory on a days basis decreased 17 days to 105 days. Weeks of inventory and distribution were slightly below 7 weeks and were at the leanest level in 6 years.  Operating expenses increased 3% sequentially, lagging well behind the 15% sequential increase in revenue. As a result, operating profit hit a record 38.1% of revenue, expanding 400 basis points sequentially and 220 basis points over the prior year. Other expense in the fourth quarter was approximately $20 million. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 10% as we adjusted our full year tax rate to approximately 11%. Excluding special items, our business delivered strong operating leverage even with low utilization rates, and diluted earnings per share grew 28% sequentially to the $1.05 per share, which was almost twice the rate of sequential revenue growth. We had a record cash generation quarter, with free cash flow margins of 44%, expanding 600 basis points compared to the year-ago period. Capital additions during the quarter were $41 million, and we expect fiscal 2017 capital additions to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million.  During the quarter, we paid $130 million in dividends, and our long-term financial model incorporates annual dividend increases of 5% to 10%. At the current stock price, ADI's dividend yield of $1.68 represents a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%, although maybe a little bit lower, now that the stock rose today. Now I'll take a moment to talk about our performance in 2016. Revenue of $3.4 billion was stable to the prior year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 3% from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross margins and higher interest expense, ahead of the Linear Tech deal close. The lower gross margins for the year were primarily the result of a very deliberate and disciplined inventory management program that reduced inventory on a dollars basis by $36 million or 9% and, on a days basis, reduced inventory in the fourth quarter by 9 days to 105 days. Nevertheless, gross margins remained relatively stable to the prior year as we minimize the impact of lower factory utilization rates through pricing and cost efficiencies. The good news is that inventory levels are now in excellent shape.  All told, fiscal '16 free cash flow margins expanded by over 500 basis points to 34%, setting a new company record. During the year, we also returned almost $900 million or 77% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. Of course, the biggest news of the year was the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology. To date, we've received regulatory clearances in Israel, Germany, Japan and the United States, and we now expect the transaction to close by the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2017.  Our integration planning teams are hard at work, and we're very pleased with their progress. Vince has put me in charge of the integration effort, and I'm confident that our combined company will be greater than the sum of its parts.  We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow and for accretion levels to increase, as we begin realizing the planned $150 million of annualized run rate synergies within 18 months of the transaction close. During the quarter, we also made good progress on financing the transaction, locking up a $5 billion term loan facility. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate the all-in coupon rate related to the financing to be approximately 3%.  So now turning to our outlook and expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes non -- or known special items that are outlined in today's release.  Order rates are currently stable across our business as we enter the seasonally slow January quarter. As a result, we expect revenue in the first quarter to decrease sequentially, and be in the range of $840 million to $900 million but to grow 9% to 17% over the prior year. With inventory levels and utilization rates in good shape, we anticipate gross margins in the first quarter to be between 65.5% and 66%. We expect operating expenses in the first quarter to increase slightly sequentially and for operating profit before tax to be well north of 30%. We're planning for our tax rate to be approximately 11%, which is our planned non-GAAP rate until we close the Linear transaction. In total, excluding special items, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be between $0.68 and $0.78, which would represent year-over-year earnings per share growth of 21% to 39%. This was a great quarter for the company, and we're very proud of our achievements, but as Vince always says, we should be often pleased but never satisfied. It is our job to make sure that we continue to exceed expectations. Our customers, employees and shareholders would expect nothing less, and neither do we. So with that, operator, let's open up the floor for questions. Ali Husain : All right, Jennifer, so we'll get to questions in a second. [Operator Instructions] We're running this call until 11 :00, so I think there's plenty of time to get to everyone's questions. So Jennifer, I think you've got the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I know the rule, but I had a quick fact check for Dave, and then I had a longer term for Vince. Dave, and I apologize if I'm missing it, usually, in your prepared press release, you do give the end market breakdown for the coming quarter. I don't think I saw it this time. David Zinsner : Yes, maybe we ordinarily do. Okay. We'll give you 2 questions, Ambrish. I would say, just kind of directionally, the B2B businesses, which we would consider industrial, automotive and communications, will roughly be down mid-single digits. And of course, consumer, I think, would be roughly in the 30% down range in that. What was your other question, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes. For -- my other one was a bit of a longer term for you, Vince. And this is going back to a conversation you and I had a while ago. I know you've been on a path to transforming ADI, and you've talked about inorganic as well as organic and thinking more of a value creation as opposed to what we are used to, design in, design out. You kind of showed it in the consumer side so far that you're not a one-socket win. But give us a perspective of where we are. And I know baseball season is over, and I love cricket, but cricket is a bad analogy. There's only 2 innings. So where are we in that transformation, Vince? And just help us with that perspective. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. Good question. So look, we're on a journey. We believe -- we said several years ago, we believe that there's enough impetus in our business and that we had the balance sheet as well to help us get this company towards $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in a reasonable period of time. And we are well on track. I believe, over the next several years, we'll be updating -- obviously, when we integrate LTC, we'll be updating all the benchmarks around what we expect revenue to be over time, profit, free cash flow, and so on, so forth. So I don't know. I'm not a cricket fan at all, Ambrish. I don't know cricket, and I'm only an amateur in terms of understanding baseball. But I would say, we're still in the probably -- in probably the first quarter of the transformation. So we have... Ambrish Srivastava : Okay. That's football. Vincent Roche : We have many, many years of upside. As I said, what makes me very optimistic about this business is that the analog domain essentially sets the performance for all the systems that make up this massive information communications technology sector. It's one of the foundational technologies. Our customers are asking us for more, more, more. And we are getting to the point now, where we can be very, very choosy about the problems that we solve, and we can solve those problems across the board from microwave to mix signal to digital signal processing to power, sensor technologies. So I think there's a huge innovation upside. That's the root of this company. We're in a better and better position with our customers. So I'm very optimistic that we can get this business well beyond $5 billion in a reasonable period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Dave, can you remind us where utilization is right now? And what are your plans for the next quarter? Obviously, you've done a great job bringing the inventory days down, but kind of as we look forward from here on, how should we think about utilization and inventories? David Zinsner : Good question, Tore. So utilization was in the kind of high 60s in the fourth quarter. I would expect it to be roughly in that range in the first quarter, which is somewhat atypical for us for our first quarter because, generally, we're working our inventory back down in the first quarter. And with industrial usually having a sequential decline in the first quarter as well, it generally drives our utilization down a bit. But given that we have done so well, or I guess, the operations group has done so well in terms of managing inventory this year, we can keep utilization a little bit higher going into the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra : Related question on the gross margin guidance when we adjust for the sale of previously reserved product. You had a sequential trend in gross margin guidance that's better than seasonal, and you just mentioned the utilization rate being better than what you would see typically in the fiscal quarter. Is there anything else in terms of mix that also has an impact on gross margin, maybe some weakness in base station or anything else that you could give us color on? David Zinsner : Yes, no, I think it's generally utilization that's going to drive it, because, in reality, mix on a year-over-year basis is actually a little bit worse, because, if you remember, the first quarter was a pretty difficult quarter for us with regard to consumer, came down quite a bit. This year, it won't have as dramatic a decline. And so mix is a little bit negative, but utilization will offset. And I'd say the other thing, just anecdotally, is the operations group has done a very good job on the spending side, just really managing the expenses there. And so we've incrementally, I'd say, every year, been doing a bit better in terms of spending. And then on top of that, there's obviously, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been focused on pricing as well. And so I think those things have just had an incrementally little bit of a benefit every quarter. And then, of course, utilization drives a lot of it, and the offset would be mix... Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : On industrial, and understanding it's a big macro overlay to industrial, but nice to see the broad-based strength, can you talk about, Vince, just maybe some of the applications or product that you're excited about in terms of where you're seeing some investment by your industrial customers? Vincent Roche : Yes, I mentioned in the prepared remarks there, Craig, for example, in our core businesses, like robotics, for example, there's a need to be able to push the speed and the accuracy of these robots to ever higher levels. That's a tremendous digital signal processing challenge. And we've been building complete solutions that are only coming to fruition now for that area to enable much higher speeds in the operation of the robots with lower power, much greater accuracy. So it's complete signal chain of digital signal processing technology and mixed-signal technology. I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well some of these software-defined input-output structures that are enabling our customers to deepen the penetration of sensors into their environments and to dramatically reduce the complexity of installation and the costs. Energy is another area. It's a slow burn market, but it's an area where we have tremendous technology in transmission and distribution and also in the metering of energy. So those are just a couple of areas. And I should say as well, we combined -- we just lump healthcare into the industrial sector as well. And we've seen this is a market where we've been investing, I would say, modestly but very determinedly over the last 7 or 8 years, and we're beginning to really see the returns come good there in terms of revenue and profit. So I'll give you an example. We -- using integrated silicon photonics and signal processing technology, we've changed the way our customers can implement CT scanning and digital x-ray. We're bringing clinical-grade vital signs monitoring beyond the hospital into the clinic and the home. So those are all things that are making a big difference to ADI. I should point out, by the way, as well that we're on a quarter -- we're on a $0.25 billion run rate now with our health care business, with very, very good profits and a good outlook. Again, it's a slower burn business, but it's a terrific bet for the future for ADI. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : I'm going to ask the Trump question since I get it 5 or 6 times a day. So who knows what this guy is going to come up with policy-wise, but maybe if you can just share with us your sort of thoughts on how you think this impacts you, what your concerns are, what you think any positives could come out of it for ADI and the industry? Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Vincent Roche : Well, it's a good question. But we're getting into our 52nd year now as a company. So we've gone through many regime changes across the world and many, many -- how many American presidents is that. So I think let's just wait and see. We don't know. We hear -- like everybody else, we hear the rhetoric. We've yet got to see what the policy's going to look like. But maybe on the margins, it'll be good, at least for the American business environment. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess, I just want to go back to the Linear transaction for a second. You've had more time to I think go through this and review this. I'll say the number one question we tend to get is just how much of -- what sort of manufacturing optimization savings could you get from the transaction over time? And what sort of upside would that yield versus $150 million you've talked about? So anything you can talk about just manufacturing integration optimization you can do, and if that would be incremental to what you've talked about? David Zinsner : Thanks, Amit. That's a good question. Let me start, though, since you asked it -- opened up the Linear question. Why don't we just start at the beginning -- at the top here. We've actually spent the last several months really focusing on how the integration will go as of day 1. I would tell you that where we have gotten a lot more optimism is around the revenue side. We were already coming into this, and this is the reason you do an acquisition like this is to get revenue synergies. We're already coming into the acquisition thinking that we would get hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue upside over time. Of course, it takes a while to get that kind of revenue upside, but eventually. I would say that we're even more optimistic about getting revenue synergies. The teams have sat a number of times and talked through where there might be opportunities for the combined company to really address markets and deliver products that we hadn't in the past. And that -- the fruits of those conversations have been very, very positive. On the manufacturing side, I think that right now, we're going to go in with the footprint that we have. And what we do and what we've always done is optimize that to our needs. And we'll continue to look at it. So I don't know beyond -- I think we had roughly thought that there's about $50 million of manufacturing synergies through purchasing power and so forth. Whether there'll be more, several years down the road, we'll just have to wait and see. But for now, I would call it about $50 million. And then we expect there's probably another $100 million of OpEx synergies. There's a lot of early wins that we've identified through the efforts in planning the integration to obviously the public company expenses. But there's a lot of things that we spend in terms of outside services and so forth that we don't need to spend 2 of. And so I think we'll get some very quick cost savings out of that activity. So if anything, I think we're very positive. I would tell you that the other thing we talked about when we announced the acquisition was that we thought our tax -- blended tax rate would be 19.5%. I think, today, now we believe that's more like 15%. So that actually pushes up the near-term accretion number from about 10% to probably about 15%. So if anything, we're more optimistic about the near term and incredibly optimistic about the long term. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : Just looking at the model bottoms up and going back a bit to Ambrish's question. So if my model's correct, not only did you have record margins in the quarter, but auto and industrial also had record quarters. And as I look at the outlook, the 13% midpoint year-on-year growth, relative to ADI's history and global GDP growth, I think we would typically look at the analog industry growing at a 2 to 2.5x multiple of global GDP growth. You're growing at 4x that. So as we look at the business and where it is now and the early payoff in some of the platform investments the company has made, are we seeing the company start to move into a phase where its growth rate, relative to its own history and relative to the industry, is now at a nice premium to what we would have seen in the post-Lehman and even pre-Lehman periods? Vincent Roche : Yes, I think, firstly, you've got to take growth over a longer period of time. It's a longer integral. But yes, as I've said, what makes me very optimistic about things is that we're innovating like never before. And our -- we're solving big, meaningful problems of greater impact. And our customer relationships are such that, I think, we're very, very well positioned to be able to partner with them to really uncover what they believe to be the most intractable challenges, both in terms of their innovation and their commercial impact. So, yes, I think we're innovating in a way that gives us tremendous opportunity for growth. And as I said, we've got the customers with us. So I think I would expect -- we've said that our long-term growth model is 2 to 3x GDP. I think we're well positioned to at least deliver that organically. And as I said when Ambrish asked the question earlier, we will be updating our models over the coming couple of quarters once we integrate LTC here. So we'll give you more color and visibility. Operator : Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : I guess, I also had a housekeeping question. Dave, you mentioned that you thought consumer would be down in the ballpark of 30% sequentially next quarter. But just mathematically, that doesn't give me the B2B down mid-single digits, so B2B-specific items will be down more than that. So were you just sort of rounding on the consumer number? Or is there something else going on with the math? David Zinsner : Yes. I was rounding on the consumer number. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. So you expect it to be down more? David Zinsner : A little bit more. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That's the housekeeping question. If I could ask the real question now. Just last year, you gave us a little bit of color on content increases for Apple. And obviously, the businesses -- consumer was down a little bit this year, but not much with the content increase offsetting the inventory reduction. What do you guys see for content increase on the next cycle for that product? David Zinsner : I think it's too early to tell right now. I think we feel good about our content right now. Whether there'll be any additional items, it's, I think, difficult to say right now. Operator : Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Actually, just a follow-up there on the consumer side. The 30-ish decline seems fairly normal. So just wondering if you can compare and contrast this year versus last year. And then you have additional components. Are you seeing any yield issues or anything else like you saw in force touch this year? Or is it fairly smooth? David Zinsner : Yes, we don't -- it's fairly smooth. I think what you saw kind of on a year-over-year basis as we came down a little bit while increasing content. So the driver of the opposite kind of force here was obviously, the inventory build that happened last year that doesn't appear to be happening this year. So it's kind of tracking as you would normally expect. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : On the OpEx side of things, I realize you only have a couple of quarters left before Linear comes into the equation, but Dave, can you walk us through why you're guiding it up sequentially? If I look historically, I can't find a quarter in the last 4, 5 years where it was actually up. And then how do you plan to manage the organic OpEx up until that Linear integration? David Zinsner : Well, I'll take the second question first, which is, very carefully, I mean, we're not looking to build or add a lot of resources right now, because we're going to inherit a lot of resources from Linear Tech, and we want to optimize that combined workforce that we're going to have going forward. So we're very, very, very cautiously managing OpEx, I would say, for the most part, keeping headcount flat. Maybe there's 1 or 2 people here or there that we need to add for one reason or the other. There is a dynamic within our compensation plan, variable compensation plan, that makes this phenomena happen every so often. And that's a situation where, on a year-over-year basis, we have pretty meaningful growth, which is a component of our variable comp. And so while, as you point out, we do a pretty good job with the fixed expenses, bringing them down in the first quarter on a sequential basis, and generally, the same thing happens with a variable compensation. In this particular quarter, that's not going to be the case because of the year-over-year component is going to actually drive a higher bonus payout. So that's really the dynamic there. Otherwise, it would have been kind of largely as you would have expected it to be managed in the first quarter. Ali Husain : And I think, as you mentioned, Dave, in the prepared remarks, the operating margin in the first quarter is going to be, I think, in the midpoint around 32%, just pretty strong. I think we'd have to go back 5 or 6 years to see those kinds of operating margins in the first quarter. So okay, good question. Operator : Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong : Your B2B segments, industrial, automotive, comms, they've all swung from year-over-year declines a couple of quarters ago to solid 6% to 7% growth in October. Sounds like your January comm guidance assumes about the same. Are you seeing any subsegments of these accelerating or actually strengthening from that, that very good October level? David Zinsner : No, I think they're all pretty much behaving as you might expect. I mean, there are areas that we're obviously seeing just strength in general. Vince mentioned the health care space. Clearly, the aerospace and defense business has been good. Areas around IoT that we focused on have done well. There are subsegments of the auto space like ADAS and powertrains so forth. Vince mentioned the A2B platform that we have in auto for the infotainment area. So all those things are doing probably on the marginal, a little bit better, but I would say it is a very, very broad-based situation with the B2B space. And pretty much every subsegment is doing well. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie : Just help me to get some quick color on LIDAR opportunity. What do you see that opportunity for you guys as? And what does your acquisition bring to the table versus some of the competition out there? Vincent Roche : Yes, good question. So basically, the technology we've acquired is liquid crystal optical waveguide technology. And it's a solid-state approach to a very, very difficult problem, basically using a solid-state approach to optical beam steering. And that's critical if you're going to really push the resolution of LIDAR in the future. So -- and in contrast to other beam-steering methods, for example, like MEMS mirrors, the spinners that you've seen running around Highway 101 there are optical phased arrays. The technology we've acquired doesn't have any sensitivity to vibration, for example. So technically, we got great frame rates, no blind spots, and we can randomly steer the beam as well. So this technology, we believe, puts us firmly on the LIDAR road map. And combined with our radar-based advanced driver assistance technology at 24 and 77-gig really gives us 2 of the very critical technology modalities to enable, not only greater safety, which everybody craves in transportation, but also puts us well on the path to enabling our customers to get closer to realizing autonomous driving as a major trend in the transportation sector. So that's essentially what we see. And it's a potentially beyond $1 billion semiconductor TAM for this thing for us. So it could be potentially a wave, and that's why we bought the technology. It is reasonably early stage, but with the technology is working, now we've got to get it installed and make it work in the application. Operator : Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : I'm hoping you can address the reasoning behind the greater optimism for revenue synergies, specifically is this more of an inside-out view when you sit down with engineers and think about the products that you might be able to deliver, or is it more customer-driven where you're hearing feedback that requests a combination of products, let's say. David Zinsner : I would say it's a combination. Vince is going to add his color if he wants. But I would say it's a combination of, clearly, the business units, call it, the engineering portion of the business units, do see opportunities for products that they could make that would be special. But I think a lot of it comes from just the sales force of the combined company looking at the other companies' portfolio and licking their chops at what they could do with that -- those products in their geographies, their customers and so forth. I think that's really where we see a lot of the kind of nearside opportunities. Vincent Roche : Yes, I think maybe as well in some -- particularly, of the larger customers, there's an open-door invitation to do more together, with the portfolios that we have on hand as well as getting our engineering teams together to figure out how to create even more value in the future together in terms of how we invest in R&D and apply it. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Congrats on the great execution and the recovery in the B2B segments. My question, though, is related to the consumer segment. And what is the right way to model that segment for the next 2 years? If you were in our shoes, would you model that segment to be flat, up or down? Just given the large influence of one of your customers in that segment, it's really hard to model that. So I was just wondering how you would be modeling it if you were in our shoes. Vincent Roche : Well, from a top line perspective, I'd say if we could get 10% growth compounded for the next few years in that business, we'd be very, very satisfied. Vivek Arya : But do you see -- do you have visibility for that, Vince? Vincent Roche : Well, look, you really have visibility into anything. I mean, the -- we work hard on building great products. We're working very, very hard on deepening our penetration, not just in one customer, but in several customers. So it's a rapid cycle business as well. And things can change. Markets can change. Application -- or products can hit, not hit. Products get -- can even at the customer level, be brought to market or canceled. So as best we can tell, we're happy with the position we're in, in terms of the products and technology we have, the relationships we've got with the critical customers in this space. So I'm optimistic that we can grow this business at the level I've said. And time will tell. We don't know. We can't predict because, also, it's a market with relatively fickle customers on the other side of things. So -- but I think we're well positioned to pick the upside, and that's pretty much what I've got to say about it. David Zinsner : Yes. I mean, one thing I would add is that we do track kind of the opportunity set. And if you -- we certainly have the opportunities to do what Vince said. And it is a matter of markets and applications taking off and so forth. But from an opportunity perspective, we're optimistic about what we can do in the consumer space. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : I guess, Vince, an earlier questioner rightly pointed out that within your B2B business, industrial and auto kind of established new all-time quarterly highs in the October quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the communications sector. You're still about $40 million below kind of peak revenue run rate a few years ago. I know not all of Hittite gets wrapped up into comms, but especially given the success, at least on the design side from the Hittite acquisition, I'm just kind of curious as how you view the outlook for the comms business. Why is that the business that's still kind of struggling relative to past highs? And what are kind of the growth drivers you see from here? Vincent Roche : Yes, well, again, I think you've got to take a very long-term view to the consumer space. We have been playing in this business from 1G into 4G. We're helping our customers with 4.5G. We're at the early stages of helping them architect 5G technologies as well. It's an important market for ADI. And with Hittite, we're able to bring a level of completeness to our customer solutions. We're seeing the growth we expected out of Hittite that we had thought was there. We're getting the growth. We're well positioned with our customers. And we're grinding out results in 4G. I think we are getting share in 4G. And on some of the older technologies, some of the 2.5, 3G technologies, clearly, there's price erosion, which offsets, to some extent, the growth that we get on 4G. But I think the customers are facing increasingly difficult challenges in this space. We're helping them solve them at an ever-increasing level of sophistication. So it's a way for the future, and we'll grind out the results quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year. And I think, as I said, we are in an increasingly good position to gain share in this space, particularly, as we begin to push our products as well towards single-chip radio solutions in future. So I think there are very few companies standing in the radial who can build a sustainable business for the long term, and ADI will be right at the top of that stack. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso : Wonder if you could talk about what you consider to be normal seasonality for the April quarter. And I ask because last year was the first quarter of the substantial revenue from the consumer segment, but that was undergoing the inventory adjustment. If we normalize for the inventory adjustment, what would your expectations be for normal April? David Zinsner : Yes, it's a good question, Chris. We're kind of in new territory. So I'll take a crack at it, but don't hold it -- hold me to it. I would expect, as is typical, the industrial and automotive sectors to have pretty good sequential growth. I think the industrial sector usually has about 10%, and usually, the automotive sector is a little bit below 10%, but they're both pretty strong. Comms will do what it does. It's more cyclical than seasonal, I think, in most cases. And then the consumer business, which is the big wildcard, I'm going to guess that it's down probably the same kind of level sequentially, as it was in the first quarter, probably in the 30%, plus or minus, or something like that in the second quarter again, and then, of course, we'll have a rebound after that in the third and fourth quarter as it seasonally does. But hard to say, but that would be my guess. Operator : Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I had a question on your incremental gross margins. I think, for the October quarter, on a year-over-year basis, most of your revenue growth dropped through to the gross margin line. And also for the January quarter, if we take the midpoint of your revenue and gross margin guide, again, I think, close to 90% or 100% of your revenue growth is dropping through the bottom line. So I guess, I'm curious, is this just product mix? Or are there other factors at play here? David Zinsner : Yes, I mean, drop-through works when there isn't a lot of, like, changes going on around working capital and so forth. And I think that's kind of masking things a bit. Like, for example, in the fourth quarter, as I talked about, we had this inventory release, which drove up the gross margin. So you have to kind of strip that away before you even look at it. And then in the first quarter, we are -- because we normally have this kind of utilization to climb in the first quarter, we're not going to have that because it's such -- the really good discipline we had through the year, this year, in terms of inventory management. It's at a utilization level that's kind of atypical for us. So I'm not sure drop-through is the best way to look at it. It's more a function of -- at least in the first quarter, it's more a function of utilization levels. And they're going to be in the kind of mid- to high 60s, and that's going to be really beneficial, relative to where we were last year at this time, which is kind of unusual for us. Operator : Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I was hoping to revisit the earlier comments regarding a 10% CAGR for consumer. If you look at your top customer in that bucket, I think 13% of your total revs in fiscal '16, that would imply your other consumer business declined about 25% year-on-year. So curious, the 10% CAGR, is that a reflection of your vision to rising content at your very large customer there? Or is it a reflection of seeing greater breadth with other consumer customers as you look out over the next 1, 2, 3 years? Vincent Roche : Well, I think it's a combination of all of the above. I mean, it's a long-term prediction. We have -- as I said, we've certainly got the customer engagements. No, we have the -- we've got the technologies and products. And I think we're solving problems that really matter. So what I'm indicating is that to my mind, it's probably more about how the market performs than individual, if you like, dynamics around engagements and individual customers. So it's really more about the market. So I think what we're talking about is the long-term expectation. We're investing at a rate that should enable us to get those kind of growth rates. And I will say as well that we have funded our B2B businesses. I mean, we're spending more than 90% of the company's R&D on our B2B businesses to make sure that we drive growth and capture the opportunity that's available to us in those sectors. So we're all the time making trade-offs in investment between the various applications in the B2B area, and we're very carefully picking up the vital few opportunities in consumer, where we think our technology makes an enormous difference to the user experience. Ali Husain : C.J., just a clarification. The outside of the portables business within consumer -- so outside of portables, consumer was up sequentially and was about stable to the prior year. Operator : Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Instinet. Romit Shah : Just regarding the merger, it sounds like early indications are good. But one of the things that's come up is just employee retention. Something to that extent was mentioned in the proxy. And one of the -- for some of us who have followed Linear over the years know that it's kind of a different culture, less COGS [ph] company. So I'm just curious, how are you guys incentivizing the Linear people to stay at the organization? And Dave, as we put our merger models together, should we assume that OpEx and stock comp sort of step up on a like-for-like basis after the deal closes? David Zinsner : Well, we do have -- we have a retention plan in place for them. So near term, we're not too worried about it. But I mean, I would tell you that my own view on this, Vince, probably can opine, is that engineers stay with the company or come to a company based on what they're doing and whether they're doing exciting things and -- or branded the opportunity to work on really difficult problems and do amazing things. And that's the environment we intend to create for both the ADI and Linear Tech engineers. So I'm not particularly worried about it. No, we're -- our compensation plan in the near term for ADI and Linear Tech people is to maintain what both of them have. Over time, they'll be homogenized, but I think, in a way that -- a manner in which we wouldn't see a negative impact of. Vincent Roche : Yes. Just add a little more color to what Dave has said, Romit. I've spent a lot of time, as many of our leaders have, with the LTC engineering community, the business community, operations community. And we share a very similar view of the world. We understand each other's businesses very, very well. We share a very similar value system, how we believe value gets created and captured. And I think there's tremendous excitement, by the way, all through both companies, incidentally, about how we can combine the complementary technology suites of both companies to do really marvelous things in the future. And as Dave said earlier, that our sales forces are really chomping at the bit to get the 2 bags for the ADI people, to get the LT power bag and the LT salespeople to get the ADI mix signal bag and really capture the opportunity that we think is available to both of us over the next 3 or 4 years. And I think, as Dave said, part of retention is a sense of equity and fair treatment in terms of compensation, and we pay a lot of attention to that. But the soft side of the adventure that people can undertake here and work together to do amazing things into the future, solving really critical, meaningful problems of the world, that's what people want to do. And I will tell you as well, we pay a lot of attention to retention, and I'm pleased to say that things are very, very stable on both sides of the fence. Operator : Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing : You mentioned pricing efficiencies helping gross margins year-over-year. I'm looking for color on that. So you have a pretty capable team in place now and for a while, and you've been -- I've been assuming you have been pricing by value of solutions. David Zinsner : Yes, I mean, it's basically that. I mean, we're -- as Vince mentioned, I think, in one of the questions, we're increasingly putting more and more robust technology in the products, some cases, algorithms; some cases, other software; some cases, it's just hardware. But it's just a really -- solving a really challenging problem. And what we do is work to try to get commensurate price for that value that we create. And not surprisingly, in a big organization, sometimes a little bit of that slips through the cracks. And what we've been doing over the last few years is plugging those holes. And so we're not looking to gauge our customers by any means. We're looking to find the right optimal level of price per value, and that's what we do every day. I think we've done increasingly a better job at that over time. Operator : Your next question is from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Harsh Kumar : On that answer you gave. There seems to be some trend among semiconductor companies that they can actually get paid very well for what they're doing. Historically, it's always been downward pricing. But now, I think, some of the companies are trying to raise prices and maybe get paid fairly. I'm curious, you mentioned -- you touched upon it in the previous answer, but I'm curious where your philosophy is as a company with that. And how much of an impact did pricing have in margins for the last quarter? David Zinsner : Right. So I think, Harsh, I would say that some companies who have been drifting into the 40s and maybe very low 50s in terms of gross margin, they got to get a whole new kind of philosophy in place for pricing. I mean, we do have -- we already had 60-plus percent gross margin. So we were actually pretty good at executing a strategy around this. It was more just cleaning up a little bit around the edges, where we probably weren't executing as well. Hard to put a number on it for the quarter. I would say, though, that on the average, over the last, say, 4 years, our ASPs are probably up 30%, 40% probably. So it's obviously been a pretty big impact in terms of our gross margins. Operator : Your next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree : Maybe just anymore color that you could give on the Wireline business. And you made some comments about strength you're seeing in 100-gig. Vincent Roche : Yes, so we've a reasonably significant business in the optical space in providing precision measurement and control for the various parts of the optical system. So it's grown well for the company over several years. And I think as the need for data center infrastructure buildout continues, medium and long-haul, backhaul connectivity continues to be pressured. We see it as a good bet for the future and probably at the higher end of the spectrum of growth that we have put into our model. Operator : And our last question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : I had a quick question on wireless infrastructures. I know that was down in the quarter. Was that broad-based softness in that business? Or was the -- were there any pockets of positive demand? And also related, how would you characterize the current, I guess, the level of rollout to 4G and 4.5G? Are there any more greenfield upgrade opportunities left around the world in the next couple of years? Vincent Roche : Yes. So I guess, in the quarter, the macro base station and the backhaul were down for the quarter. Our small selectivity was up. And I think China is reasonably strong. And our transceiver pipeline, by the way, across the board -- not just in base station technology, but across the board, is continuing to build a nice pipeline of opportunity. And also, we're converting the pipeline into decent revenue. I think we're still in the reasonably -- I mean, 4G is going to be around for a long, long time to come. It's -- the largest part of the world, by the way, is still on 2, 2.5 and 3G networks. So 4G will have a long life ahead of it. And as I said, we'll be grinding out share gains there in an increasingly fitting atmosphere here, if you like, in terms of suppliers. 5G is on its way. As I said, we're in the earlier stages of helping our customers to architect platform solutions. But yes, I think it's going to be many, many years out yet. So I think it will be -- I don't expect to see capital deployments from the carriers change an awful lot. So I think it'll be a slow and steady increase in the build-out of 4G. And I think that will be the environment till we get to 5G and see another specific step function ramp here. Ali Husain : All right. Thanks, Stephen. That looks like it's the end of the call. We had a good quarter. The deal here for Linear Tech continues to stay on track, progressing well here for a close. Inventory, as Dave has talked about, is in great shape, gives us good gross margin leverage going into 2017. Our business is now showing some really good momentum, especially in the B2B markets. You guys saw the results of some pretty strong operational execution this quarter, with our free cash flow margins up pretty significantly. So we appreciate you guys calling in, and we'll look to talk to you soon. Thanks. David Zinsner : Happy Thanksgiving. Vincent Roche : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain : Okay. Great. Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the Analog Devices First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and the CFO commentary at investor.analog.com. With me on today's call are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. So before we start, let's get through some disclosures. Please note the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. With the exception of revenue, our commentary about ADI's first quarter financial results will exclude special items, which in the aggregate, totaled $85 million for the quarter. When comparing our first quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in Schedules E and F in today's earnings release, which we have posted at investor.analog.com. So with that, let's get started, and I'll turn the call over to Vince. Vincent Roche : Thanks very much, Ali, and good morning, everyone. So by any measure, our January quarter results were stellar. Revenue of $984 million was well above the high end of our guidance, growing 28% over the prior year. And we have broad strength across all our markets. And we expanded operating margins over 700 basis points from the prior year to 35% of sales. Earnings per share of $0.94 was up 68% from the prior year and $0.16 better than the high end of our guidance. Importantly, we have generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months. So this was a terrific start for the fiscal year, and we continue to see momentum in our business and in our customer engagements. Our R&D efforts are squarely focused on the most exciting trends in the industrial, automotive, communications infrastructure, health care and consumer markets. I'd like to give you just a few examples of where ADI's technology is making a real difference. So in the area of data converters, which are, in many ways, the backbone of our mixed-signal franchise, for example, where we're the market leader, we once again established new performance benchmarks with our next generation of high-speed ADCs and DACs that exploit 28-nanometer CMOS technology combined with proprietary architectures and algorithms. By providing 4x improvement in critical high-dynamic range parameters, these converter platforms are enabling the next wave of gigahertz bandwidth, software-defined systems for 4G and 5G communications for test equipment and also in several aerospace and defense applications. It's the radio or radar equivalent of going from watching television using the old bunny ears to watching high-definition TV. We can now give our customers the ability to see things that they did not know were even there, and this is a real game changer. In addition, our previously introduced high-speed signal-processing platforms achieved record revenue based on our integrated transceiver platforms, which helped our communications infrastructure customers and beyond efficiently address the challenges of accelerating global data consumption. These solutions are equally well-suited to and are increasingly finding their way into a diversity of applications in the industrial instrumentation, aerospace and defense and indeed, the automotive markets.  In factory automation, our software-configurable input-output solutions are enabling our customers to create flexible and agile platforms that can be readily expanded and reconfigured to support more sensing and control channels on automated factory floors. In addition, in motor control and robotics applications, our measurement, control and isolation products are driving improvements in motor efficiency precision and reliability while maintaining the highest levels of safety and industrial robustness. ADI's health care solutions span both B2B and consumer applications. On the B2B side, we're enabling higher channel counts and throughputs in high-performance imaging systems that lower our customers' overall cost per channel but importantly drive higher ADI content per system.  And on the consumer side of health care, our vital signs monitoring technology is enabling highly accurate and ultralow power measurements of health -- critical health parameters, improving personal wellness and overall quality of life for the end consumer. Health care for ADI is now a high-growth business with its annualized growth rate running in the double digits. In automotive, our 77-gigahertz RF CMOS radar solution offers a robust platform for ADAS on the autonomous driving, giving customers the ability to capture objects earlier, more reliably and with greater precision and over much longer distances. And our investments in cost-effective, high-performing, silicon-based LIDAR solutions are turbocharging our efforts in this area.  These are the types of innovations that ADI is bringing to the market to better serve our customers' needs, and our industry and the market is taking notice indeed. In recognition of our overall innovation efforts, ADI received the 2017 IEEE Innovation Award and was once again selected by Thomson Reuters as one of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. It has been said that innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower, and ADI is very much at the cutting edge of innovation. This value forms the bedrock of our company's culture and belief system and is shared equally by Linear Technology.  So with that, let me give you a brief update on the status of the proposed acquisition of LTC. Thus far, we have received 6 out of 7 regulatory approvals needed to close the transaction, and our integration planning teams have been hard at work to combine the best of both ADI and Linear Tech in order to present one face to the customer on day 1. Also, I'm delighted that Bob Swanson, the Founder and Chief -- the Executive Chairman of Linear Tech, plans to join ADI's board after the deal closes. So we're all very excited about the combination of ADI and Linear Tech, which we believe will create an analog industry powerhouse that will accelerate innovation and revenue growth opportunities in our core markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets, which indeed are the most lucrative markets in our industry. The transaction is expected to be highly accretive to ADI's non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And it makes ADI the #1 or #2 player in all the major analog product categories, enabling us to solve our customers' analog system problems from end to end.  So overall, this was a remarkable quarter across multiple dimensions, and we see the momentum continuing into the second quarter. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for some more details on our performance by end market in the quarter just passed. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Vince. So just digging deeper in our results by end market, the industrial market was 41% of revenue. It increased 1% sequentially, which is really very strong in what's typically a much seasonal and slower first quarter compared to the fourth. We didn't really see much of a slowdown over the holidays, and I'd say January order rates were also very strong.  Within the industrial business, industrial instrumentation applications outperformed our expectations, and I'll highlight the ATE market as one that was particularly strong. And also the factory automation sector within industrial had a very good quarter. Compared to the prior year, the industrial market showed considerable strength. It grew 15%, and really was broad-based strength across all of the industrial sectors, so that's a very good result. On the automotive side, the automotive market at 14% of sales was also better than seasonal. It decreased really only slightly from the prior quarter but grew a very strong 10% over the prior year, led by really content-rich applications such as infotainment, powertrain and ADAS. On the communications infrastructure side, revenue there in that market was 18% of sales, again was also ahead of expectations, increased slightly sequentially and was up 4% over the prior year, led by optical networking.  The consumer market was 27% of sales in the first quarter. It decreased 8% sequentially, which is much better than seasonality as we saw continued strength in portable consumer applications. And consumer more than doubled over the prior year in the first quarter. So with that, I'll turn over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the first quarter and our guidance for next quarter. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on the P&L line items are on a non-GAAP basis. So Dave, it's all yours. David Zinsner : Thanks, Ali. Fiscal 2017 starts out on solid footing, with ADI delivering very strong revenue, profitability, earnings per share and free cash flow. Revenue in the first quarter, as we mentioned, totaled $984 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Gross margin's at 66.1% or above our guidance on a better mix of business and higher revenues. Inventory on a dollars basis decreased $11 million sequentially, and days of inventory were within our model range at 101 days, down from 105 days in the prior quarter. Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the high 60s, and we're planning to increase utilization to the mid-70s in the second quarter. Weeks of inventory and distribution were lean at approximately 7 weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we recorded a $49 million restructuring charge primarily related to a voluntary early retirement program for certain U.S. employees. Excluding this and other special items, operating expenses increased 7% sequentially, with the entirety of the increase tied to our variable compensation program, which is based on year-over-year revenue growth and operating margin metrics.  Nevertheless, operating margins at 35% of sales expanded over 700 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth and prudent expense management by the team. Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $26 million, the result of a partial quarter with the permanent financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $30 million per quarter until we close the Linear Tech acquisition. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 8%, which we expect will be our tax rate until we close again on the acquisition. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share increased 68% over the prior year to $0.94, as I said.  The first quarter was also a strong free cash flow quarter. We generated $286 million in free cash flow, which was an increase of 46% over the prior year. And over the past 12 months, ADI has grown free cash flow 20% to $1.2 billion or 34% of sales. Capital additions in the first quarter totaled $28 million, and we're planning for the capital additions in 2017 to be in the range of $130 million to $145 million.  In line with our shareholder value-creation strategy, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which represents an annual dividend increase to $180 per share -- I mean, $1.80 per share, sorry.  Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the second quarter of 2017, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes known special items that are outlined in today's release. After a record-setting first quarter revenue performance, which was also well above the high end of our guidance range, we're planning for the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure in the aggregate to grow in the mid- to high digits sequentially in the second quarter and to increase in the high single digits over the prior year. In consumer, we're expecting that normal seasonal patterns will prevail, and that this business will likely decrease between 40% and 50% sequentially. Nevertheless, we expect consumer to be up significantly over the prior year in the second quarter. In the aggregate, we're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $870 million to $950 million, which at the midpoint represents year-over-year revenue growth of 17% and would represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Gross margins are expected to increase to be between approximately 66.5% and approximately 67% on higher utilization rates and a more favorable mix.  We estimate that operating expenses will be down approximately 3% to up approximately 1% sequentially in the second quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.86, which at the midpoint, would represent very strong year-over-year earnings per share growth of about 25%. So to wrap it up, the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We had a strong year-on-year revenue growth with quality earnings and cash generation, and we expect this momentum to continue into the second quarter. So with that, we'll take any questions you have. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Dave. [Operator Instructions] So operator, it's all yours. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Relative to your initial guidance, the big upside in the Jan quarter came out of consumer. Just kind of curious, what changed throughout the quarter? Was this really just kind of a better mix with your large consumer customer where -- where that will give you larger -- or more content on a larger screen? And as you think about kind of the opportunity of that customer, how do we think about content going into the back half of this calendar year? David Zinsner : So I would say that, in general, with the consumer customer, sometimes, it's hard to totally predict kind of the weekly shipment level through the entire quarter. And so we make an estimate based on what we think will turn to the quarter plus what we come into the quarter with backlog. And there was -- there's varying degrees of -- or just varying scenarios, I would say, related to how that would go, and this was obviously the most optimistic scenario so it just turned out better. I would point out, though, that we didn't expect nearly the strength we saw in the B2B markets either, and so they contributed to the upside as well. So we're really happy that every end market did a bit better than expectations. So that was awesome. Vincent Roche : So just to add to what Dave has said there, John, we, as you know, have been working hard to diversify our position and decrease dependence on any single socket. And we have more content in these applications today than we had this time last year so that certainly helps as well. So we've got more ASP per system, and we continue on the track of diversifying to get more and more sockets in that area. Operator : Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : It looks like you announced a new distribution agreement overnight. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that and maybe this is an opportunity to just talk about the strategy in this [ph] going forward. Vincent Roche : Yes. So we've had a 3-decade relationship with distribution or maybe 25 years with the distribution channel in general. And what we're striving to do, Tore, fundamentally is we're trying to deepen the level of support -- and give a better breadth of service for our customers. We have many tens of thousands of customers. So the channel plays an important role, I think, in the broad breadth of logistics, services across the entire suite of customers and particularly with the smaller customers providing a lot of design service. So basically, we've decided to simplify the structure to enable us to bring the level of support that we desire. And we expect, basically, to be able to leverage the -- a more focused channel team that we've got and essentially draw on a more comprehensive suite of, in a more focused way, end-to-end support services that could range from design help, also prototyping, and of course, logistics support over the long term. So we're also -- we've been investing for all our customers, big and small, over the last several years by bringing on more direct resource and really understanding the role of the channel. So we're in a good place right now. And of course, when we combine with LTC, we will also have the opportunity to bring more field applications and sales resource to a broader breadth of customers. So overall, it's about -- it's part of our fundamental strategy, which is about innovation, diversity and operational efficiency, and the moves we're making here plays all 3 of those facets of our business model. Operator : Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava : Thanks for the update on Linear events. And Dave, last quarter, you had given us an update on the accretion on the tax rate. Now that you've spent quite a fair bit of time in rainy California, I was just wondering how should we think about the top line. And where I was going with this was, at CES, we had some early view on how a go-to-market would look like on a board with Linear and with ADI in an auto example. So question is really when should we be expecting it to show up and in what end market should it show up first? David Zinsner : Well, I would say we get more and more enthusiastic about the opportunities for combining technologies of Linear and ADI every time we meet together as a team. We have kind of loosely built in some expectation that we will get several hundred million dollars' worth of revenue synergies with the combined business. Some of that will take some time. I think a lot of it is going to be in areas where the design cycles and the time to revenue is quite long. So it might be out in the 2024, 2025 time frame where you really start to see us hit our stride. But within these first few years, we'll start to hit and see some revenue synergies. And I would point out that's kind of similar to the path we're on right now with Hittite. We're starting to see it trickle in a little bit in the early stages. We certainly have seen it build up in the opportunity pipeline for the subsequent years here. So we just get, I think every time we meet, more optimistic about what we can do as a company in terms of delivering technology. Vincent Roche : Most of the business of LT maybe combine this target at the core markets of B2B. So we see opportunity. I think at CES, you saw how ADAS, for example, combines the power technology of LTC with the mixed-signal technology and RF technology of ADI. But we have examples of that in the industrial automation, the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense. So basically, everywhere we play, including communications infrastructure where ADI is much stronger on the wireless side, LT is strong on the wired side, there's good symbiosis between the companies, particularly in the B2B space. And I think the first couple of years of the combination of ADI and LTC are really about how well together we take the pipeline of opportunity at unprecedented levels in terms of size at this point in time and convert that pipeline and service the heck out of our customers. David Zinsner : I will -- I'd also point out that, just on the expense side, as we had time to solidify the plans there, I think we feel very, very confident about our $150 million spend synergy. Part of, I've talked about this kind of restructuring charge we took this quarter related to this voluntary retirement, part of that is to kind of make some room as we integrate the Linear Tech people within the company. So in the 10-Q, it talks about a $28 million savings for just the salary and fringe related to those employees. But we find that there's some extraneous set [ph] savings like travel and so forth that also are reduced. So I think we have made a pretty meaningful down payment on the $150 million already in advance of even integrating. And then, of course, the public company expenses go away pretty quickly, too, and that's $20 million, $25 million of expense. So we are very confident now having worked on this and that really penciled it out that the $150 million is very achievable. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Dave, you piqued my interest on the Hittite revenue synergy side. Can you give a little bit more detail or anecdotes in terms of some of the things you're seeing from a design or revenue ramp perspective on Hittite? David Zinsner : Yes, Vince will probably do a better job of this. But I would tell you that in areas like aerospace and defense where they were particularly strong, we have pulled a lot of ADI content onto those systems and subsystems. That's been a big win for us. I think we did not appreciate how much opportunity we had in the aerospace and defense area until we really acquired Hittite and had that opportunity. There's a lot of radar capability that's required for the automotive space. And we're taking a lot of the capability we got from Hittite to be able to drive into that. The next generation, which we've talked about in the past, is 77 gigahertz for ADAS. And I think a lot of the capability that we pulled in from Hittite has helped in that regard. Also, I think that Hittite really just didn't have an opportunity to really address the larger OEMs, given their size. Around the edges, they might have won a little bit of business, but they really weren't breaking into the post OEMs in any meaningful way. That's all changed since they became part of ADI. And there's -- these are $10 million, $20 million, $30 million opportunities if you do them right. So I think we estimate that we probably have filled in the pipeline to the tune of $100 million of opportunities because of having the 2 entities combined that we would not have had otherwise. Vincent Roche : Yes. So we were running, at the time of acquisition of Hittite, which was just about 2.5 years ago now, the revenue stream was roughly $70 million a quarter. So we're running at -- on a percentage basis, a substantially higher level than that right now. And I think to add to what Dave has said, the conversation with our customers has changed over that period of time. I think Hittite and ADI have gone from being very potent component level suppliers to really now being able to architect our customers' systems in these new, for example, digitally oriented beam steering systems for radar, for mobile communications infrastructure. We're very much now working at the application level in rather than the component level out. So I think it's been really a win-win. And as our customers in the analog space in general are dealing with thinner and thinner levels of resource and capability in terms of engineering their analog solutions, we're very, very well positioned. And Hittite's helped enormously in the RF and microwave side of things, and LT will help us on the analog systems side with the power side of things primarily. So that's, I think, how to look at it. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : Considering the upside in the January quarter and then the guidance for the April quarter, what should we be thinking about conceptually for seasonal revenue growth in the July quarter? And then maybe give us your expectations, if only relative, for the 4 basic food groups of end markets for revenue growth this year? David Zinsner : Well, seasonally, usually sequentially, the third quarter is up. You tend to see a stronger consumer environment and the rest of the markets either are up or flattish. And then the fourth quarter generally is sequentially up again pretty meaningfully because you really start to see the consumer hit. I'd almost say in this case, we love our -- all our children equally. I mean, I think every end market has the opportunity to grow meaningfully from the prior year. We'll have to see how the rest of the year kind of shakes out. But we start off in a great situation. Our expectations for the second quarter, as we look at our backlog, look really good. So this continues into the third and fourth quarter, I think, every end market is going to do pretty well for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani : I guess, a question on the consumer side. It's clearly been better than your expectations. Could you just talk about how do you think about the segment over the next 12 months in terms of portables versus the rest of the consumer opportunity you have? And I think this Jan with your largest customer, you had talked about picking up 30% more content. Do you think that's possible again as they go through what, I guess, a super cycle product for the next year? Or do you see opportunity with your largest customer more in sync with the unit trajectory they have? Vincent Roche : Well, our consumer business is really a tale of 2 stories. We have prosumer, which is a more -- it's a business more akin to a B2B-type dynamic, so with many customers, many, many very high-performance building blocks from DSP to mixed-signal, in areas like audio and video signal processing. So we saw some downturn of that business over the last couple of years, but we've kind of hit the bottom, we believe we're at an inflection point there. So that's at least giving us stability, and that's kind of the bedrock of our consumer business in many ways. And so we're at an inflection there. On the portable side of things, we're clearly in a much better position than we were a year ago. We're working hard, as I said earlier, to diversify, to get more sockets and things like the image processing, control system, sensing in general, and also, we're engaging with many more customers than we did, I should say, on a pretty constrained, highly leveraged R&D budget. So look, is it possible that we get another 30% increase? Of course, it is, and that's what we're working hard to do to make sure we grab all available high-quality sockets that our technologies will match to. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : I wanted to follow up on a couple of the segment dynamics. And first, just looking at industrial and communications. Industrial looks like it's at record revenues, at least in my model, and it seems like there should still be some incremental strength that would come from areas like energy extraction, which I suspect may not be as strong as it's been in the past. And on communications, the business has been barely stable for the last 4 quarters. Is the strength that you're seeing now leading to a more material increase versus trailing fourth quarter levels? Or are we really just seeing a seasonal bump and nothing more than that? David Zinsner : Okay, let me take a shot at it. I'm sure Vince will provide better color than I can give. But I would say you're right in that the industrial business, I think, did hit a record this quarter, which is interesting in the fact that it happened in our first quarter, which tends not to be the strongest industrial quarter for us. So we'll likely hit an even bigger record next quarter, in the second quarter, since we expect it to be sequentially up. I think it had kind of a relatively pedestrian last year and maybe not as strong as we would have liked to see it. There was a few things on the macro side that impacted it. I think those have abated. And when you look at every subcategory within the industrial space, all of them are showing good strength. So I think that while it's early and we're always cautious about this, it does look like it's moving into a period of time where we start to see some meaningful growth. And quite honestly, we should. We made a lot of investments in that market. And there are a lot of opportunities to -- for analog content. And so I think we're starting to see the benefits of a lot of development over a lot of years. On the communications side, that business had been up. It came back down quite a bit in the prior periods. It had somewhat stabilized in the back half of last year, and we're in kind of what I think is a relatively stable period. Having said that, I do think there's a lot of opportunity in the comm infrastructure space for us. We have this new transceiver -- integrated transceiver that I think is doing quite well. I think we will see our performance in the wireless side be relatively better on the macro side than some of the competition. On top of that, we think that this small-cell deployment that has been long advertised and late to the party seems to have really started to gain some momentum here, and so we do expect to see some real traction in 2017 from that. And then lastly, an area that tends not to get as much focus is our wireline business. And with these kind of 100G deployments, 100-gig deployments that are going on right now, we're benefiting from that. And so our wireline business actually did particularly well this quarter. And so I think there's some expectation that through the next -- rest of the year, it will do quite well. So I don't know exactly how that -- the year will totally shake out yet. We always lack a bit of visibility out on the quarter. But I think the fact that it was pretty solid in the first quarter and we're expecting a reasonably good second quarter leads us to believe it will be a pretty good year for the comms business. Vincent Roche : Yes, something we don't talk an awful lot about in our wired business as well is cable infrastructure. And a lot of our new mixed-signal and data-converter technologies are enabling the carriers there to realize 4K and 8K video. And without our technology, it is impossible and to be able to do it within constrained physical space as well as power budgets. So that's an area that's doing very, very well for ADI in the signal path, along with, as Dave said, in the optical control chain. So I think our wired business is poised as long as the markets behave, well, our wireline business is poised for, I think, very decent growth in the years ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong : You mentioned you got 6 of the 7 clearances you need for the Linear deal. Can you remind us which the 6 are and what the seventh is you're waiting on and then an update of when you expect the deal to close? David Zinsner : I'll butcher the 6, so let me just tell you the one that we don't have. We certainly have the U.S. We have all the Europe ones. We have all of Asia, except for one, which is China. So we're waiting for China to approve it. I think it's well documented that, that's a long process, which is why we expected this thing to close around the end of April is because we knew that, that would be a long process. It's going very well. They do ask for a lot of information, and we have to go back and pull stuff together and present it in a way that is in a format in which they want to see it. And so we think it's going fine, and we would expect to be -- that we are on schedule to close this by the end of April at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : My question is on the automotive segment. It's very good to see the sales acceleration over the last couple of quarters despite, I know in the past, you've had some headwinds in some products. But when I look at some of your analog peers, say Texas Instruments, they grew their auto business by 20% last year. So my question is, when do you think those legacy headwinds will start to abate and you can close the growth gap with some of your peer group? Vincent Roche : Well, we're better and better positioned with our customers and across the various applications. But I mean, just for the record, our infotainment business grew in double digits over the past year and as did much of our powertrain, the battery controlled technologies as well. So some of our segments have performed well in the double-digit area. I think we've talked before very openly about the fact that we've withdrawn from parts of the MEMS-based safety market, but we still have an important role to play, particularly with very, very high-end inertial and gyro-sensing technologies for active safety control. And our ADAS technology continues -- the RF and microwave technology there continues to do very, very well. And we're very excited by the 77-gig technology that we're bringing to market as well that we showcased at CES. And that's a whole new level of performance that we're bringing to market there with 77-gig. So I think we're better and better positioned. We're doing a lot more business in Asia than we used to do, and so that kind of evens out the distribution or the diversity of our business across the globe. So those are the facts. And we continue to invest heavily in the space because we think it is a growth driver for many, many years to come for ADI. David Zinsner : And we'd tell you that Linear Tech's technology in the battery management system is quite good, and they have seen growth probably in excess of 20% probably in certain years. So I think that we bring that into the fold. That certainly will help just organically drive the growth but also will -- we should get some pretty good synergies. Where they have good customer traction is in places where we don't and vice versa. So I think we'll be able to pull each other into customers and engagements that we don't have today. So it should be, I think, a really good growth driver for us going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter in the guide and then also a little bit longer term, I was surprised in the January quarter that it was as strong as it was, given that the consumer side was so strong, so I would have thought mix, all else being equal, would have been a little bit of a headwind. And then the inverse, I thought, would have been true in the April quarter, where the combination of mix being a tailwind and you just said utilization was going to rise, I thought that might actually be to a little more upside. That's kind of the near-term part of the question, if you can give details on that. And then the longer-term one, if we just put Linear and ADI's gross margins together, talk about the deltas above and below that synergy values, anything else you can capture that makes it more than just 1 plus 1? David Zinsner : Okay. So let's start with this quarter. Well, I would say that if you remember through all of last year, 2016, we kept utilization relatively in check and really worked the inventories down because we really wanted to get the days down below 110 days. And we did achieve that by the end of the year. So like normally coming into the first quarter, we're not as well positioned in terms of inventory levels, and so we end up having to bring utilization down pretty meaningfully in the first quarter. And that didn't happen, so that ended up kind of helping the gross margins. On top of that, the industrial business just did really well through the whole quarter and so there was really hardly any reason to kind of crank down the fabs in any meaningful way. The mix part, it actually did impact us a little, but I would tell you that, that particular piece of business actually has pretty good gross margins comparatively speaking relative to other consumer companies out there. And so it doesn't -- it's not quite the headwind -- or it's not quite the headwind when we get it and it's not quite the tailwind when it goes away that you might expect. It might impact it 20 basis points or something. For the second quarter, as you point out, we should have a little bit better mix and we are bringing up utilization, although kind of modestly, it will probably be in kind of the mid-70s. There's obviously -- if the mix goes where the consumer kind of comes down as meaningfully as I said, 40% to 50%, and we do get to the kind of mid-70s kind of gross margins, it's possible that we would be at the really high end of that range, and we'd be up to the 67% range. So that's obviously a scenario. I think we're just hedging ourselves a little bit just in case we can't quite crank the utilization up to those levels because it does require us to -- while we have the equipped capacity, we still have to crank through the wafers and sometimes, that takes a little while to get cranking. Okay. Oh, on the longer-term side, yes, Ross, sorry about that. So then I think on a blended basis, we're kind of in the high 60s gross margins just kind of out of the gate. And then about $50 million of the near-term synergies that we're expecting will be in the gross margin line. So we would -- we should expect to get into the 70% range pretty easily, I think, with the near-term synergies identified. Honestly, I think longer term, we have the potential to get into low 70s for gross margins. We will get some -- we inherit some processes from Linear Technology that I think are quite strong. I think that will help out in the entire business. I think we will, over time, get more and more efficient in terms of our manufacturing spending. And so I think that will be beneficial to the gross margin line as well. And of course, I think as Vince had talked a lot about, we are really focused in this B2B space. And just quite honestly, those -- because of the design cycles and the technology required to deliver what those customers want, it just carries better gross margins. And so I think we will benefit from that as well. So we're optimistic we can get the gross margins into the low 70s. Operator : Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : On the aerospace and defense, obviously, that drives very good diversification within your business. Fundamentals here appear to be fairly solid. I think there are some pretty large radars, some satcom programs that are firing both in defense and in the commercial sectors. I know you guys talked a little bit about the synergies from Hittite, but just wondering, in general, how was the A&D subsegment tracking growth-wise on a year-over-year basis relative to the sort of 10% to 15% growth trend in the industrial segment now? Ali Husain : Yes. So I'll just take that -- the last question first. So it's been growing obviously at a very healthy clip over the last year or 2 in kind of the high single digits. I'd say in this quarter, it was probably in kind of mid- to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest of the question was what exactly? Harlan Sur : How do you guys see this business going for the full year? David Zinsner : Oh, for the full year this year? Harlan Sur : Yes. David Zinsner : Probably in that range. I think this is a kind of multiple of GDP kind of growth. It will be very correlated to how GDP grows, so probably mid- to high single digits. Operator : Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : I just want to follow up on a question. The B2B business is growing high single digits. If you take out comm, it's more like double digits. You've seen a lot of your analog peers see similar, and it's really a function of the kind of really no seasonality and then kind of growing off that base. Just curious to your perspective on the broader markets here as you talk to customers. Why is this market tracking at these double digits? And how do you see that affecting seasonality as you go through the year? David Zinsner : Well, I'll talk macro, and then I'm sure Vince talks to all these customers, so he can probably give you some more specific color. But I think last year, it didn't grow that much. And so part of it is just rebounding off of a much slower environment in 2016. So I don't think it's altogether surprising that we would see it start to come back. I would tell you though that I think we have, earlier in the period in which people have been focusing on this back in the '09 and even '08 before I even got here time frame, we really did focus our R&D efforts largely in this space. And I think we made it fairly public that we moved a lot of our consumer R&D into the B2B space to really focus on that market and in, particularly, the industrial markets. And so eventually all that development does translate into revenue as promised. And so I think some of what you're seeing in the results this quarter is that it's the opportunity's starting to translate into revenue more than anything. Vincent Roche : Yes, also, while America and Europe are very, very important, they're the bedrock, if you like, of our B2B business. We've been particularly pleased on the industrial side with the growth in our business in Asia as well over the last 2 or 3 quarters. So it's broad-based and strong in Europe and America but even stronger on a growth basis in Asia at this point in time. David Zinsner : The one thing that helps us get -- feel -- get some confidence around this, I don't want to oversell it just yet because one quarter doesn't make a pattern. But as you look out in terms of the inventory, particularly using disties as a proxy, it's actually fairly lean at 7 weeks. In fact, we normally run 7.5 to 8 weeks. And for the last, I don't know, maybe 4 or 5 quarters, we've been down at the 7-week level and we haven't seen a build. So that's good because it's getting consumed in various regions, particularly in Asia. Vincent Roche : Also if you look at the PMIs of the big CapEx-spending economies, they have been strong and strengthening over the last several quarters, so that certainly helps the B2B business. Operator : Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : I had a question about the Linear Tech pending acquisition, and it relates to the biggest concern I hear from investors, which is that there's a view that there are significant cultural differences between the 2 companies. I'm wondering what you've learned as you've built the plan to integrate the 2 businesses about the differences and similarities culture-wise, and what you see as the biggest risks and biggest opportunities now that you're presumably quite far along in that integration planning. Vincent Roche : Yes, so a good question. I would say that something I'm very, very clear about is that what we stand for as companies around the notion that innovation drives business success, that we drive diversity, diversity gives us tremendous resilience in the markets that we choose, lots of customers, lots of products, lots of different applications. And also, we're companies that focus really on getting great free cash flows from our business through operational efficiency, good price management. So those things we share together. Those are kind of the core business values that underpin both companies. So I would say, clearly, there are differences in the way we achieve our goals in terms of the behaviors in the companies, the routines to get the results that we get. And our approach to trying to create something better than the sum of the parts really is to leverage the best of both cultures. And that means basically pulling our business and operating processes together. We're working hard to figure out what is the best of both on the side of manufacturing supply chain. Obviously, day 1, it's critical that we have a single voice to the customer so we're working very, very hard on that. Also, from an ongoing technology and customer management, manufacturing standpoint, pooling our collective knowledge and wisdom to where we're combining the leadership structures, we're going to start combining the organizations to enable us to achieve those goals. And we're also looking for ways to get the blood of both companies flowing in each other's veins through cross-pollination, through physical colocation as best we can. So when I think what will be very, very clear is that our measurement and rewards system will emphasize what we both care about, which is long-term profitable growth. So that's essentially how we're approaching things. And I would say I'm very impressed with how both companies are leaning into each other and how we're working to truly try to get the best of both. David Zinsner : Yes. If there's anything we're concerned about, which was one part of your question, I would say we were so enthusiastic about this on both sides, and now we got to wait for all this bureaucracy to kind of take care of itself. So we're a bit anxious to get going, and it's just painful to wait as long as we've had to wait to get it done. But I think as soon as it closes, we will be off to the races in terms of making the sum of the parts -- or making the combination more than the sum of the parts. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano : This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question about your recently acquired LIDAR business. Could somebody talk about how its current position stacks up against the competition and how big of a revenue opportunity you think this could be over the next few years? Vincent Roche : Yes. So I mean, at an application level, to be able to realize these future semiautonomous and autonomous driving systems, you need lots of different types of eyes that are looking for -- they're looking for the signal, so to speak. So today, radar and cameras, this image processing from cameras, they're the important modalities. But LIDAR is becoming a very important modality. And today, that's realized with mechanical systems essentially. Our approach is to -- so we acquired Vescent Photonics, which enables us to bring a more silicon-based technology to bear, which is fundamentally -- it's inherently more mechanically robust and enables us to apply a lot of signal processing to the core sensing and actuation technology to get the kind of resolution and the kind of reliability and performance that we need to get. So I think it will be a very important part of the realization of these autonomous driving systems. In fact, I believe that semiconductor process technologies will enable this type of technology to become more broadly deployed. So that's, I think, the way to look at it. Operator : And your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree : Vince, maybe you've talked about underlying health of kind of global GDP trends. I guess, I'm just curious where you see yourself gaining share in some of the subapplications in B2B versus maybe that underlying market support. Vincent Roche : Yes. So if you take core industrial, I mentioned the fact that we're very pleased with our performance in Asia. I think that's been the result of many, many, many years of customer engagement, good deployment of R&D and that's working well for us. So I think a certain amount -- a rising tide will lift all boats. So a certain amount of what we're seeing is driven by what's happening in the macro economy. But another part of it is driven by what we are doing to position ourselves to take advantage of these markets as they strengthen. So I'm particularly pleased with industrial, particularly in the automation sector. Dave has talked about A&D and how important Hittite has been to that part of our story. Instrumentation ATE had a good quarter last one as well. So we're well positioned with high-margin, high-value, high-performance products in that area. Automotive, we've talked a lot about. And the foundation of our B2B business is industrial and health care. And both of those areas are performing well, driven by our innovation efforts, our customer engagement efforts and the cooperation of the markets. David Zinsner : And there's, I think, there is a belief by us that the industrial markets are going through a change much like the automotive market has already experienced in this electrification of cars. There is more and more kind of sensor signal processing, these kind of IoT-like applications going into the industrial space. So the unit volume of the end product, whatever that might be, a robotic system or whatever, may be still the same number of units, but the amount of content, analog content and semiconductor content broadly within those systems is just increasing as they try to sense these things and richer ways get better data out of them. Vincent Roche : To that point, our customers are becoming more and more and more software-oriented, and -- which opens up a tremendous opportunity for us as a leader in the application of analog technologies. So the dependence on ADI is increasing where we are essentially, if you like, filling the vacuum for our customers and providing a lot of the analog-engineering solutions to these customers. And as they become more software-oriented in areas like, I mentioned during the prepared remarks here that we have solved a very, very important problem for a customer, where we can take many, many different types of inputs and outputs across various standards where we've been able to do a level of integration in these universal input-output systems, which enable our customers to leverage their software across a bigger swath of analog input-output technologies. So that's some of the stuff that's going as we move towards smarter, more software-oriented machines and process automation and factory automation, for example. Operator : Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah : So I had a question about the B2B outlook for the April quarter. So I thought industrial is typically up 10-plus percent in April, and I think you guys have said that auto's not too dissimilar. So the fact that you're guiding B2B up mid- to high single digits with all the momentum that you're seeing today would sort of suggest that you've got some room to do better. So am I mischaracterizing seasonality? Can you just talk about that a little bit? David Zinsner : Yes. So it's more a function of when you have a really -- when you're coming off such strong numbers in the first quarter, you're probably not going to have quite the sequential improvement in the second quarter. I think it still drives year-over-year growth that's pretty meaningful. So I don't think there's anything really to read into that other than just the growth off of a very strong first quarter drives it to be a little bit lighter, I think, seasonally. Vincent Roche : And remember, we're at record levels in our industrial business. David Zinsner : Right. Operator : Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, 2 quick questions. The first one, can you share -- on the OpEx, you did a great job of managing OpEx and flat revenue environment in fiscal '16. Curious now that revenues appear to be tracking low double digits at least, how we should think about OpEx. And then secondly, now that business is tracking better, free cash flow is coming in stronger, and before, you talked about net leverage of 3.8x at deal close. I would imagine that number would look better and would love to get an update from you on that. David Zinsner : Okay. So on the OpEx front, we're obviously going to lag the revenue growth, probably we will grow at half the rate. Maybe we would do a little bit better. Of course, all this is prior to the Linear Tech integration, and then we'll probably operate in a similar modality after that. As it relates to the net leverage, we'll probably be a little bit better coming -- partially, we also have accumulated a lot of cash in the last couple of quarters, and we're -- we expect to have a pretty good quarter next quarter for cash flow. So I would suspect that we will come in a little bit under what we originally anticipated. I think maybe more importantly is we think the free cash flow is going to be quite strong in this combined business going forward. And so I think we will end up seeing a little bit more rapid paydown of the debt than we originally anticipated. And so in that respect, we should see some benefit on the interest expense line over time and that certainly will benefit earnings as well. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso : Just to follow up on a question on industry conditions and obviously, demand appears pretty favorable now inventory is low. Do you see any evidence either within your own business or the industry of tightening supply conditions, anything that you think would incentivize the customers and distributors to start bringing the inventory levels a bit higher here? David Zinsner : Yes, no, I think when you look across the supply chain as far as we can tell, when we look at our inventory levels and distribution, they're really at the low end of what we expect them to be. When you look at the lead times, we have a goal here of delivering product within 4 to 6 weeks. And we're still delivering basically the entirety of our orders within those stated lead times. So I'd tell you, you always have little pockets here and there, but I'd say overall, things look pretty good. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : I also had a follow up on inventories. You guys mentioned the relatively lean level of 7 weeks that the distribution channels were running at. So I was wondering for your direct customers' sales, which is I think about half of your business, can you talk about how the visibility on those inventories look? And also related to it going back to distribution channel, I think traditionally, people look at distri channel inventory as a good -- sort of real-time or lead indicator of how the overall cycle is doing and further downstream, but with just the better kind of just-in-time manufacture methods and ERP systems, do you guys still think that lower kind of in-line inventory levels in the distri channel still sort of a good lead indicator? David Zinsner : The answer to the second is yes. 50 is an indicator, although at the end of the day, it's the customers' inventory level of the distributors that really matters. We don't have tons of visibility into that. We look at the same data you do, which is what they report in terms of their overall inventory levels, which includes our products but also includes a whole bunch of other suppliers into those customers. And they look in the range of pretty healthy levels so I think that at least as we see it today, there doesn't seem to be anything that would lead you to believe there's an inventory issue out there. I think really how we do and how probably the industry does is more based on how the macro does and how the -- how GDP, world GDP does over the course of the next few years. I'd say that's a bigger determinant of how things go. Operator : Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Richard Sewell : This is Richard in for Harsh. Just wanted to touch on the small cell commentary you had. I know that this has been kind of a well-advertised but continues to kind of get pushed out. What's given you confidence that this is picking up? What are you hearing from customers? And then how does your content look compared to your traditional wireless infrastructure market? David Zinsner : Well, we're getting orders so that's how we know that it's -- the small cell is starting to deploy. It's more than just commentary. This is actually we're getting physical orders and forecast. So I think we feel pretty confident unless some -- there was some end-demand perturbation or something like that. The content is good. It's reasonably similar to what we see on the macro side on a per-radio basis. The difference is that macro base station could have 16, 24 channels and there's only one channel usually for one small cell. So the idea there is that there'll just be a whole lot more of them deployed in a given region or given area, and that's where we make it up in volume. Vincent Roche : Yes, I'd say the ramp-up of small cell is really beginning to happen now. But I think it will hit a different phase over the next year, 2 years. So it will be a bigger factor in 2 or 3 years' time, but our business is still pretty much dominated by macrocell right now. But as Dave said, the channel ASP, the per channel ASP is about the same, whether it's a small cell or a macrocell. Ali Husain : Yes, I'd just add, as Vince mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a record quarter this quarter in our software-defined integrated transceiver platforms. And actually, a lot of that was driven by these small cells deployments that were taking place, I'd say, particularly in China right now. Operator : Our final question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : I just had one last follow-up, and this is on automotive. So instead of looking at sort of the relative growth rates the last year, is there a way for you to talk about dollar content especially with the Linear acquisition? So what I'm trying to get is perhaps maybe now the content is sort of in the tens of dollars but then with Linear Technology, you'll eventually be in the hundreds of dollars? Vincent Roche : Well, the LT -- again look, we have a huge range of ASPs per car, given the type of technology we deployed, how much of it gets deployed per car. LT -- so we have -- ADI's business is spread across basically gas-driven cars, combustion engines as well as EV and hybrid, LTE's is largely electric and hybrid. So it gives us greater diversity but it depends very much on the type of car, the brand of car. So it's very, very hard to put a number on it, Tore, but it's certainly -- we get more diversification, more ASP coverage virtually in every car that we supply technology to. David Zinsner : I would say we did like a quick back of the napkin on it, and I think on the low end, we would get somewhere in the $55 range per car. And on the high end, we could do as well as $500. But if we add Linear to the mix, they should add about $100 worth of content, at least from a SAM perspective. Now obviously, we don't win all that business at every car but -- so it's quite strong. Ali Husain : Great. All right, for sure. Okay, great call, a great quarter. Hopefully, we'll talk to you guys in the road. That was definitely our last question. Thanks for joining the call this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon. Vincent Roche : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain : All right, good morning, and thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the Analog Devices Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. So let's get through our disclosures. Note the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Our commentary about ADI's second quarter financial results are adjusted for special items. When comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also adjusted in the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules, which we've posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com.  As many of you know, we've completed the Linear Tech acquisition about halfway through our fiscal second quarter. And so we've included reconciliations in our Investor page that provide a greater level of detail into our stand-alone and combined results for the quarter. But at a high level, I'll say that Linear contributed $208 million to our non-GAAP second quarter revenue. This number includes $60 million of purchase accounting adjustments that were made for U.S. GAAP purposes and relate to Linear Tech inventory that was in the distribution channel in North America and Japan when we closed the acquisition.  At the end of the second quarter, there remains an additional $30 million of Linear inventory in the distribution channel, which we expect will be sold in its entirety in the third quarter. We've included this adjustment in our non-GAAP revenue expectations for the third quarter and no such adjustments are anticipated starting in the fourth quarter. And then the last point I'll make, and it's information you should be mindful of, is that the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 will be a 14-week quarter.  Okay. So with all that behind us, about to get the show on the road. I'll turn it over to ADI CEO Vincent Roche. Vince's comments on the second quarter are for stand-alone ADI unless he specifies otherwise. And our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter relates to the combined company.  Okay. Vince, all yours. Vincent Roche : Thank you very much, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Well, it's been a very busy period for ADI, and I'm pleased to share our results with you. Not only were our second quarter financial results stellar, but we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech in March, and our integration work is going very well.  So let's start with our financial results for the second quarter. ADI's stand-alone revenue came in at $1 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 28% increase over the prior year. These results were above our revised guidance on broad-based strength, and we continue to see signs of a good business environment, particularly in the industrial market.  Gross margins expanded to 67.6%, which was above the high end of our guidance and the combination of higher sales, higher gross margins and tight control over operating expenses helped expand operating margins to a robust 36% of sales.  In addition free cash flow margins, as a combined company, were also strong at 39% of revenue in the second quarter. As Ali mentioned, Linear Tech was part of ADI for about half the quarter and contributed $208 million in sales on a non-GAAP basis. And we are looking forward to a full quarter's contribution in our third quarter. Now let me give you some details of our performance by end market during the quarter. Note that my remarks relate only to stand-alone ADI. The industrial market at 46% of sales grew 15% sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter and continued its year-over-year growth trajectory, increasing 20% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was broad-based across all industrial sectors and indeed regions.  While business conditions are certainly more positive than they were at this point last year, our success is also the result of smart R&D investments across diverse industrial applications within factory automation, instrumentation, aerospace and defense, and health care. Over several decades, ADI has carved out a leadership position in high performance signal processing, serving our tens of thousands of industrial customers where applications demand the highest levels of performance both in terms of signal chain and in terms of power optimization.  In the near term, our industrial customers are excited to gain access to the highly complementary portfolios of ADI and Linear Tech and are even more excited at the future value-creation opportunities made possible by our combination. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the second quarter and grew 8% sequentially and 9% over the prior year. Both sequential and year-over-year growth was broad-based across all automotive application areas and was strongest in safety and ADAS applications, while powertrain revenue increased but at a slower pace. We supply thousands of products into dozens of automotive subapplications and are gaining more dollar content as we further automate and electrify. The combination with LT dramatically strengthens our technology offerings in this market and expands additional dollar content opportunities across our very complementary customer base. The communications infrastructure market, at 18% of sales, grew 5% sequentially and 4% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth in this market was led by wireless infrastructure applications where we're making very good progress with our RF and microwave and high-speed signal processing and integrated transceiver solutions. While we are, of course, only in the very early stages of 5G cellular infrastructure deployment, we believe that our optimized radio signal processing and power management solutions will be a very key driver of growth as channel counts increase and customers move to phased array antennas to make the most efficient use of available spectrum with the highest reliability and performance.  Of course, the wireless infrastructure market is one where Linear largely didn't play, and thus, this market represents an opportunity to drive revenue synergies in the medium term. On a year-over-year basis, communications infrastructure growth was led by the wireline sector where ADI's customers are benefiting from our precision clocking, timing and control technologies in 100 gig and beyond optical networking applications. And finally, consumer market revenues at 21% of sales decreased 24% sequentially as prosumer applications revenue increased and portable applications revenue came in better than planned. Compared to the prior year, both prosumer and portable applications revenue increased.  So while our combined financial results were excellent, our near and long-term outlooks are equally bright. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech, creating the high-performance analog market leader. As we said from the beginning, we're taking a best-of-both approach, combining the best from ADI and LTC to come up with a new operating system to drive long-term profitable growth for our combined company, and I'm very pleased with the progress we've already made. We're optimizing processes across our selling, new product development, manufacturing and operations activities.  On the sales side, the integration of our 2 sales forces has brought with it a tremendous degree of excitement, and we've already identified many sales synergy opportunities. On the engineering side, our teams have come together at remarkable speed and have begun identifying product road map combinations that we expect, over the long term, will accelerate our growth. On the manufacturing side, our teams have been focused on ensuring that we meet the upside demand and continue to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. Overall our $150 million cost synergy target within 18 months of the acquisition is firmly on track. To give you some background, during the integration planning phase, the vast majority of actions needed to realize the synergy target were identified. And while many of the related actions have already been taken, we're only in the early stages of seeing the benefits of those synergies in our P&L.  In addition, we expect non-GAAP EPS accretion in our first full quarter as a combined company to be 15%, and we expect earnings accretion to accelerate into fiscal 2018 as we begin to more fully realize the synergies from the transaction.  So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the second quarter. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Vince. Good morning, everybody. Since the acquisition of Linear Tech occurred about halfway through our second quarter, Linear Tech's contributions to ADI's results were limited to approximately 7 weeks, and my prepared remarks will exclude Linear's results and other special items unless I specify otherwise. Note that a schedule reconciling our stand-alone and combined performance can be found on our Investor page at investor.analog.com and a reconciliation of our combined GAAP performance to our combined non-GAAP performance can be found in schedules E and F of today's earnings release. So revenue in the second quarter increased to $1 billion, growing 2% sequentially and 28% over the prior year and was above our revised guidance. Sequential revenue growth was led by our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, which, in the aggregate, grew 11% sequentially and, importantly, 14% over the prior year. Gross margins in the second quarter were 67.6%, up 150 basis points from the 66.1% we achieved in the prior quarter, primarily the result of higher utilization rates.  Days of inventory increased 3 days to 104 days and dollars of inventory increased $12 million sequentially as we increased production to match strong demand. Deferred revenue for shipments into distribution increased 6% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were at 7 weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expense of $318 million increased 4% sequentially due to the natural lift from higher activity in the second quarter as compared to the first and higher variable compensation in the second quarter as our bonus program responded to better year-over-year revenue growth and operating profit in the quarter. As a result, operating margins of 36% of sales expanded 500 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth, higher gross margins and prudent expense management by the team.  So now for P&L line items below the operating margin line, I'll talk to results on a combined company basis, excluding special items, outlined in today's release. Other expense in the second quarter was $59 million, the result of a partial quarter with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $70 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million per quarter thereafter. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 10%, and that's the rate we expect for the remaining 2 quarters of the year. We are also planning for a non-GAAP tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 15%, so note that'll be higher than the 10% rate this year.  Our diluted share count increased in the quarter due to the equity consideration related to the acquisition. Since this is a weighted average calculation, the diluted share count in 2Q increased to 346 million shares, and we expect diluted share count in the third quarter, which will be our first full quarter as a combined company, to be approximately 375 million shares. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2017 was $1.03. The second quarter was also a very strong free cash flow quarter. As a combined company, we generated $475 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And for the reported trailing 12 months, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which translates to free cash flow margins of 37%. Now this level of free cash flow generation is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it reflects the strength of our business model and our brand. Second, it means that our EBITDA generation was also very strong. And this means that we're better positioned from a leverage ratio standpoint at the current time than we had communicated to you earlier. So as a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio based on reported combined company results is, in fact, approximately 3x, which is significantly lower than the 3.8x net debt to EBITDA number that we'd estimated when we announced the deal.  So moving to capital additions, which in the second quarter were $47 million for the combined company and are planned to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million for the year here in 2017. During the quarter, we also paid $139 million in dividends, and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock payable on June 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 9. And that represents an annual dividend payment to shareholders of $1.80 per share.  Okay. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which again is on a combined company basis and excludes special items outlined in today's release. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Ali. After a strong second quarter performance, we're planning for a continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and for revenue to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. By end market, we're planning for continued sequential revenue growth in industrial and for the communications end market to remain stable to the prior quarter.  In automotive, we anticipate that seasonal trends will prevail, which would suggest a mid-single digit sequential decline in the third quarter. In the consumer market, we're planning for modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter.  We expect gross margins to be between 69% and 70% as we keep utilization levels stable to their second quarter rates and benefit from higher industrial revenue mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be between $430 million and $440 million. Notably this translates into an operating margin range of 38% to 40% in the third quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.21.  While we continue to see good business conditions, we're always pragmatic and cautious in how we manage our business and in how we convert our precious resources into free cash flow. On this point, with the combination complete, ADI's free cash flow margin now ranks within the top 5% of the S&P 500. At our Investor Day on June 20, we'll outline our plan to drive the long-term profitable growth for ADI, leveraging the customer value-creation capabilities of our innovation and business diversity and our focus on best-in-class operational efficiencies to continue to drive our free cash flow to even higher levels. So with that, we're ready now to take your questions. Ali Husain : All right. Thanks, Vince. So before we get to the Q&A session, just a couple of quick housekeeping items for me. So note that we'll be hosting an Investor Day on June 20. It's accessible via live webcast. I invite you all to tune in on June 20 to hear more about our long-term strategy and the new financial model for the company.  And so let's get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. So operator, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I had a medium-term question, Ali, and maybe you could answer that. And then I had a longer-term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how -- and when I say medium term, I'm thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain : Okay. Sure, thanks, Ambrish. Look, I guess, what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn, that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I'd say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets, is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I'd say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you've seen that strategy play out over the last couple years. We've grown our consumer business nicely. It's generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We've diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We've diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter life cycles. And so as a result, you can have periods of time where you've got some older designs that are rolling off and there's a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we're likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I'd expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess the only other point I would make is, just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is the -- each -- we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different life cycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough problems to solve for customers, and we can drive a lot of free cash flow and, frankly, if we're meeting our hurdle rates, and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth and free cash flow, we'll play. Because ultimately that's the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks, we're now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator : Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then, I guess, as my main question, just a follow-up on Ambrish's question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar '17 and '18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer? Or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain : Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So I think on the revenue side, we provided combined company guidance for both companies. And the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. That would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess, if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect -- the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we're expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid-single digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we're expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So as a result, that would decline kind of in the mid-single digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche : Yes, I think, as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter life cycles in the consumer market. And we've been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base and the application base within consumer, and we're making good progress at that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we're seeing modest sequential revenue growth but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we're probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near term here. Ali Husain : And I'd say, C.J., if I could just add 2 points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we've talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018, and I think that would be a very strong result. Operator : Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Given the stronger industrial demand pull and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I'm just -- it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilizations but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation. Ali Husain : Yes, on the supply side -- no, thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, our -- we're delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn't changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is, at ADI, we're very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support, and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we're going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make on this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI, or days of inventory, down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs. Because as we're building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks, and we're keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur : No, I'm good. Ali Husain : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Question for Vince. I just want to follow up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is? If there's any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche : Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we've talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77 gigahertz radar -- LIDAR, infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotational and linear sensing magnetic devices and, as the powertrain electrifies, being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complementary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I've just talked about here, we're adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the subapplications here for the automotive customers. And the -- there's great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that's looking very, very good. And also, there's a lot of new power management things that we're looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So as I said, there's a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application in which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. So -- and what I'm seeing so far is a tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams in really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Craig, did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach : Yes, I guess, just a brief one, just on the integration. Good to hear that it's on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and any kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche : Well, we've known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I've been obviously hands-on involved in the integration of the 2 companies. I'm very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT, and I'm also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we're laser-focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out -- and we're being been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership -- we've combined the leadership teams, but we're being very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question very directly here, Craig, we're culturally I think in good shape. Our values, as I've talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we're actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies -- to draw from, to create something greater than the sum of the parts. So we're focused, as I said, on delighting our customers, ensuring that we're capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall, the -- once the values are compatible, as I said, I'm using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I've got 2 members of the senior LTC staff on my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Operator : And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ali Husain : You're back. Good. Ambrish Srivastava : I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason, I got dropped off. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow. It seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the paydown? Obviously, the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close. So any light on that would be very helpful. Ali Husain : Okay, fair enough. I'll leave the key takeaway for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is, since we announced the acquisition, there's a couple of things. One is, we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And in typical ADI fashion, we put out targets, and we execute extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is, look, business conditions have been better, and as a result, we've generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that's driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news, I guess, from a leverage perspective as we've talked about is we're certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the deleveraging plan. The bogey we're shooting for is 2x net debt-to-EBITDA, and I'd say we're probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we've been pretty public in terms of saying, look, we're going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile, the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I'd make is -- and again this kind of supports the notion that we're ahead of schedule is, after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we're certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Operator : Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : So the industrial market is growing very strongly. I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year. How much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks, Tore. I think it's true to say that, first off, we're recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad-based across all the industrial sectors and, in fact, across all the geographies as well. And I think that's just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you -- just paying attention to our own customers as well, they're all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector, in general, we're beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we're also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain : Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market. I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because, certainly, that's a market that's been weaker the last few years. But assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Tore. Well, we're-- as ADI organic, we've been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we're being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LT's power technology. And that's only the beginning because, over the coming generations, when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there's no doubt there's tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and -- with existing products, and we're now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the 2 companies. Operator : Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : I'm hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however, maybe they're not as great as some people perceive. But I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business' revenue growth, and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I'm wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business. Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a good question. It's true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it's a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you're developing, the price you can command and, ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just -- given our buying power and our operational focus, we have combined now with LT, we've got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just given the signings of the so-called bill of materials that we're now sourcing across both companies. So we don't intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that's the way to think about it. Ali Husain : And did you have a follow-up, Will? William Stein : I did. One of the issues with the integration that's always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category, maybe a sign that perhaps that's going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis? And just, in general, the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain : Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP's perspective, and frankly from an integration perspective, we're generally keeping Linear Tech on a stand-alone basis for the first year. And then we'll converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn't feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter, and I can certainly talk to it right now on the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end market mapped out, and that's absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow, and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there, I'd say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter that automotive will be pretty seasonal. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how -- if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain : Yes, okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit, and maybe Vince can help me as well. But look, from a -- Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do, and seasonally speaking, industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard, just frankly, depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So that's all I can tell you today with absolutely 0 visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side, and actually, it's a fair point, is on a stand-alone basis this quarter, ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess, I'd caution you on that number. One is, obviously it's a stub period, and so it's a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we've always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run rate that we've guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the come. We'll start to see some of them. It'll be very back-end loaded, though, Chris, in the third quarter, but you'll start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I'd expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we've always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies and achieving that run rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I'm saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run rate number, and there's still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number, as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Christopher Danely : Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain : Of course. Christopher Danely : Any update on the CFO -- new CFO? Vincent Roche : Well, let me tell you, Chris, we've -- obviously, we've retained the search firm. And what I can tell you is that we're making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we'll have a replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I'm quite optimistic that we'll be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I'm taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I'm also relying -- we've a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So we can -- we're very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So synergies are on track, and we'll update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Operator : Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess, just a question on the Linear side. You've had this under your belt for a few months now. So I'm curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche : Yes, well, I think as we've talked about earlier on, the various markets all have different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say in the -- it's the medium term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products, it's probably a 2- to 3-year proposition as we've experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium term here will be automotive, for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium term. Very judiciously, as well, we're looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that's the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain : Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani : Got it. I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple years, it's been triple digit-ish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it's due later product launch in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs will have more comfort around your ability to ram these products, so they're asking you to do it a little bit later? But it seems to be a fairly big delta versus what you've seen the last [ 2 ] years at least. Perhaps help explain what's driving that? Ali Husain : So I guess, I'll take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I'd say, more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent, and we just think we'll have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I'd say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix -- our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Operator : Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : Congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new era with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It's clear, Vincent, that the company's quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is, does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the 2 companies? Vincent Roche : No. I think when we've talked about synergies, we've been very clear that we've acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management, channel management, operations and so on, to drive revenue synergy over the long term. But -- no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making. We've -- we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it'll take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that, I think, as I've just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain : Great, Craig. Another follow-up? Craig Ellis : Yes, thanks for that, Ali. And I'll follow-up on end market communications. Vincent, I think you've mentioned 5G a couple times. And it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes. But with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G-related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Vincent Roche : Yes, I think your point is well taken. I think originally, when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we're obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we'll begin to see, I think, a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it's a little sooner. Maybe it's a little later, but that's my sense at this point in time that there's an aggressive pull-in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Operator : Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra : You had mentioned that you recently that you've seen the small cell business finally picking up. What's your market share in that business, which I'm assuming has been fairly small, and what type of growth are we looking? And what type of revenue contribution could we get, let's say, in the next 12 to 18 months? Ali Husain : Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I'm sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I'd say on the small cell side, it's been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess, what we're particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell. That could be a macro base station. But we're doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of a record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly, you saw our results this quarter. And again, it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure, and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I'd make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about 2/3 of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it's more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology, and we're pretty agnostic as to form factor. We've got the products, and I think really it's a question of, as the market percolates, we're going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche : Yes, I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We're very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate somewhat during the course of the next 12 to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain : See you answered it better than I would. Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra : Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close. Could you provide some color on what's been driving that growth? Has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies? And the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you've gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you've done with Hittite? Vincent Roche : Okay. Let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think, with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI -- one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach -- the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had that Hittite didn't have, so we've been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio of products was very, very strong, so that's been a huge help to us. Obviously, we've been able to architect. We've been together now almost 3 years, and we've been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these days, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation, where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So I think it's -- it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI's signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite's Microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain : How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche : So, leverage to Linear. I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world-class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we've taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world-class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than the sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That's what we did with Hittite, and that's what we're doing with LTC times 5. Ali Husain : Thanks for the question. And we're zooming into the 11 :00 hour here, so we're going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can't, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at (781) 461-3282. So we'll continue until 11. Operator : Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. But what about on the $50 million in COGS? Can you give us a feeling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance? Where might we see that by the end of the year? And should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you're suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain : Yes, I'd say on the gross margin side, we're very early in the process. I'd say those are all very much on the come. I wouldn't expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, so it doesn't sound like you're quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved may be easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more in? Vincent Roche : Well, clearly we've been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That's one of the things that's been executed pretty much straightaway. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI, and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the -- and obviously distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before, that will start to show benefits to us I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So they're just 3 or 4 examples of the things that we've already got in play that we'll start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we've got the actions in place, and we're now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain : And Stacy, I would just add, we've talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking in some of these synergies into 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the analyst meeting. All right, I think we just hit the 11 :00 hour. So listen, thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the quarterly results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com. So thank you again for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you -- many of you next month. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.  I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain : All right. Great. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning to everybody on the line here. Thanks for joining the Analog Devices Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call.  First, I'd like to get through our disclosures. Note that the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Today's commentary about ADI's third quarter financial results will include non-GAAP financial measures. When comparing our third quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and in our web schedules, which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com. Our web schedules also include a historical view of what the combined ADI and Linear Tech would have looked like by end market, by quarter for the last 3 years.  And lastly, please note that ADI's first quarter of fiscal '18 will be a 14-week quarter so you should adjust your models for an additional week of revenue and additional week of expenses for that quarter.  And so with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince's comments are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude special items outlined in today's release. So with that, Vince, it's all yours. Vincent Roche : Thanks very much, Ali, and good morning, everyone.  Well, this is another very successful quarter for ADI, and I'm pleased to share our results with you this morning. Not only were our third quarter financial results stellar, we're also making excellent progress in integrating Linear Tech from an organization and a synergy capture perspective.  So let's start with our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenue was above the high end of guidance at $1.46 billion, primarily on broad-based strength in the highly diverse industrial markets. And this strong revenue growth, coupled with disciplined operational execution, delivered gross margins of 70.5% and operating margins of 40.5%. Importantly, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of adjusted free cash flow over the past 12 months with associated margins of 34%, which are among the highest in the S&P 500.  Now, I'd like to give you some details on our performance by end market during the quarter. The industrial market represented 49% of sales and demand across all industrial sectors and regions was strong. ADI's industrial business is now nearing a $3 billion annual run rate and we see numerous opportunities to drive additional dollar content and revenue growth as customers increasingly rely on ADI to make their applications more intelligent, more connected and more efficient. For example, in factory automation, our software configurable I/O solution is making the factory floor more flexible and configurable. The value creation opportunity is highly compelling. Customers have the potential to save more than $2 million per typical installation and factory downtime during line changeovers can be reduced by more than 8 weeks. As the factory floor further automates, ADI's opportunity in the area of robotics doubles with the addition of sensing, signal processing, power delivery and connectivity. A new application such as in collaborative robotics expand our available market by around $300 million over the next 5 years.  Switching now to automotive. This market represented 16% of revenue and increased over the prior year. ADI's dollar content opportunity in a vehicle today is approximately $250, but we believe we can more than double this by 2025 from emerging megatrends such as autonomous driving and the electrification of the powertrain. For autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, ADI's 77 gigahertz radar solution delivers the highest levels of resolution and sensitivity, increasing spatial accuracy by a factor of 8 while making the radar 3x smaller. In addition, the desire to make cars more energy-efficient is driving the electrification of the vehicle powertrain. Here, ADI's battery management products are 3x more accurate than competing solutions, enabling more miles per battery charge.  The communications infrastructure market totaled 18% of sales in the third quarter. By application area, sequential strength in wireline offset a slower wireless sector. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave and high-speed signal processing, coupled with power, is unmatched in breadth and depth with products that span the entire frequency spectrum to 100 gigahertz and beyond. For example, our software-defined radio transceivers dramatically simplify the base station radio card through aggressive integration and software configuration. This solution enables higher channel density and reduces our customers' time-to-market. Today, ADI solutions are pervasive in 5G field trials and we are well-positioned to benefit from the wave of 5G deployments that we believe will begin in 2019.  The consumer market represented 17% of sales in the third quarter, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year across prosumer and portable consumer applications. We've built a strong consumer franchise that focuses on solving our customers' toughest engineering challenges, providing them with a high level of differentiation and, in turn, driving very strong profitability and free cash flow for ADI. So in summary, this was an excellent quarter and we believe that we are better positioned than ever to drive long-term profitable growth and free cash flow.  So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the quarter. Ali Husain : Okay. Thanks, Vince, and good morning, again, everyone.  Before we move to the quarterly results, please note that with the exception of nonoperating expense, my comments on the P&L line items exclude special items outlined in today's release and our web schedules can be found on the IR page. Okay. So as Vince just outlined, this was another really solid quarter for ADI with all line items of the P&L exceeding the high end of our guidance range on very strong business performance and operational execution. So total revenue increased to $1.46 billion with a $393 million contribution from Linear Technology. ADI's standalone revenue increased 6% sequentially and 23% over the prior year and this reflected strong and broad-based demand, particularly in the industrial market.  Gross margins in the third quarter were 70.5%, above our guidance range, primarily on a higher industrial revenue mix and cost synergy capture. Dollars of inventory increased $40 million sequentially as we ramped production to match strong demand, but on a days basis, inventory was stable at around 106 days.  Deferred revenue for shipments into distribution increased 11% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were, again, at 7 weeks, which has been very consistent over many, many quarters now.  Operating expenses in the third quarter were $437 million or 30% of revenue and, as a result, operating margins expanded to 40.5%, which was above the high end of guidance.  Nonoperating expense in the third quarter was $68 million, reflecting a full quarter of interest expense with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. Our expectation is for nonoperating expense to be approximately $65 million, both in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the 14-week first quarter of 2018, and to decrease to $55 million to $60 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal '18. Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 10.8%. We expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% and for it to be approximately 15% in 2018.  Diluted share count increased to 371 million shares in the third quarter, primarily due to the equity consideration relating to the acquisition. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of '17 was $1.26. That was $0.05 above the high end of guidance. During the quarter, we completed a restructuring of our legal entities related to the Linear Tech acquisition. This resulted in a onetime cash payment of $750 million. Excluding this item, ADI generated $322 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and $1.9 billion for the combined company on a trailing 12-month basis.  During the quarter, we paid down $600 million of the debt associated with the Linear Tech acquisition, which helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.9x. We expect to pay down our debt at a rate of approximately $1 billion per year and are planning to achieve a 2x net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio by the first half of fiscal 2019. Once we achieve this leverage ratio, we plan to reinstitute or reinstate our share buyback program and target an overall cash return to shareholders of 80% to 100% after debt service.  So moving on to fixed asset additions, which in the third quarter were $64 million for the combined company and are planned to be approximately $200 million for fiscal '17. And this is probably a good opportunity to also point out that our model is for CapEx to run at approximately 4% of revenue on an ongoing basis.  During the quarter, we also paid $166 million in dividends and, earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock payable on September 19 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 8. And that dividend payment now represents $1.80 per share annualized dividend payment. Okay. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Vince for our outlook for the fourth quarter of '17, which exclude special items outlined in today's release. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Ali.  After a strong third quarter, we're planning for revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion. By end market, we're planning for the industrial and communications infrastructure sectors to be approximately flat sequentially and for the automotive and consumer markets to grow from their third quarter levels. Gross margins are expected to remain stable at approximately 70.5% as cost synergies offset the anticipated mix of revenue. Operating expenses are estimated to be down 3% to flat sequentially. At the midpoint of this guidance, these inputs translate into an operating expense ratio of approximately 29% and operating margins of approximately 42% in the fourth quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.43.  As you likely saw as well, we recently announced our new CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, who will be joining us at the end of September. I'm really looking forward to Prashanth's arrival and getting the benefit of his strategic insight and strong operational focus as we continue our long-term customer and shareholder value creation journey.  We believe that our organization, portfolio and customer relationships have never been in better shape and our technology never more essential to an ever more connected and intelligent world. Our operating model calls for some of the highest margins in our industry and, indeed, in the S&P 500. Operating margins that are in the range of 39% to 45% and free cash flow margins in the range of 34% to 42%. And we're only getting started. So with that, we will take your questions. Ali Husain : Okay. Thanks, Vince.  So let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] So operator, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : My first question is perhaps a bit more longer term for you, Vince. But as we now look at ADI, Linear and Hittite combined, can you give us any examples on how that combination really strengthens your barriers to entry? I mean, I know you're obviously working on a lot of new products with the 3 combined, but if you can give us any insight into how that positions ADI from a competitive perspective, that would be great. Vincent Roche : Yes, Tore. Well, if you look across the analog sector, we've now got all the building blocks focused at solving the toughest challenges that our customers face across every facets of -- whether it's sensing, measuring, interpreting, powering the signal chains. And that's the brand that we've been building for several years at ADI, that's the brand that both Hittite and the RF and microwave space and LT and the power and mixed signal space were building as well independently. So under one roof now, we can tackle our customers' toughest challenges, whether it's in communications infrastructure, in autonomous driving, in making our customers' installed factory automation and process control machines more intelligent, more connected. And clearly, that's the brand that we convey to our customers, that's the brand that our customers are buying and engaging with across all these different areas.  So we are investing around now $1 billion of combined R&D across the 3 enterprises under one roof. So we're all the time looking to broaden and deepen our competitive mold and we believe we're in a better position now than ever across all these various markets and with larger customers. And with the addition of LT as well, we now got the chance to directly address more medium-sized and smaller customers directly. Ali Husain : Tore, did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes. So there's -- I have a follow-up on the communications bucket. So obviously, that's been more mixed here the last few quarters. I assume that's more related to wireless infrastructure, but you mentioned 5G coming online and it seems like maybe it's coming online sooner at least than I was thinking. So maybe you could elaborate a little bit on when you start to -- when you expect to start to see more material growth in the communications part of the business? Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, Tore, we are playing in the field trials with virtually everybody today in the 5G area. My sense is that China and perhaps Japan will be first to market with 5G systems. And there are lots of definitions for what 5G really means, but I think the early systems will be massive MIMO-based, more like 4.5 plus, moving up to much higher frequencies over the next 5 years or so into the -- well into the gigahertz, the 20-, 30-gigahertz arena. So my sense is that 2019 is when we're going to see the first deployments in Asia in particular, and Europe and America a little bit longer, I think, to figure out exactly what standards and what frequencies they're going to target and to get into the field trial area. Ali Husain : Yes. And, Tore, I'll just to add, from a positioning standpoint, ADI's particularly well-positioned to benefit from these 5G deployments. Inherently, when you're enabling more bandwidth, you're going to need more radios, and that's really where we focus is on the radio. So the more radios that are out there, the better it is for ADI.  And secondly, as you're moving faster -- to faster speeds and higher standards, you need to move up the frequency spectrum. And so with our addition of the Hittite portfolio, we're particularly well-positioned as we move up the frequency spectrum in areas like microwave and millimeter wave. Operator : Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : In automotive core ADI, I think the team has been driving sort of solid year-over-year growth over the past few quarters. And I think, combined with Linear, you guys drove sort of mid-single digits year-over-year growth in Q3. And then, if I look at Q4, right, that typically tends to be stronger. You guys are guiding for growth, but that would imply sort of a range of sort of anywhere from low single digits to mid-single digits year-over-year growth in Q4. Just given the momentum that you guys have, rising content on new model deployments, should we anticipate that -- embedded within your guidance that auto is probably growing kind of more towards that mid-single digits year-over-year growth range? Ali Husain : Okay. Let me take part of that and maybe for the longer-term piece, I can let Vince answer that.  Okay. So in the quarter, automotive revenues were pretty stable sequentially. They were certainly ahead of the guidance range that we provided investors with. And it really was a tale of 2 cities in the automotive space or 2 businesses, frankly, because while the ADI standalone automotive business did, in fact, decrease in line with seasonality, again, on a sequential basis, the LTC automotive business recovered very, very strongly on a sequential basis. I call that because of a recovery in the powertrain sector specifically in China. So I think when you look at the tale of those 2 businesses combined, you see a pretty stable third quarter result.  On a year-over-year basis, the ADI standalone revenue did grow in the high single digits, but as we point out in the schedule that we provided you, it appears to look like a mid-single-digit growth rate. And again, it's because of the Linear Tech business that's lower on a year-over-year basis around this powertrain business. Again, we're seeing a pretty good recovery in that space right now. So that -- I just want to give you a little bit of color on how the quarter turned out.  In terms of the guidance for next quarter, all we can tell you, Harlan, is what we see in the order book and the order book supports a pretty seasonal fourth quarter. So it could be, on a year-over-year basis, anywhere from kind of the mid-single digits to high single-digit rate.  The one thing I would point out is there's obviously been a lot of noise around SAR and we obviously look at all that information as well and we have access to that data as well as you do. And I'd be perfectly candid with you to tell you that for -- we are Tier 2 suppliers into Tier 1 suppliers who are supplying to OEMs. I think if any semiconductor company sits around and tells you that SAR has a direct impact on their revenue, it's frankly very, very hard for us to tell. All we can tell you is what's in the order book and the order book supports a pretty seasonal quarter in the fourth quarter. Harlan Sur : Great. And then, just a quick follow-up. Same question I had last quarter, which is obviously you guys talked about distribution inventory still being very disciplined on lead times. Again, looking at some of your peers, there appears to be some pockets of products that are seeing tightness of supply. Last quarter, you guys talked about being very comfortable satisfying customer demand within your normal 4 to 6-week lead times. I'm just wondering if that's still the case? Ali Husain : Yes. Good question. We obviously pay a lot of attention to that particularly because it is a customer service commitment that we have. And so absolutely, the lead times have remained very stable at 4 to 6 weeks and really not a whole lot of change there. We do have about 3.5 months worth of inventory on our own balance sheet. We have 7 weeks of inventory in distribution. And I'd say those metrics have been very, very stable. Operator : Our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : My question is on the Linear integration. And it looks like some of the synergies, especially on the margin front, are showing up earlier, but if I were to pick something that, at least to me, doesn't looked that positive is the free cash flow. And I'm not judging you on a quarterly basis. But even if I x out the onetime payment, free cash flow margin looks on the lower side. Could you please address that? Ali Husain : Yes. No, sure. And again, that's a metric that we look at very, very closely as well because even though we're at 34% free cash flow margins on a trailing 12-month basis -- and again, that is probably at the very high end of the S&P 500 -- I think the combination of these 2 businesses and how we think about the future here would suggest that we can really get these free cash flow margins really humming. So even though we're kind of at the high end of the free cash flow spectrum on the S&P 500, in terms of our free cash flow model, we're certainly at the lower end of that, which is 34% to 42% is the range.  So yes, I would just point out, as you mentioned, Ambrish, the -- looking at free cash flow in any one quarter is -- obviously has a lots of puts and takes to it. The third quarter tends to be a quarter that's a seasonally weaker quarter for free cash flow generation. We tend to have a couple of things that go on in the third quarter. So really the compare is to last year. And I think we were at 25% last year and we're probably around 22% this year.  There's a couple of items that are incremental, I guess, this year relative to last in the third quarter. One is we're obviously in a better business environment. And so when you do that, you tend to build inventory and ship inventory to customers, your accounts receivable goes up. Of course, all that converts into cash in the following quarter. But in any event, in the third quarter, we basically saw a use of cash in the working capital section of the free cash flow statement as a result of really better business conditions.  The other item I'd point out relative to last year is we are obviously carrying a debt load related to the acquisition. And related to that debt load, there are 2 really semiannual payments that we need to make related to that debt load. One of those payments falls in the third quarter. So I think you saw a depressed free cash flow number this quarter. It really was kind of the perfect storm for cash flow this quarter. But I think over the longer term, we're very well-positioned to drive our 34% to 42% free cash flow margin model range. Did you have a follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did. And you addressed the auto question that Harlan asked of you. But similarly on industrial -- and on industrial, we don't have any SAR number that we can look at and say, \"Hey, look, SAR is at this and so your business should be doing this.\" How would you characterize what you're seeing in the industrial end market because there's obviously a whole bunch of cross currents there as well? Vincent Roche : Yes. I think, Ambrish, at this point, it's true to say -- I've talked with a lot of our -- the executives at our industrial customers over the last several months. I'd say there is generally optimism. I think people are pragmatic in terms of the CapEx environment, but what I will tell you is that there's a general sense that there's a better -- obviously a better economic environment in America, in particular for laying out CapEx and improving, I would say, the efficiency of the machinery, the installed base. So there's what our customers would call a brownfield upgrade in place. I think as well, China is on the track of mass automation, what they call China 2025, and that's having a huge effect obviously in our business in China and Japan.  So I think, overall, there's strength across all the various sectors, whether it's automation, aerospace and defense or ATE, and all the geos are doing well at this point in time. And I think there's a good balance between the consumption of our products and the supply of our products at this point in time. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : Vince, I wanted to follow-up on a comment that you made in your prepared remarks regarding the automotive business and the potential for ADI content to double from now to the 2025 period. As investors look ahead to the next one to 2 years, where should they expect content to start to increase towards that $500 level from what is $250 now? What are the early signposts that they can look to for an increase in content? Vincent Roche : Yes, Craig. Good question. So obviously, autonomous driving, there are various levels of autonomous driving, but we're moving steadily towards a car that is using predictive safety more and more. So our radar solutions are doing well today and we have a great crop of new products at the very, very high-frequency level with tremendous spatial accuracy and very, very high channel count, so highly integrated. So that's one area where we will get a lot more penetration.  Obviously, we're able to attach the power solutions as well of LT into those areas. So that probably -- between the radar solution itself and the combination with LT, that probably doubles the available market, bringing LT doubles the available socket value for ADI, if you like, in the radar area. We're starting to trial a solid-state LIDAR solution that will start to -- hopefully, in that period of time, over the next 5 years, we'll start to see some significant contribution in terms of revenue there. We've already announced new products that, A2B, for example, that move information around the car very efficiently and very cost-effectively. And we've more generations of that plus new variants of that coming.  On the electrification side, we've built a very attractive sensor portfolio -- magnetic sensor portfolio, for example, for controlling movement in the car and measuring movement in the car with a lot of attached precision signal processing. So those are some examples. And obviously, with the -- on the electrification theme as well, the addition of LT's battery controllers is very exciting to our customers across the globe. And again, there are many ongoing sockets that we've been supplying for many, many years in areas like infotainment, audio, video interface. So all those areas we're building a very, very nice pipeline, which gives us tremendous confidence. Craig Ellis : Great. Ali, the follow-up question is for you. I appreciate the heads-up on the extra week in the fiscal first quarter of next year. As a backdrop to that, can you just help us, as you look at the combined business, what would normal seasonality be for the fiscal first quarter with Linear Tech in the portfolio? Ali Husain : Yes. No, I'd say it's -- that's a good question, Craig. I'd say the ADI B2B markets and the Linear Tech B2B markets probably are pretty similar in terms of how they would behave seasonally. We've also, by the way, put a schedule up on our IR page, which shows 3 years worth of data of what the combined company would have looked like by quarter. So we're also -- you guys can go and calculate the seasonality based on that data as well.  The way to think about the first quarter is, generally speaking, it's a pretty weak quarter. It's a January quarter for ADI so not only do we get the December holidays, but we also get the January holidays that impact that quarter. And generally speaking, it's weaker for industrial and automotive and communications infrastructure as well.  On the consumer side, I think if you kind of back into the fourth quarter guidance that we've given you for consumer, the year-over-year growth rate is down actually. So it's -- and I'd expect that weakness to continue in the first quarter and into the second quarter as well of next year.  But coming back to the point about seasonality in the first quarter, because we are expecting an additional week of revenue in the first quarter, I just tack in an additional week of revenue, additional week of OpEx. And then, the second quarter, generally you see a recovery in the industrial and automotive markets sequentially, although this time my sense is that recovery will probably be a little bit more muted just simply because you get the additional week in the first quarter. And consumer, generally you see a bit of a leg down from its first quarter levels. And then, the third and fourth quarters are, again, seasonally pretty stable for the B2B markets and consumer tends to recover. So that's probably the way to think about 2018 and the impact of the extra week and the 14-week quarter of 1Q '18. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : First question on the consumer segment. It's good to see that it's now less than 20% of sales. But do you think it's at a point where your large portable customer have sort of stabilized somewhat on a content basis so we don't have to worry about any big fluctuations that are content-related? I understand the seasonal swings in consumer, but at what point can we start to finding normal seasonality and not have to worry about content swings at large customers? Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, as we talked about at the Analyst Day there a while ago, we are -- our sense is that our position in the portable space is strong in the areas that we care about. Obviously, the adoption cycles and the life cycles are shorter than in the areas like industrial, for example. So we have to -- there is a dynamic there where we have to fight for sockets continuously. But I think as we pointed out at the Analyst Day, we're expecting a level of stability at a lower run rate, perhaps down, in the portable area, of 20% in the coming year. That's what we're planning for and we're shooting for. And obviously, there may be upside to that, but that's how we think about it at this point in time. Ali Husain : Yes. I'll just add, Vivek. It's obvious. We have really no visibility into what 2018 is going to do in consumer, although we do have a good sense that our content in these devices is pretty platform-specific. And our sense is that, that mix is going to be weaker next year.  As Vince pointed out, frankly, we were asked at the Analyst Day as well, it's just very hard to model that business. And so I've heard estimates from analysts to be down, that business, 20% to 30%. Our sense is that 30% is probably a worse case scenario in the consumer space for next year. Vivek Arya : Got it. Very helpful. And as my follow-up, now that you have achieved your 70%-plus kind of gross margin target, what are the next few milestones? And how should we think about the impact of mix versus utilization versus call synergies from here? Ali Husain : Yes. No, that's a good question. I think, Vivek, it's -- these 70.5% gross margins, 70-plus percent gross margins that we're putting up right now are a function of -- obviously, we're pretty well-utilized in our fabs given the current business conditions. In addition, the industrial market is really driving a lot of growth for us right now and that tends to drive pretty solid margins as well. In addition, we moved pretty early this quarter to capture some cost synergies in the gross margin line and that obviously helped as well.  I think, as we look into next year, if business conditions remain in there, if business conditions are led by the industrial market, we do have more synergies on to come on that gross margin line. We should do better. But again, it's all going to be very much specific to the environment that we're in next year. Vivek Arya : Got it. So even if consumer declines next year, that should be helpful for gross margin line? Ali Husain : Well, I mean, I would say our margins across all of our businesses are actually quite good. So I don't expect that to be a big needle mover. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Vince, one for you back on the industrial side. If I look at your growth year-over-year, I think the combined mix that you guys talked about has it up 27%. I think your guidance is up 10% to 20%, 25% year-over-year. That's really impressive, but almost so much so that I wonder if there's something company-specific going on. Is that -- that number is really about 2x what your competition is doing and much higher than anything you have done yourself in the last 5 years. So, I guess, given that, what's driving such strong growth? And how sustainable do you view that growth rate? Vincent Roche : Yes, Ross. I think there are a number of factors in the response here. Firstly, '16 wasn't a strong year, in particular on the industrial side of things. We have a strong play. We made a pivot as a company several years ago. We pivoted R&D and focus into areas like aerospace and defense. Hittite, obviously, has helped us a lot in the penetration of that space. Our automation business is strong across the globe. We've seen -- China has become a bigger part of what we do in the industrial area. So I think those things have helped us a lot. And obviously, with LT's focus as well, the mix of LT's business being skewed towards heavily B2B applications and particularly industrial, that helps everything. So I think there are a number of factors that are related to just a stronger market and ADI's position within the market. Ali Husain : Yes. And I'd just add to that, Ross. On a year-over-year basis, aerospace and defense and automated test equipment were up very, very strongly. And so we do have this broad base of customers and they've certainly done well as well, but we've also got a couple of these more programmatic areas like I just mentioned that really we're very strong on a year-over-year basis. And we look at these growth rates as well and we say, \"Boy, this is really good growth. I would love to keep this going.\" But our sense is, at least from a supply chain perspective, that things are pretty stable, at least for the things that we can see. And I tend to look at the distie channels, see how that's doing, and that's been like clockwork at 7 weeks every quarter. And we did that again this quarter. So it's the best that we can tell you at this stage. Ross Seymore : Great. I guess, as my follow-up, switching over to the Linear Tech side. I believe last quarter, you talked about having $20 million out of the original $100 million in OpEx synergies already captured. Can you give us an update on what you've captured so far? And then, at your analyst meeting, a similar follow-up. You had -- you added $100 million with a longer time frame and made it a $250 million synergy target. Is that $100 million incremental more on the COGS side or more on the OpEx side? Ali Husain : Okay. Good question. So on the initial $150 million synergy that as, Ross, you point out, there was $20 million of public company costs that came out in the second quarter when we combined the companies. In the third quarter, there was an additional $20 million of synergies that we realized. And in the fourth quarter guidance -- and again, all this is embedded in the guidance -- there's an additional $45 million of cost synergies.  So the way to think about it is by the end of the fourth quarter, we would have realized $85 million of the $150 million. And of that $85 million, the split on the P&L would be approximately 2/3 in the OpEx line and about 1/3 in the cost of sales line. Now, there's still an additional $65 million remaining that we expect to start recognizing ratably in the first quarter of '18 and ending by the fourth quarter of '18. And displayed on that, we expect to be about 2/3 cost of sales and 1/3 OpEx. So that's $150 million locked and loaded. We are obviously recognizing and realizing those synergies a little faster than we perhaps pointed to in the past, but I'll take it. And then, the $100 million of additional synergies that we talked about in the 3 to 5-year time frame, I would say we've identified those areas. I think, naturally, when you put 2 companies together, you're going to have efficiencies that take place and some of those are earlier, some of those are later. And in the 3 to 5-year time frame, we've got those synergies identified. It's just a question of communicating it to The Street and once we have that planned, we'll certainly do it. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. I wanted to follow-up on the automotive side, particularly for BMS. Now that you have Linear's business in-house, just want to get a sense of just kind of design pipeline and how you're viewing that market over the intermediate to longer term. Vincent Roche : A lot of the activity, Craig, over the last couple of years for LT in that space has been in China and Asia in general. There has been an aggressive shift to penetrate the market as well in the U.S. and merging in Europe as well. So I would say given the pipeline, given the products that we have and given the penetration that we've got into some new areas as well, I think over the next 5 years it would be a significant growth contributor for ADI. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. And then, just want to follow-up on the CFO hire. Understanding Prashanth will be starting at the end of September, but just maybe just taking a step back and, Vince, if you could just shed light on kind of your process, how you evaluate different types of candidates and why you think he was the best fit for you? Vincent Roche : Yes. So first and foremost, I was looking for a very seasoned CFO with an understanding of the technology environment. In fact, Prashanth ticks all of those boxes. He's been in the world of technology for a quarter of a century. He's a chemical engineer by background. So I think -- and his track record has proven that he can run complex financial operations. And what I'm looking for is somebody to obviously run the financial operation of ADI flawlessly, make sure that we integrate LTC flawlessly and as well work with myself and the leadership team here at ADI to look for areas of trapped value that we can unlock in the years ahead. So I think as well Prashanth will be -- he will be a great cultural fit for ADI. And so we're obviously very excited to have him come on board in the next few weeks. And I think we have a world-class CFO now coming on board and with a great future ahead of us that he would help us unlock. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess, a couple of questions. One, on the automotive side. I realize you guys are guiding for a seasonal recovery or improvement in the upcoming quarter. But given the improvement you're seeing in the powertrain side at Linear, which is a legal part of the revenue, why do you think growth is not better than seasonal trends in the upcoming quarter on automotive? Ali Husain : Yes. Amit, I would just point out all we can tell you is what we see in our order book and the order book supports the kind of guidance that we provided. Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani : I do. I guess, just on the gross margin side, you guys had really impressive upside on gross margins this quarter in July, but as I look at October, you guys are kind of guiding flat gross margins despite revenues improving and the potential of Linear benefit. So beyond mix, I guess, what are the headwinds that might be there for gross margins in October? Ali Husain : Yes. So I think Vince mentioned it in his prepared remarks. We expect our growth in the fourth quarter to be led by the automotive and consumer markets. And those 2 markets tend to carry, again, very good gross margins, but they're slightly dilutive to the overall company. And so as a result, actually I think the great result that we can keep gross margin stable next quarter despite the mix or the anticipated mix. And the way we're going to do that is to realize more of the cost synergies like we talked about before.  All righty. Thanks, Amit. Okay. So everybody, thanks for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.  So thank you very much for dialing in and have a great Labor Day, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain : Okay. Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our conference call. You can find our press release and relating financial schedules at the usual place at investor.analog.com. With me on the call today are ADI CEO, Vincent Roche; ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah; and Mike Lucarelli from Investor Relations.  First, let's get through our disclosures. Note that the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Today's commentary about ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal '17 financial results will be detailed further in our 10-K, which we expect to file over the next few days.  In addition, note that ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal '17 financial results and short-term outlook will include non-GAAP financial measures when comparing our results to our historical performance. Special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and in our web schedules, which we have posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com. Our web schedules also include a historical view of what the combined ADI and Linear Tech would have looked like by end market, by quarter for the last 3 years. And lastly, please note that our outlook for ADI's first quarter fiscal '18 includes an additional week, so fiscal 1Q '18 will be a 14-week quarter and is expected to include 1 normal week of revenue expense.  Okay. So with that, I'll turn it over to ADI CEO, Vincent Roche. With the exception of fourth quarter revenue, Vince's comments about our financial results are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude special items outlined in today's release and in our web schedules.  Okay, Vince, it's all yours. Vincent Roche : Thank you, Ali, and a very good morning, everyone. I'd like to firstly welcome Prashanth to ADI. This is, as you know, Prashanth's first quarter as our CFO, and I'm really delighted to have him join ADI.  Turning to the quarter. The fourth quarter fiscal 2017 was another very successful quarter for ADI, and I'm pleased to share our results with you this morning. Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $1.54 billion and was above the midpoint of guidance as the communications and consumer markets led our sequential growth, while the industrial and automotive markets were stable to the prior quarter. Our strong overall revenue performance, coupled with disciplined operational execution, expanded gross and operating margins and drove diluted earnings per share to $1.45, which was above the high end of our guidance. And I'll provide you with a historical perspective.  Over the last 5 years, ADI has doubled its revenue base to $5.2 billion, expanded operating margins by over 900- basis points to approximately 40% and nearly tripled free cash flow generation on a combined company basis to $1.9 billion or 34% of sales, which is within the top 5% of all S&P 500 companies. From a strategic perspective, 2017 was a watershed year as we completed the acquisition of LTC, further deepening and widening our competitive moat, expanding our capabilities in high-value signal processing and power management applications and giving ADI the ability to more completely serve the ever-expanding needs of our more than 100,000 customers. ADI is now able to solve customer problems from sensor to cloud, from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nanowatts to kilowatts with a leading market position in all product segments.  Fiscal 2017 was also marked by strong execution across our portfolio of products and customers. For example, in the industrial market, which represented 46% of revenue in fiscal '17, our battery formation and test equipment solutions experienced both cyclical and secular growth as we gained additional dollar content in our customer systems and added new customers in this expanding market, which is forecasted to grow 5x by 2022.  The factory automation sector also grew strongly during the year as customers made both brownfield and greenfield upgrades to manufacturing equipment. Here, ADI's technology solutions are enabling value creation for our customers by helping reduce plant downtime, boost productivity and make manufacturing more flexible and configurable. In health care applications, our optical sensor-based solutions also grew strongly over the prior year led by vital signs monitoring and imaging applications.  In the automotive market, which represented 15% of revenue in fiscal 2017, we made excellent progress on the promise of autonomous driving with new innovations in radar technology, where our solutions provide superior range and resolution capability beyond anything available in the market today. And in automotive infotainment applications, we hit an important milestone for our A2B audio bus solution, surpassing 1 million units shipped in the year across platforms of many automotive OEMs, including Ford.  The communications market represented 18% of revenue in fiscal '17. Within this market, we have experienced a tenfold revenue increase over the past 4 years for our software-defined radio solutions, which have become the market leader from macrocell, massive MIMO and small cell. The consumer market represented 21% of revenue for the year and also grew strongly, led by portable applications.  As we often say, luck favors the prepared minds, and we've been preparing and investing for this moment for many, many decades. And across our business, we are creating, capturing and retaining value by leveraging our culture of innovation to solve our customers' biggest and most pressing challenges.  Building on a very strong 2017, we believe we can continue to drive long-term profitable growth by investing at the cutting edge to grow our core franchises and by extending our reach with our customers.  So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to ADI's new CFO, Prashanth. In his short time here, Prashanth has hit the ground running, providing me and the organization with his keen strategic insights. And I'm very confident that with his operational focus and financial discipline, we will increase shareholder value further. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm very excited to be joining Analog Devices and to be joining Vince's leadership team. This is a company with tremendous legacy of innovation, and I look forward to helping to drive the business and deliver against our long-term financial model.  In my 8 weeks here, I've been deeply impressed with the quality of ADI's technology, the dedication of our employees and the depth of our customer relationships. I have met many of you by phone already, and I look forward to getting on the road and meeting you in person.  Now getting to our results. As Vince mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2017 was an excellent period across multiple dimensions and caps off a very strong year. As I walk through the P&L, with the exception of revenue and non-op expense, my comments will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.  Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.54 billion, up 6% sequentially and above our guidance midpoint. Gross margins were 40- basis points higher than our guidance, primarily on higher utilization and cost synergy capture. Inventory was stable at 108 days in the quarter. And on a dollar basis, inventory increased $31 million sequentially as we ramped production to match strong demand. Distribution channel inventory of 7 weeks was stable to the prior quarter as well on both a weeks and a dollar basis.  Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $435 million or 28% of revenue, which improved operating margin to 42.6%. Non-op expenses in the fourth quarter were $67 million, and we should see this decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter for fiscal '18.  Our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 9% included a full year true-up to bring the 2017 rate to 9.6%. But as we look to 2018, we expect a 12% tax rate, which is an improvement versus our previously issued guidance of 15%. EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.45, bringing the full year to $4.72, up $1.65 from the prior fiscal year.  Free cash flow generation was very solid in the quarter at $630 million with an associated free cash flow margin of 41%. And during the quarter, we paid down $350 million of debt, which has helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.6, down from the 2.9 in the prior quarter.  Capital additions in the fourth quarter were $65 million, and we expect capital additions in fiscal 2018 to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales.  During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.45, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.80 per share. All in, a good quarter to wrap up a solid year.  Let us now turn to our outlook and expectations for the first quarter of fiscal '18, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis. We are planning for revenue in the 14-week first quarter to be in the range of $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion. We expect a full week's revenue benefit from this 14th week as it falls in the last week in the month of January. Adjusting for the additional week and at the midpoint of guidance, Q1 revenue is expected to decrease sequentially. On this same basis, we expect ADI's B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications in aggregate to decrease in the mid-single-digits sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter but to be up over the prior year, led by the industrial end-market. Given that our revenue guidance by end-market is not perfectly correlated with our actual results, this will also be the last quarter in which we provide our revenue outlook by end-market. Of course, we will continue to guide you to an overall revenue range.  We are planning for gross margins to remain relatively stable sequentially and to be in the range of 70.5% to 71%. Operating expenses are estimated to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million and include an additional week's worth of activity related to the 14-week quarter. On a 13-week basis, operating expenses are expected to decrease in the mid-single-digits sequentially.  Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of approximately 40% to 42% and for diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.36.  So to wrap it up, this was a terrific quarter of performance and wraps up a very strong year of revenue growth, margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're encouraged by a number of positive indicators across our business, including the strong secular growth drivers, a robust opportunity pipeline and access to customers at an unprecedented level, which, combined with our strong free cash flow and commitment to deleveraging, will continue to drive value for our shareholders.  Now before we move to the Q&A, I have an additional announcement. To help continue the successful integration of Linear Tech, I am delighted to announce that Ali Husain has accepted the position of CFO for ADI's Power division, supporting Steve Pietkiewicz and will be relocating with his family to sunny California. Vince and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ali for the tremendous work he has done with the investment community, and we look forward to working with him in this new role to drive even greater shareholder value in the future. Moving forward, Mike Lucarelli, whom many of you already know from his work with Ali over the past couple of years, will be your main point of contact in IR. I have enjoyed getting to know Mike over the past few weeks as someone who is both energetic and knowledgeable. I'm sure you'll find Mike to be a great resource for your investment research on ADI. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Ali for our Q&A session. Ali Husain : Great. Thanks, Prashanth. It's been a privilege working with the investment community, and I look forward to this new challenge.  So all right, let's get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] So operator, let's get to our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Vince, Prashanth, congratulations on the strong results. Ali, congratulations on the new role. My first question, Vince, is just around industrial year-over-year growth. I think, clearly, one of the investor concerns out there is that, that part of your business has been growing at greater than 20% for several quarters consecutively, and I think there are some concerns around sustainability. Last quarter, you sort of highlighted some one-offs that helped to drive some of the strength, including things like ATE. Were there one-offs in the October quarter? And I guess, more importantly, as you look out over the next several quarters, how would you expect year-over-year growth rate to trend? And what sort of the more normalized growth rate we should suspect as being sustainable? Vincent Roche : Yes, good question, John. Thanks. I think -- let me start with the last part of the question first about sustainable growth rates. If you look back over the last 5 years of our business, we've had a growth rate in 2017 that was well beyond 20% in the industrial sector. But actually, when you aggregate over 5 years, the growth rate was around 5%. And I think that is a sustainable number and the way to think about the long-term growth trajectory for the industrial business. So then looking into '18, how do we view things? Well, I think, for sure, the strong GDP environment bodes well for the industrial business, number one. I think also we're seeing good growth drivers. I've had the benefit of speaking to many executives of many of our industrial customers over the last several months, the last few quarters, and what I can tell you is that the activity in building out the industrial IoT, I talked in the prepared remarks about the brownfield upgrade in America, for example, the greenfield build-outs in China, all these things, I think, are good secular growth drivers that have many, many years of legs to them, particularly, I would say, in China. And added to that, John, we're seeing, for example, the emergence of these rechargeable batteries everywhere, in cars, obviously everybody knows about smartphones and so on and so forth. But the formation and test of those battery systems is quite a great performance challenge and an area where we see a lot of opportunity to bring precision technologies to market. So I think you've got to be skeptical to some extent. I think there are -- it's -- are those growth rates sustainable? Yes. I think on a 5% level, they are. But my sense is heading into '18, we should be able to hold the gains. I guess the only cautionary tale, if is there is one in the industrial market, is the world of ATE. But again, there, what we're seeing is the -- for example, the shift from hard disk drive to solid-state memories, the building out of these giga memory factories and giga factories in general to support consumer goods. So I think when you put everything together across instrumentation, aerospace and defense, factory automation and instrumentation in general, I think we're in for a good cycle right now. John Pitzer : Maybe as my follow-on, just on the consumer side, it was a lot stronger than expected in the October quarter. I wonder if you can give us some color on what was driving the strength. And I know, Prashanth, in your prepared comments, you mentioned you want to stay away from giving guidance on an ongoing basis by end-market. But during the Analyst Day this year, you kind of gave fairly specific guidance for all of fiscal '18 on consumer, and as we think about your differing content in flagship phones and how that might look into the January quarter, is there any help you can give us on what we should expect to see out of consumer, at least relative to seasonality going into January? Vincent Roche : Yes -- well, our consumer business in the quarter was ahead of expectation. It was at the high-end of our expectation, and it was clearly driven by portable applications. And as we signaled at the Analyst Day, we're expecting our consumer business to be done in 2018 largely on the back of a weaker portable market, portable business for ADI. And you're already starting to see that weakness in the guidance that we're now providing. So I think at the midpoint of guidance, if you take '18, the prediction for '18, we expect consumer to be down meaningfully over 2017. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: John, I will only add that if you take the guidance we've given you, you adjust for the 13th quarter, which is the first calculation, and then you back out the B2B guidance we've given you, you should be able to impute the consumer guide and you'll come up with a pretty meaningful number, which is the trend that we've been indicating for the past several quarters is starting to materialize. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : So I had a question on the automotive market. You highlighted 1 million units of A2B. Can you just talk about kind of the breadth of that? I know you mentioned before, but just kind of design -- breadth of design and how you see the trajectory in A2B. Vincent Roche : Craig, virtually, all the OEMs across the globe have adopted A2B. And we just basically got our steam going in 2017 largely in the U.S. and, to some extent, Europe. So we're at the very, very early stages. We're not at the knee of the curve yet, so to speak. So I expect a hockey stick in the A2B market over the next 3 years, and it will ramp in '18 and '19. And I think we'll be at some significant, sustainable level of revenue in the 2020 time frame. So it's -- we're in the ramp phase, but I think it's very meaningful that we've already shipped 1 million units into production models at this point. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. And then as my follow-up for Prashanth, what are the key areas as you kind of step into the CFO role there, key areas of focus for you and opportunities you see going forward? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Thank you. So certainly, my primary goal is going to be ensuring that we deliver against the financial model that was communicated over the summer. That means we need to grow our revenue, convert that revenue into high profit dollars and then deliver that profit as cash flow growth to pay down our debt. I would say equally important will be to work collectively with the 3 division presidents to ensure the successful integration of LTC, to achieve both the revenue and the cost synergies that were underpinning the deal rationale. And then maybe last, I think Vince had mentioned in prior calls that I've been chartered with working with the division leaders to really uncover and capture opportunities for trapped value to help drive shareholder value. That includes areas that I've already begun working with the organization on such as pricing. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : I'm hoping you can characterize lead times and book-to-bill in the quarter that's being reported and compare them to the prior quarter. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Yes, I can help you with that. So as I mentioned, activity remains fairly stable. So on a book-to-bill basis at the enterprise level, just a hair under 1 as we head into the first quarter, and then if you back out consumer, some slight expansion versus that. However, the -- as I mentioned, the channel still looks very stable at around 7 weeks and equivalent on a dollar basis. So we're heading into the holiday season, but from where we stand today, given the somewhat limited visibility that this industry has, things look to be stable. William Stein : Okay. One other as a follow-up, if I can. I'm hoping you can offer some competitive commentary on the converter market in light of one of the field programmable gate array companies highlighting this product they call an RFSoC that they indicate is taking share in the converter market. If you can comment on that. Vincent Roche : Yes. Look, as is the dynamic in the business world, good markets are always going to attract competition. And I think competition in the converter market in general has been really consolidating over the last 5 or 7 years, so -- but we've got a 5-decade history of building high-performance analog solutions for our customers across the board in areas like wireless infrastructure, wired infrastructure and other important areas like aerospace and defense, civil aviation and so on. And what I can tell you for sure is that as the OEMs deal with ever-increasing technology complexity, our customers in the area of these communication systems, in particular, where a lot of the very, very high-speed data converter products are used, they need a very broad array of microwave, of RF mixed-signal technologies and, of course, power technologies. And it's really about smartly partitioning their solutions for performance, for power efficiency, for footprint and last but not least, cost. And we have a multi-decade history of not only delivering on all aspects of those performance dimensions across the board, but also, we've been delivering a broad suite and array of converter products for many, many years on time with very high quality, and last but not least, great support at the application and system level. So there will always be competition, but our portfolio is unmatched in our industry irrespective of whatever configuration a customer is using. So there will always be competition, but it's our job to stay ahead right on the cutting edge of what's possible. Operator : Our next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, first question, as you think about the extra week in January, do you expect that to be equally apportioned across all segments? Or do you think 1 or 2 will do better than others? And I guess, as a follow-up to that, how do you think about normal seasonality heading into the April quarter? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. So C.J., that extra week is just the calendar consequence of how the ADI fiscal is run. So it comes around every 5 to 6 years. It will be equivalent across all industries. And since it falls sort of in the month of January, I would not expect anything out of the ordinary for that. But I would remind everyone that as you build your models going forward into Q2 that you do want to adjust your sequential growth rates to reflect that you're moving from a 14-week into a 13-week quarter. Christopher Muse : Okay. And then I guess as my follow-up, I guess to kind of follow on, on John's question around the sustainability of industrial strength year-on-year, can you kind of walk through as you look back on '17, how much of the strength was sort of a reset to GDP versus replenishment in the distribution channel versus rising silicon content? How do you think about those 3 factors in terms of 20-plus percent growth? Vincent Roche : Well, yes, in times -- in terms of rising silicon content, I think there's no question there is more sensing, more measuring being applied to factory automation and process control machines, so we benefit from that. Something that doesn't get talked about as much is the automation of labor in China, and that's going to be a multiyear build-out. And many of our European and Japanese customers, in particular, are benefiting from that build-out. But that will be -- that's part of the China 2025 initiative, so that's very significant and will be for a long time to come. And I think -- look, there's certainly an anxiety around supply out there, so clearly, a certain amount of the demand is driven by anxiety. But I would say, when you look across our channel, you look across our customer base, inventories are up somewhat. Our inventories are up a little, but we're building inventory on the basis of what we believe to be real demand. So I think this is very much a demand-driven cycle. And I think when you look at the inventories across the board, things are in pretty good balance at the moment. Operator : Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : First, on the guidance for next quarter. The B2B corrected for the extra week down mid-single-digits. It seems to be a bit worse than I would consider normal. Is there anything specific across your 3 businesses, I guess, relative to what we'd ordinarily see as we go into Q1 that's driving that maybe a little worse than normal seasonality? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Well, I would say, Stacy, that when you look at that on a year-over-year basis, even guiding B2B as we did, is still pretty healthy growth year-on-year. So that gets you almost to high single digits, low double digits. Stacy Rasgon : Yes, but industrial is up like 25%, right? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sorry? Stacy Rasgon : The industrial is up like 25% year-over-year, so I mean, what's going on sequentially? Ali Husain : Stacy, in the first quarter, if you back into the guidance, industrial would be up in the mid-teens. And the B2B markets, as Prashanth mentioned, are forecast to be up in the high single digits over the prior year in the first quarter on a 13 -- to 13-week basis. So into a quarter, that is typically lower on a seasonality basis, particularly for industrial given that you have the holiday period for the factories. Stacy Rasgon : But I mean, you always have a holiday period in that quarter, right? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Correct. I'm just saying on a sequential basis. Ali Husain : Yes, I mean, C.J. -- sorry, Stacy, we're headed into a seasonally weaker quarter. We read the order flows and we provide you with a guidance range that we think is reasonable. You can choose to take the midpoint of that range. It creates a high single-digit growth in the B2B markets over the prior year. That's the best we can tell you. The other thing I'll point out is we did beat the midpoint of the guidance in the prior quarter by 260- basis points, so we're certainly coming off of a pretty strong result. And I think the year-over-year growth rate is really what we would look to in terms of how we think about running the business and the success of our business. So I hope that's helpful. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : I did. I wanted to ask about automotive. So it's kind of flattish year-over-year -- I mean, sequentially but also year-over-year on a combined basis with Linear, which is a little bit at odds with what we're seeing from some peers. It also maybe sounds like a little bit at odds with what you're seeing on your A2B market and the growth in there. So can you talk a little bit about the auto dynamics, in particular, on a year-over-year basis? When does it start to grow? And what's been going on this last year? Vincent Roche : Sure, Stacy. So yes, yes, okay. So if you look at the legacy ADI business during '17, that part of our automotive business grew in the high single digits. Where we had some headwind was specifically because of the continuing battery management weakness in the LTC portfolio. So that whole BMS thing, that whole markets is highly concentrated in terms of customers and programs. So really, what we're seeing is still a working off of the inventories in China, but the pipeline that we have in BMS designs is good. And so we see that business recovering during '18 as several of these new customer programs start to come online. So I think by the end of '18, we'll be on a good growth track in that business. But that is the primary dampening effect, if you like, on our automotive business. And as we said at the Analyst Day, we expect this business to grow at 2 to 3x SAAR, and that's still our commitment. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : If you look at the operating margins, they've expanded over -- by about 450- basis points over the last year, 950 bps over the last 3 years. And I was wondering, is there a physical limit to the margin profile here? Is there any reason why they would not continue to drift up over time? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Mark, I would probably take you back to the financial model, and that's the -- that's where we have modeled out how this business is going to -- is expected to operate over the next several years. So we have some favorability movement now. We've talked about utilization rates. We've talked about bringing in synergies a little earlier than possible. But I would say that the way to think about it is to really hold us with -- to that model because that's how -- the standard we hold ourselves to. Mark Lipacis : And a follow-up, if I may. The -- if you look at previous industries that have consolidated, you do see an upward bias on -- or better pricing environment. The analog industry has been consolidating. You guys have been an important driver of that. Can you describe -- Prashanth, I know that you had mentioned pricing as one area of focus as you head into this opportunity. Can you describe what you have been seeing on the pricing environment over the years? Are there -- are you noticing changes? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, Mark, I'm going to let Vince take that since he has a bit longer perspective on pricing and the trends that we're seeing. Vincent Roche : Yes, I think it's true to say that, certainly, consolidation has helped to stabilize prices across the industry. We're also seeing stabilization partly because of the environment in which we are working, but also because we're paying a lot more attention to getting -- understanding where there's elasticity and just basically holding onto the value that we generate better. So I think it's a trend, and we're certainly seeing a stabilizing trend across our business over the last 2 or 3 years, and I believe that stability will continue. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And Mark, I would only add from my personal observation, is we -- there's a broad section of the ADI portfolio that is very sticky. And we need to ensure that we take advantage of that to ensure that we're getting fair value for the value -- for the technology that we bring to our customers, and that could represent some pricing opportunities. Operator : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations to Prashanth and to Ali. My first question is on communications. So it's starting to grow nicely year-over-year again. I was just hoping you could add a little bit more color on what's driving that, especially in relation to topics like 4.5G, 5G, optical and so on. Vincent Roche : Yes, sure, Tore. So the communications business, as you know, is driven by 2 primary sectors. We've seen wireless infrastructure particularly strong. It was up over the prior quarter and driven by demand in developing regions like India, for example, but also in more developed markets like North America and China. We've seen both macro and small cell strength. And I'll give you a little more color in terms of technology in a second before I -- after I make a comment on the wireline side of things. So it's well known that the wireline business, particularly the optical part of that, has shown weakness in China over the past year. So that's been the damper there. I think the wireless sector is going to see some good growth in the coming 3 to 5 years. And I'll give you a little bit of color on that. As I see it, the -- there's good activity still on 4G, heavy activity in 4.5G, and 5G is in trials right now. But I think the boundaries between 4.5 and 5G are bloating to some extent. Both of them are going to be based on massive MIMO, and the indications are that, that market is going to start to ramp in the latter part of 2018, into 2019 and won't hit peak until 2020. But as I said, we're seeing, for example, activity where customers, our existing customers, are targeting at extending life of 4G systems. So there's activity in upgrading 4G, introducing 4.5G and getting 5G into play. So as I said, I think with all the demands for mobile data, we're still working hard on the classical problems of integration, design agility, power consumption. And with our LTC, the acquisition of LTC, we have a very strong power portfolio. So we're in a better and better position as a company to take advantage of these trends across the board. So whatever the configuration that customers use in 4, 4.5, 5G, ADI is very well prepared to satisfy our customers' needs. Tore Svanberg : That's very helpful. And for my follow-up for Prashanth, so you talked about utilization being up sequentially. Can you talk about where you stand on utilization today? And maybe more certain, in general, where you are on in-house versus outside outsourcing at this point, especially given some of the fiber capacity that's out there at the wafer level? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, sure. Thank you. So I think your first question is utilization levels. So Q3 -- sorry, excuse me, Q4 was a significant improvement for us in utilization. We don't share specific utilization percentage rate, but it's fair to say that we were extremely busy internally in our fabs. And on the balance between now that we have the LTC operation in -- consolidated, we're about 50-50 split between what we do in-house and what we give to third parties or our channel partners. Operator : Our final question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Gabriel Ho : This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. So I'm just looking at the core, ADI business is up 14% year-over-year, and then your Linear is up 5%. So what is driving the differences in year-to-year performance? And also going forward, how should we think about maybe the 2 business to come work as you integrate the 2 businesses? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So -- I'm sorry, I did not catch your name. Gabriel Ho : This is Gabriel Ho. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Gabriel. Sorry, sorry. Thank you, Gabriel. All right. So I would say a few things. First, LTC's industrial business grew double digits year-over-year. So that's very much in line with how the peers are doing. The automotive business, Vince has already spoken to. The inventory unwind and what's happening there. So overall, we're comfortable with where LTC is. I think, historically, an investor pain point for LTC has been their focus on managing the business for gross margins versus a balance of revenue growth, and that is part of what the integration process is driving and bringing them into ADI's mindset about profitable growth to deliver the EBIT margin and the free cash flow. So as we look forward, I think that's very much into what we look to merge with the organization is to bring that top line focus into LTC, which, for some of the organization, hasn't been as strong as in ADI. Gabriel Ho : I see. And as a follow-up, I think now that the 2 businesses are combined, I think setting the 13-, 14-week quarter aside, so how should we think about in general the seasonality of your business for each quarter on a quarterly basis going forward? Ali Husain : Yes, Gabriel, I'll just take that. I think the way to think about it is that the ADI and Linear Tech B2B markets actually behave quite similarly on a seasonal basis. And what I would encourage you to do is we placed a schedule on our website that tracks the end market revenue by quarter for the combined companies and suggest that you can go back and calculate what you think seasonality would be because going forward, it's our sense that these 2 businesses, certainly in the B2B markets, track actually pretty similarly.  So okay. I hope that was helpful. Thank you again for joining us this morning for the call. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website. And all the reconciliations and additional information can be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com. So with that, thank you for joining us, and have a Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.  I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2018 conference call.  With me on the call are today are ADI CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. Anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be archived in the Investor section of our website. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Our commentary about ADI's first quarter financial results will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our first quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules, which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com. And lastly, I'd like to remind investors that our first quarter was a 14-week quarter.  Okay. So with that, I'll turn it over to ADI CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal '18 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now. Revenue in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets offset the expected decline in our consumer business. Our strong execution as a combined company delivered substantial growth and operating margin expansion compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in a 50% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. And our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continues to place us in the highest tier in the S&P 500. So digging into our markets. The industrial end market consisting of a diverse, highly fragmented set of applications represented approximately 50% of sales in the quarter. Our sales into this market have been stellar, increasing an average of 8% annually over the past 5 years, outperforming GDP by 2 to 3x.  I'd like to spend some time today now providing a little insight into why we believe we've outperformed in this market and why we remain excited for the future. On a broad level, we believe we've gained market share by targeting the right applications, developing the right products and bringing our domain expertise to bear as we engage with our customers at a more system-oriented level. For example, in our instrumentation business, our cutting-edge mixed-signal RF and microwave and power solutions are enabling the most advanced test solutions for 5G data center operations and battery formation deployment for new and existing customers.  The aerospace and defense sector continues to be a strong growth market for ADI also. This business is driven largely by fleet modernization and the development and deployment of complex applications that require the highest-performing electronics, such as phased-array radar. The combination of ADI's mixed signal, Hittite\u2019s microwave and LTC's power portfolios enables us unprecedented levels of integration across the signal chain and more than doubles our available market. Our industrial automation and process control business continues to benefit as factory floors transform to become more flexible and more automated. Customers are striving for higher overall productivity and a higher variety of output. In this changing landscape, our technology breadth and domain expertise is positioning us to win more of the BOM with customers worldwide. We're engaged in brownfield upgrades and greenfield installations. Looking to the future of automation and process control, also referred to as the industrial IoT, we believe that our customer engagements combined with emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence-enabled machines, sensor-to-cloud data processing, ubiquitous sensing and true real-time connectivity, will enable consistent content expansion for ADI. For example, on the factory floor of the future, robots and cobots will increasingly require more sensing modalities such as vibration, proximity and depth sensing as well as the highly synchronized real-time communications capabilities that we are bringing to market. These developments open the opportunity to expand our dollar content by a factor of 5.  In short, we see continued momentum across our industrial applications as we move into 2018. And that, coupled with the underlying sector trends I've just described, should position us for profitable growth over the long term in this area.  So turning now to the communications market. This sector represented 19% of sales in the first quarter and benefited from strong growth in wireless compared to the year ago quarter while wired demand remained weak. Our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months due to share gains from recently released products co-designed with Hittite, strong demand for our integrated transceiver solutions and our position in virtually all emerging 5G and massive MIMO trials. We remain excited about our wireless infrastructure business as we continue to grow share and increase content despite a relatively flat CapEx environment. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave, high-speed signal processing and power management is unmatched in breadth and depth. This portfolio, combined with our deep customer focus in the bigger verticals as well as in the broad market, is fueling our success.  Turning now to our automotive business. At 17% of sales, it performed better than our typical seasonality in the first quarter on strength from the infotainment and powertrain application areas. Our powertrain solutions that improve efficiency of both combustion engines and electric vehicles grew stronger than seasonal. We see this business becoming increasingly important for us, particularly as OEMs embrace broad electrification of their fleets. Our infotainment application area has grown at a high single-digit rate over the past 5 years, thanks to our market leadership in high-performance audio and video solutions that improve the passenger experience. We see continued momentum with our innovative A2B technology, which has secured design wins at major OEMs in every geographical region and is enabling creative new audio architectures that will come to market over the next few years. So these businesses, combined with our organic and technology acquisitions for next-gen sensing technologies necessary, for example, in Level 3 and beyond safety systems for autonomous vehicles, gives me great confidence that we're well positioned to grow at our long-term model of 2 to 3x SAAR. In our consumer business, revenue decreased as expected both sequentially and compared to a year ago quarter and represented 16% of sales in the first quarter.  So before I hand the call over to Prashanth, I'd like to give you an update on our LTC integration progress. It's been nearly a year since we closed the acquisition, and we've made tremendous progress integrating and building something that we believe is greater than the sum of its parts by following a best-of-both approach. At this point, everyone in our company across the entire organization, sales, engineering operations, manufacturing and so on -- is working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. And when you look at traditional measures of M&A success, our exceptional employee retention and strong financial results over the past year speak for themselves.  So we're on track to achieve the initial cost synergies we targeted when we announced the deal, and we continue to believe that we can realize meaningful revenue synergies over the long term given the complementarity of our customer bases and products. As a rule of thumb, we believe that for every dollar of mixed-signal content ADI sells into a system, there's at least an equal value power opportunity that ADI can now more fully address. With our sales and adjoining teams now integrated on working together, our opportunity pipeline continues to expand, giving us more confidence in converting that $1 billion-plus synergy opportunity into revenue.  So to wrap it up, fiscal '18 is off to a very strong start. Analog Devices' capabilities to effectively and efficiently bridge the digital and physical domains are needed more than ever as the world becomes more digital, more autonomous and more connected. With our ability to address opportunities from sensor to cloud, DC to 100 gigahertz and beyond, and nanowatts to kilowatts, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value for years to come.  And so with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.  Before I get to our results for the quarter, I want to address 3 items : first, our recent announcement aimed around the streamlining of our global operations; second, the impact from the Tax Cuts and Job Acts; and lastly, an update on our progress deleveraging.  Last month, we announced our intention to close our Hillview wafer fab and Singapore test operations. Following a careful and thoughtful analysis, we validated this decision based on the capabilities and overall strength of the world-class supply chain that we have built organically and through acquisition. It will take us about 3-plus years to wind down these operations and ensure a smooth transition for our customers. Once complete, these 2 factory closures represent a significant portion of the additional $100 million of cost synergies we outlined at our Analyst Day in June '17.  Our current quarter GAAP results include a charge of $57 million, the majority of which relate to this action and will be cash. The overall program, which will include some expenses in future periods, will have a good payback of approximately 1 year. Next, I want to summarize the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on ADI with the caveat that these are our initial estimates and could change as we refine our analysis. Investors should assume no change to our previously discussed long-term non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12%, a level which we expect to return to in fiscal '19. This comprehends the benefits of a lower statutory rate, offset by a higher rate on foreign earnings. However, our 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 6% to 8% as the higher rate on our foreign earnings does not take effect until our next fiscal year.  So let me take a moment to reconcile our first quarter GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate. In the first quarter of '18, our GAAP tax expense included a net charge of $47 million related to tax reform. This charge included an approximately $690 million accrual on the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, which was almost completely offset by approximately $640 million noncash reduction in our deferred tax balances. We plan to pay this tax over 8 years beginning in fiscal '19, and we expect to pay approximately $60 million in each of the first 5 years and the remaining balance over the following 3 years. The end result from tax reform is that ADI can more optimally utilize the entirety of its cash position and continue to delever and return value to shareholders.  Which brings me to my last topic : leverage. We exited our first fiscal 2018 quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4, down from 2.6 in the prior quarter and down from 3x at the close of the LTC deal last year. Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least $1 billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our cap allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value.  So now let's discuss the quarter. As Vince mentioned, the 14-week first quarter of 2018 was a very strong quarter for ADI. Revenue was $1.52 billion, above the midpoint of guidance and increased 54% year-over-year while declining 1% sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter. Looking at the combined company and excluding or backing out the benefit of the 14th week, our B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year, led by growth in the industrial market, which increased mid-teens compared to the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins of 71% came in at the upper end of guidance and increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Op expenses in the first quarter were $446 million or 29% of revenue. And on a 13-week basis, op expenses declined about 5% sequentially. We've now completed the OpEx synergies outlined in our LTC deal announcement. Strong revenue growth and operating leverage delivered operating margin of 41.7%, at the upper end of guidance. Nonop expenses in the first quarter were $66 million. We expect our nonop expenses to be approximately $60 million in our second quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter in fiscal '18. Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. And as previously discussed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for '18 to be in the range of 6% to 8% before increasing to the long-term expected rate of approximately 12% for fiscal '19.  Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.42, and this included a benefit of $0.09 related to our lower tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP EPS came in at the upper end of the guided range.  That wraps up the P&L, and I'll move to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially or $9 million, primarily the result of our decision to keep production levels commensurate with bookings to maintain the customer service levels based on the B2B demand environment. As a result, days of inventory increased to 124, and we expect days to decline over the balance of the year beginning in the second quarter.  Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, up slightly compared to the year ago quarter but in line with our outlook. We generated free cash of $325 million in the quarter. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined company was $1.8 billion. CapEx additions in the fourth quarter were $63 million, and we expect CapEx in fiscal '18 to run at our model of about 4% of sales.  During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends. Our Board of Directors approved yesterday a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share, which represents an annual dividend of $1.92. So now I'll move to the outlook and expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. We're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.51 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the year ago quarter at the midpoint. As a reminder, first quarter was a 14-week quarter and second quarter is back to a normal 13-week quarter. Adjusting for this, we are planning our B2B markets, which include industrial, automotive and comms, in the aggregate to increase at a high single-digit rate sequentially and thus represent a larger mix of business. We're planning for gross margins to be in the range of 71% to 71.5% due to a more favorable mix and as we capture the final amount of our initial tranche of COGS synergies. We expect OpEx to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million in the second quarter. And at the midpoint of this guidance, this implies a sub-30% OpEx as a percentage of sales once again. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the second quarter of '18 to be in the range of 41% to 42.5% and for diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.44.  So to summarize, we're off to a great start for the year. Industrial continues to have momentum across all our application areas. We're outperforming in comms driven by our strong position in wireless. In automotive, we're making great progress on putting the combined company on a strong growth trajectory. As Vince mentioned, the LTC integration is going very well. Our innovation pipeline is rich, and we are just getting started.  With that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session. Michael Lucarelli : Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : A question for Vince. Just your commentary about market share gains, can you provide any specific examples there and kind of how you view where you are in that process in terms of it translating into revenue? Vincent Roche : Yes. I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. And if I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity and the place where we're able to combine the rich portfolio of the Hittite Microwave technologies with ADI's mixed signal. And we're seeing continued digitalization in that space, fleet upgrades, and we're benefiting from that enormously. And also in automation, just the sheer breadth of what we have and the focus that we've had over the last several years in tuning the R&D portfolio, resteering our sales force globally into making sure that we keep our leadership position at the large customers is benefiting enormously the whole growth story. Also, with the combination of LTC, as you know, the market overlaps were quite high between LTC and ADI. But the actual areas where our sales forces were playing were pretty complementary. So we're gaining, I think, at the large customers, the small customers with more breadth and depth in terms of portfolio than we've ever had. If you look at the communication sector, I think, again, we're starting to see the benefit now of the -- particularly in the wireless area of the codesign products with Hittite combined with ADI's, again, strength on the mixed-signal side in traditional macro base stations. Our integrated transceivers are becoming, if you like, the standard now for massive MIMO developments in these hybrid macro small-cell systems, where phased-array antenna systems are being used with traditional antenna systems. So our software-defined transceiver is really the standard, the benchmark now in that sector. And as the trials begin for massive MIMO and 5G, we're in virtually all those trials globally. So I think those are just 2 -- some subsets in the industrial area and particularly in the wireless area in communications where we have demonstrable gains, I believe, in market share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : My first question was, can you just help us understand the deltas you had in the business segments? Just help us understand what happened as the quarter progressed in terms of the guidance that you had provided and the results that you ended up with. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Can you clarify that question, Ambrish? Are you asking sequentially how the business did in the reported results? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes. My question is you had guided to certain results for -- expectations for the -- for all the segments, but then the results came in different for each of the segment, particularly in the automotive and also in industrials. So what transpired that your results were different than what you were expecting initially? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. So as a reminder, we no longer give guidance at the segment level, so we did not provide that for the first quarter. We did provide some broad indications on how B2B would do versus consumer. But now that the results are actual, Mike can kind of walk you through how each of the B2B segments -- each of the components of our B2B did on a year-over-year basis, which across the board were very good. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. So Ambrish, we guided to B2B to be down mid-single digits. B2B came down 3% sequentially on a combined company basis, but I think they\u2019re pretty good result in the first quarter. If you look at automotive business, it was down 2% sequentially, which is a bit better than typical seasonality. We -- it's highlighted in his prepared comments, infotainment, powertrain application areas were stronger. Our communications business, it's tough. There's really no seasonality in that business. But I think what's important there, it grew year-over-year. And it really was led by our wireless growth, which is up double digits year-over-year. And industrial was down about 3% sequentially on an adjusted basis or up mid-teens percent year-over-year. Once again, very good strong growth there. In consumer, we saw it as weak. It was weak. It performed as we expected. Do you have a follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did. Sorry. My question was on the inventory side. Inventories were up. And I think if I look back at the last several years, typically in the quarter, inventories are either flat or down on a dollar basis. But you said that you build inventory. But as you go through the year, in terms of days, you expect inventories to come down. So just kind of help us understand what are you seeing and then why should inventory be trending down as we go through the year? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, okay. Thanks, Ambrish. Thanks for the question. So inventory was up 2% or about $9 million quarter-over-quarter. Most of that $9 million was built for the B2B markets, and that was driven by a strategic decision we made to keep the production levels sort of commensurate with the bookings idea, bookings outlook that we had driven by, one, making sure that we can maintain the high levels of customer service that are needed and to target our lead times sort of in that 4- to 6-week range. The -- like everyone looks at inventory levels as an indicator or as a canary in the coal mine of what demand looks like, and I would say that all the other indicators we're following remain very green. Our book-to-bill is above parity, both with and without consumer. Lead times remain stable, and we see no change in cancellation activity. Part of that $9 million was a small but relatively immaterial amount due to an accounting policy that we harmonized between LTC and ADI. But in general, we feel very good about where we are in inventory in light of the demand we see for Q2, and we expect days to decline at a normal pace over the balance of the year. Vincent Roche : Yes. I'll add another one, Ambrish. The internal fabs are the largest supply line for our industrial business. And what we're seeing there, of course, is the book-to-bill is positive and has been now for several quarters. And as Prashanth said, we're eager to make sure that we keep our lead times at a level where we can supply the upside demand here. So I think that's worth considering when you think about why we kept our internal fabs running at a higher clip than we would normally do for the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Could you walk us through puts and takes on free cash flow in the quarter? I know there's a bunch of stuff going on with the tax law and everything else. The number itself was a little lower than I might have expected. And I just want to see if you can give us a walk-through with all the puts and takes there. I think it's -- there's more going on there than normal this quarter. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, absolutely. So free cash flow, we have the hat trick in Q1, 3 items that were sort of buried in there. First, we make our large annual payment to the IRS, so federal taxes were paid in the first quarter. Second, we make our once every 2-year payment for the employee bonus program, and then we also make our once every 2-year payment for our interest debt. So some big outlying -- outgoing items that hit us with some lumpiness. The way to look at cash flow, as we do, is on a trailing 12-month basis, generating $1.8 billion over the last 12 months, continuously very strong expectations on cash flow. The model has not changed. We convert a high amount of the profitability to cash, and you'll see strength there for second quarter in the cash flow number. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. For my follow-up, I had a question on the longer-term synergies around the fab closures. So you're looking at 3 to 5 years to close these factories. In the past, when you closed your own factories, it didn't take 3 to 5 years. It was more like 1 to 2 when you closed Sunnyvale or Limerick or Cambridge. Why does it take 3 to 5 years to close the Linear facilities? Vincent Roche : Well, it tends to take 3 years. There's -- given the multiple recipes that we have in our foundries and the back-end operations, it does tend to take about 3 years typically, and that's what I believe will be the case with the LTC Singapore and Milpitas closures as well. Our job #1 is to make sure that we keep our service and quality levels high for our customers across the many thousands of customers and hundreds and hundreds of applications and, as I said, the myriad recipes that we've done. So it will take most likely 3. But obviously, we're trying to push as hard as we can for the efficiencies to kick in earlier. But that's the rule of thumb, 3 years. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And Stacy, maybe just a quick comment I would add is that the net result is the 2 closures, but what's going on under the covers is quite a bit of process movement among multiple facilities, internal and external. So you're seeing -- we're talking about the net output. But under the cover, it's a lot more complex than just shutting down the 2 operations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I had a question on the consumer business. In the past, I think you guys talked about fiscal year '18 consumer revenues being down somewhere between 20% and 30%. I was just curious, does that range still hold? And if not, what are some of the things that are driving the potential change there? Vincent Roche : Yes. So thank you. Well, look, our 2Q guidance would imply that consumer will be down somewhere in the region of 10% quarter-on-quarter on a 13-week basis and down about again 10% on a year-over-year basis. So our expectations remain unchanged. We believe that 2018 will be down meaningfully over '17 in terms of at least the portable consumer revenue. And the first half is now shaping up within the range of our expectations. And we're expecting weakness in the second half on an annual basis. So the number we've given you of a 20% to 30% overall decline in the business still stands. And as I said, that's driven by our portable business, our prosumer AV, the audio/video nonportable side of things, is in good shape and continues to grow for the company. Toshiya Hari : Great. And I had a follow-up for Prashanth. I guess, it's been several months since you joined ADI. I guess, the question is what are some of the things that you've learned about the company and about the industry during this time frame that you perhaps didn't fully appreciate prior to joining the company? And what are some of the changes that you hope to drive in terms of the financial at the company going forward? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks. That's a very long question if I wanted to give you a thoughtful answer, but I'll give you a quick item, which I continue to reflect on. The correlation of the ADI business to the B2B markets and the stability that we have in our customer base is something that I'm continuously impressed on. This is not a business that -- given how embedded we are and how close we are to our customers and the broad spread of products that we are incorporated in, I think sometimes, investors don't fully appreciate that we will follow much more closely to a different set of markets than other perhaps semi companies that operate in the digital space, and that's something that we're going to continue to have to help the investor community appreciate as the strength of this business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Kanghui Ong : This is Jeriel on behalf of Ross. Got 2 quick ones. First on OpEx, I see you guys guided OpEx down. I think we were expecting it to be down a little bit more. I understand it's basically guiding it back to the October range, but other than the 14- and 13-week quarter, what's the trajectory for OpEx going forward? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Right. So the way to think about the OpEx is that for the -- starting in the second quarter, you'll begin to see the impacts of some of the normal items that flow in, including our merit increases, which start to come in, and the impact of the performance bonus metrics. The second quarter, you'll see is more aligned to where we were in the fourth quarter if you adjust out some of the noise of the 14th week that we had in the first quarter as well as there's some sort of seasonal slowdown of spending that happens in the first quarter. So I would guide you that OpEx in the second quarter, if we put -- we expect kind of be in that -- in the sub-30% of revenue, which we think is a great target for us as we continue to drive the conversion of the cash, so -- conversion of the profit. But nothing more notable really in the OpEx spend. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Jeriel, I'd like to add one thing there. If you look at our combined company, Linear and ADI, our guidance implies a high single-digit year-on-year growth, and the OpEx is flat over that time. That's a good result. And what that is, is we well manage our expenses and we're capturing synergies. If you look in the back half of the year, typically, I would say OpEx is up a little bit in 3Q because of merit increases and maybe flat in the fourth quarter. I think we'll start to do even better than that this year given the synergies. Kanghui Ong : And as a follow-up, I just want to ask a question on auto growth. I think it's probably safe to say that your auto business probably undergrew the industry as a whole last year in 2017. But what gives you confidence that it can grow 2 to 3x SAAR? Is that a falloff or a flattening in the declines in the passive safety business? Or what gives you confidence in that regard? Vincent Roche : Yes, good question. So let me parse the business a bit for you. So we have roughly a $900 million automotive business today across the combination of ADI and LT. ADI is roughly 2/3 of that; LT, 1/3. The ADI portion of that business has been growing in line with the 2x to 3x SAAR target. And in 2017, that part of our business grew in the high single digits and also in the first quarter of '18. As Mike said in one of the prior answers, our automotive business is actually better than seasonal, typically, year-over-year in the first quarter. So the ADI portion is growing high single digits and the LT piece is growing in the low single digits. But we believe, given the opportunity pipe that we're seeing and the opportunity pipe that we inherited from LT, that even though the LT part of the business is growing more modestly, that over the coming couple of years, at least the power piece of that will get into the higher single-digit area at least into the model. And everywhere that -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use a rule of thumb that for every dollar of mixed signal or legacy ADI Hittite content, there's at least $1 of LT power. I will tell you as well that we're already starting to see revenue synergies on the LT side. We're winning designs for power management. And as we kind of retune the business logic on the LT side and we tune the organization and the business for profitable growth, we're already beginning to see the start of synergies there. The BMS sector, well, we've said before that was a trouble spot for ADI in 2017, the battery management area. But it has stabilized and is now in the recovery phase. So we're expecting to be able to grow the battery management part of our business in double digits this year. And as I said, that is at the beginning phases of what I think will be a strong recovery during the second quarter. Michael Lucarelli : If you take a step back, I would say 2017 was -- grew about low single digits year-on-year as a combined business. I think 2018 is shaping up to be better than that given our book of business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : When's your -- industrial sales have sort of been off the charts over the last couple of quarters.  What's your level of visibility into the consumption of these parts in that when you look at this kind of growth, we have not seen that before -- but you have mentioned a couple of very strong drivers :  aerospace, defense and industrial automation and so forth. But what are the metrics you look at to just convince yourself that this kind of growth rate is sustainable and then there isn't some kind of inventory or other risk bearing up somewhere? Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a good question. I think, primarily, we as a company pay very careful attention to the end consumption. We look at sell-through in measuring the performance of our business, not what we ship into the channel, but what we sell through and what customers are consuming. So I would say first and foremost, that's the case. When you look at the backdrop, our market growth is very broad based, and all applications and geographies are up in double digits year-over-year. So again, you look at the PMIs, they're still in expansion phase globally. And GDP is converging across the globe across all the major geographies into an expansionary phase. So also, we pay a lot of attention to what our customers are saying. And I would tell you that our customers across the board and all the regions are pragmatically optimistic. And their belief, given the macro environment, the macro backdrop, the PMI situation and the vast deployment of high-end machinery into the Asia region in particular, that '18 is going to be another good year and that we'll see momentum continue from '17, which we are experiencing right now. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Vivek, thanks for the question. I will just add, book-to-bill is looking very good. Lead times are stable and short, and we also are very conscious of what inventory in the channel is, and it does not give us concern. Operator : Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Harsh Kumar : Vincent, I had a quick question for you, sort of piggybacking on to what the previous question was. Doing extremely well in industrial, could you characterize the end markets that you plan? Do you think it's a function of that? Or do you think it's some other things that you guys as a company are doing to garner over-the-top growth? Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a good question. I think we as a company retooled our strategy several years ago and primarily decided that we were focusing ADI's investments in the B2B space and pointing our sales force at the B2B area. Industrial is one of the first calls on our R&D. And the crop of products, I think, we have now is the strongest that it's ever been. So we are getting more content gain across all our industrial customers, both big and small. And I will tell you as well that in the areas of aerospace and defense and instrumentation, the combination with Hittite has really -- that's catalyzed content gain, and I think we're able to solve our customers' problems at a level that others can't in these areas. We're able to take a complete system, be it nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud, microwave to bits. So I think a large part is the sheer arsenal of technologies and products that we've got and we bring to bear, the focus that we've got as a company and how we're serving our customers' needs, being able to build more complete solutions for them. And we do that globally. And as I mentioned earlier, the combination of the LT sales and applications force with ADI just strengthens our position and enables us to cover evermore customers. So I think it's a case of converging, innovation engine working well. Our customer engagements are stronger than they've ever been. And we've been focused and making sure that we are able to gain share and build competitive advantage now for several years in the industrial area. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks for the question, Harsh. I would -- maybe I'll just wrap up in saying we have a very good process internally on selecting where we choose to invest and where we choose to innovate. And as Vince mentioned in his prepared remarks, you see that paying off by placing the right bets on where we see the secular trends growing at. Operator : And our final question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Just wanted to kind of take a step back here and look at the underlying demand trends for the business and just get a sense on how broad based it was from a geographical perspective. Macroeconomic demand trends remain relatively healthy. Maybe if you guys could just talk about the year-over-year growth trends in the different geographies. Vincent Roche : Mike, do you want to take that? Michael Lucarelli : Yes, sure. First, I'll caution you. I mean, looking at the geography trends for us is not as useful as we base geography revenue on design-in activity. But in general, our strength is broad based. It's up double digits in every region in industrial. Our wireless business did good across the globe as well. I mean, this is definitely, I would call, a global synchronized growth scenario that we are benefiting from and really we've doing better than, I would say, given what Vince has talked about, given our share gains, our portfolio and where we're selecting to play. Do you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur : Yes. On the mil/aero side, the move to phased-array radar-based systems for both civil and defense-related applications, your guys' dollar content per engagement goes up there, I think, pretty significantly. And I think that there's only one other competitor in that space. Have some of these programs started to fire? Or is it more of a 2019 driver? And then if you can just remind us of the dollar content step-up relative to prior-generation architectures. Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, look, there's many, many different subapplications within the aerospace and defense area. And I would say the recent history and the prognosis for those sectors remain strong in terms of the digitalization, fleet upgrades, for example, in the aerospace area. And we've highlighted in past conversations the area of these phased-array antenna systems, digitalizing the old analog radar systems used in civil and commercial aircraft systems. The content gain there goes from -- we believe, the SAM goes from probably $100,000 in the past to probably $2 million in the future, somewhere in between, depending on the types of architectures and deployments. So the upside demand we're seeing for these phased-array systems and the opportunity is very, very compelling. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Okay. Thank you all for joining us this quarter. As always, Mike is available for those of you who are unable to get through on today's Q&A session. Jennifer, we can wrap up the call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be archived in the Investors section of our website. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our commentary about ADI's second quarter financial results will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules, which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com. Okay. So with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the second quarter of fiscal '18 was remarkable for ADI. We posted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and set a new high-water mark in free cash flow generation, and I'm pleased to share some perspective on our results with you now. So revenue in the second quarter came in just above the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors, offset the expected decline in Consumer. Our results were also supported by our Linear Tech franchise, which posted a record revenue quarter. Gross and operating margin expanded substantially compared to the year ago quarter, driving a more than 40% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. This execution resulted in record free cash flow in the quarter, and our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continue to place us in the highest tier of the S&P 500. Now before we go deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to take this opportunity to provide investors with a deeper perspective on some of our key technology and market trends and ADI's strategy relative to them. I've spoken before about the dawn of the third wave of information and communications technology or ICT, which is characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity. In this world, digital systems increasingly rely on real-world information to make mission-critical decisions, and the accuracy and the integrity of this information is becoming more and more important. Simultaneously, the actual challenge of identifying and extracting signals in the presence of increasing levels of noise is becoming harder. Now I believe that this is creating an inflection in the analog industry, and it's enabling ADI to play a critical role in generating and communicating high-quality information to leverage our cutting-edge innovation and solutions to tackle our customers' hardest problems from sensor to cloud, microwave to bits and nanowatts to kilowatts. It's our ability to sense, measure, interpret, power and connect these 2 worlds that is helping to enable autonomous machines, natural human to machine interaction and future important technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality and so on. Today, though, I'd like to talk more specifically about connectivity and 5G, which has been the subject of much news coverage lately and which represents the next big investment phase in wireless infrastructure and how we view its evolution and timing. In fact, an entirely new wireless and wireline network architecture will ultimately be needed to meet the demands for orders of magnitude increases in bandwidth-hungry areas such as high-definition video streaming. Although 5G will provide revolutionary capabilities, the transition to 5G will be evolutionary. We see the first phase of this evolution being the addition of massive MIMO, which will provide a significant increase to the capacity of the current 4G wireless network. The use case and benefits of massive MIMO to the carriers are real. A massive MIMO system can deliver a greater than 3x data capacity increase in the same spectrum as a current 4G base station. And this helps to solve 2 large challenges for carriers : capacity and cost. ADI is enabling these massive MIMO implementations today through our highly integrated software-defined transceiver platform. This solution reduces the radio card area by a factor of 10 and overall remote radio head footprint by 50% while simultaneously reducing power consumption. These are critical success factors with massive MIMO systems since they use, on average, 8x the number of radios compared to today's systems. Equally important, these transceivers have the flexibility to operate from 300 megahertz to 6 gigahertz as they are software programmable, giving our customers a single platform-based design that can quickly be modified to operate in any of the many different cellular bands that exist around the world. These radios can also scale from small cells to macro base stations to massive MIMO radios, and they offer a flexible architecture capable of rightsizing the analog and digital performance needed by a customer's product family. However, to realize the longer-term 5G ambition, further network change is needed. In order to further expand the network bandwidth, millimeter wave solutions will come into play in order to provide multi-gigabit per second wireless connectivity using phased-array solutions. In that arena, ADI is leveraging the capabilities from our Hittite acquisition. We have a very unique market position of having deep competency from antenna to bits up through millimeter waves, and our solutions and technologies are well positioned in the current millimeter wave trials around the world. This will expand ADI's sun as it emerges. In addition to adding massive MIMO and millimeter waves, 5G will require a complete re-architecting of the core wireless and wireline network, including a move toward network virtualization and more edge computing. This backbone network will be required to meet the 5G vision of greater than 1 gigabit per second download speeds, low latency and high reliability demanded by mission-critical applications such as digital health care, autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous factory floors and augmented reality systems. This network expansion will drive a significant upgrade of the backhaul system, opening a new stream of opportunity for ADI's optical and point-to-point microwave solutions. 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling technology through our comprehensive portfolio of high-performance mixed signal, RF and microwave and power management technologies. The combination and integration of these innovative capabilities will allow us to create even more comprehensive and compelling signal chain solutions for our customers and the opportunity to capture up to 3x the [ baum ] when compared to our 4G solutions. Now while we're obviously excited about the remarkable potential of 5G, the greater volume of our communications business in the next couple of years will still be 4G. And here, our business is strong and has been growing at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth has significantly outpaced industry CapEx spend as we have seen share gains in traditional 4G macro products, thanks to new RF offerings resulting from the combined strength of our ADI and Hittite engineering teams. Those results have been augmented by strong adoption of our integrated software-defined transceivers across macro, small cells and massive MIMO trials. So in summary, we feel very confident and energized by our communications market success, which is built upon close partnerships with our customers, our domain knowhow, our unwavering desire to solve the toughest engineering challenges and strategic investments in research and development, along, of course, with our acquisitions of Hittite and Linear Technology. So looking forward, we expect to continue to outperform in the communications market and accelerate our growth as we fully address our customers' needs well into the 5G future. Of course, 5G is just one of the many areas ADI is taking advantage of in the era of digitalization. In this ubiquitously sensed and connected world, there are many exciting new opportunities, areas such as industrial 4.0, autonomous and electric transportation and cloud computing. And in future earnings calls, I'll continue to speak to these opportunities with you and look forward to sharing how we are creating long-term value for our customers and for our shareholders. And so with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Revenue for the quarter was just over $1.51 billion, above the high end of our guidance and increasing 25% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially on a 13-week basis. Now before I move on to the rest of the P&L, let me give you some commentary around our market performance in the quarter. Looking at the combined company, our B2B revenue increased 14% year-over-year led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 52% of sales in the quarter. Growth in this market was once again broad based, with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. Momentum continues as our targeted R&D investments aimed at the underlying sector trends of automation, instrumentation and health care continue to drive outperformance. Turning to the comms market, which represented 19% of sales in the second quarter. Sales into both wireless and wired applications increased compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth is due to share gains related to our complete portfolio of high performance mixed signal RF and microwave as well as the strong demand for our integrated transceiver and our position on virtually all of the 5G and massive MIMO trials. As Vince mentioned, we expect to grow our comms revenue at a mid-single-digit rate in the backdrop of a flat CapEx environment ahead of 5G rollout, and 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI as we are positioned to provide the enabling technology with our comprehensive portfolio. Our auto business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. After a better than seasonal first quarter, second quarter sales increased at a low single-digit rate compared to the year-ago quarter, with growth led by the infotainment and powertrain applications. And finally, our Consumer business represented 13% of sales in the second quarter, and as previously communicated, decreased compared to our year ago quarter. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margins of 71.3% came in around the midpoint of guidance and increased slightly compared to the first quarter on a more favorable mix. OpEx in the second quarter was $442 million or approximately 29% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution delivered operating margins above 42% and at the upper end of our guidance. Non-op expenses in the second quarter were $62.5 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $58 million in our third quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 5% as we adjusted the tax rate for the full year to 6%. Looking to the third and fourth quarters, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate will remain between 5% to 7%. There is no change to our expectation for fiscal 2019, and we continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be approximately 12%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.45, increasing over 40% year-over-year. Now I'll cover the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory decreased 2% sequentially and days were 116 in the quarter, down from 124 days in the first quarter. Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, which is flat sequentially and up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated record free cash flow of approximately $665 million in the quarter, with associated free cash flow margins of 44%. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined enterprise was $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we paid down $450 million of debt, which helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2x, down from the 2.4x in the prior quarter. We expect to achieve our 2x leverage ratio within the next 2 quarters. Capital additions in the second quarter were $54 million, and we expect CapEx for fiscal '18 to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. And during the quarter, we paid $178 million in dividends, with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. So let's now turn to our outlook and expectations for the third quarter of fiscal '18, which with the exception of revenue are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting third quarter to look a lot like second quarter. We're planning for revenue in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase approximately 10% year-over-year. We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. And we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up $10 million year-over-year. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales of approximately 29%. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the third quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 41% to 43% and for diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.52. So to wrap it up, this was another terrific quarter for ADI, and we set a few records along the way. Our B2B business increased double digits year-over-year, and our strong operational execution drove gross and operating margins higher, which resulted in a record free cash flow in the quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Now let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Jennifer, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : First question for Vince. You talked about participating in 5G trials. Could you elaborate a little bit more on that? It sounded like you're participating in pretty much all of them out there. But if you could give some context, that would be great. Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks, Tore. Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, there are really kind of 2 phases to 5G, at least from an ADI perspective. There is the pre-millimeter phase and the millimeter phase. And the pre-millimeter phase is really dominated by this massive MIMO expansion, which is really an overlay on 4G. So our software-defined transceivers are absolutely everywhere in the systems that are being brought to market this year and next year. In fact, it's one of the fastest-growing product sectors inside ADI. So that's been a very strong contributor to our communications business and, in fact, beyond. These transceiver technologies, because they're so flexible, are usable as well in places beyond communications. Also, the combination of Hittite and ADI from RF to bits and microwave to bits is enabling us to capture new content in kind of pre-5G systems. But it's the combination of our massive MIMO, our Hittite ADI microwave and millimeter wave to bits technology that is enabling us to be participating in virtually all these field trials across the globe. My sense, Tore, is that U.S. and China will be in the kind of '19, '20 time frame. We'll be at least trialing some particular applications. China will get faster to mass market, I think, with what they call 5G, which is really to me, 4.5G plus massive MIMO. So I hope that explains what it is we're doing. And in the run up to what will be pure 5G in the 2024, 2025 time frame where the core network gets changed with virtualization, edge computing and pure millimeter wave-type technologies, spanning multiple different frequency levels. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Tore. Do you have a follow up? Tore Svanberg : Yes, just a follow up for Prashanth. Prashanth, with the gross margin being up year-over-year, is that mainly a function of mix? Or is there any other contributors there? I mean, obviously, the revenues are slightly higher. But is the main upside to gross margin year-over-year coming from mix? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Well, Tore, remember that we have now completed the implementation of all of our synergies related to the acquisition of Linear. So we now have built into our run rate the cost synergies that we committed to at the time of the acquisition. So that is contributing as well to the gross margin strength. And then I would also say that with volumes where they are, we're getting the benefit of strong utilization at our internal fabs. Michael Lucarelli : I'd just add that, we have an additional $100 million of cost synergies we talked about. So the $150 million is complete, and we still have another $100 million on the comm. We'll take our next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Can you hear me? Vincent Roche : Yes, John. You're a little faint, but good morning. John Pitzer : Vince, I really appreciate all the color on the comms business. But I want to talk a little bit about your auto business. You had really strong growth in the January quarter that decelerated pretty significantly in the April quarter, which was a little bit surprising, especially, I think, you said in your prepared comments that the Linear business was achieving new all-time records. So I'm just kind of curious, you've kind of been undergrowing your peers in auto, which was explainable over multiple years because of the MEMS part of your business. But that should be a fairly small part of the business now. So I'm just kind of curious as to what's holding back growth in that market, and how you kind of feel your long-term position is in the auto space. Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks, John. So look, our business right now, our long-term goal is to grow at the high end of kind of 2 to 3 SAAR. And our objective, obviously, is to get the combined company onto that trajectory. So obviously, we're performing below my expectations, and we're not happy as a management team right now as to where we are. But let me try and unpack this story a bit for you and bring you through where we are right now and what the pathway ahead is going to be. So we were clear in our last call that the profiles for ADI and LTC are quite different in the automotive sector today. ADI, we -- the ADI legacy business increased at the kind of level of 2 to 3 SAAR in '17. And it looks like we're on track again this year to achieve that kind of level. Whereas the LTC growth level has been in the low single digits or closer to kind of 1 SAAR. So -- but what I will tell you is that we're making a lot of progress in improving LTC's growth rates, and we've uncovered a lot of revenue synergy opportunities. And we've also changed the business logic within LTC and tilted more towards growth. Profitability has always been important, will always be important, but we're also tilting more aggressively towards growth. But as you know, in this market, it just takes time to materialize the design wins that we've got in place. And my sense is those design wins won't materially impact the revenue, will not materially impact the revenue for a couple of years. What I'd like to do is just turn my attention now to giving you a sense for what momentum we have in our business and what we're doing to get our revenue towards -- to get the growth levels to the higher end of the 2 to 3 SAAR. And as you know, we've talked before, we have 3 primary application areas in our business : infotainment, autonomous driving and electrification. I'm going to talk to those in a little bit of detail and try to unpack the story a bit for you. So in infotainment, we've won a lot of premium audio sockets. That's a great heritage for ADI across all geos, and that's really the foundation of the infotainment business. And the good news there is we're now beginning to attach LTC power to the clusters of ADI, DSP and mixed-signal technologies. We've talked before as well about our A2B technologies, and we're really getting a lot of momentum there. And what I can tell you is that about a dozen OEMs are planning to deploy that technology in the next few years across the globe in many, many geos. Now that is also -- everything I talk about here is an opportunity for LTC power attachment. If I turn to autonomous vehicles. We haven't really talked much before about our LIDAR solution, but we're gaining design ins today in long and short-range LIDAR systems, with both the ADI mixed-signal technologies and the LT portfolios and even getting some sockets for Hittite in the very, very high-frequency areas. These components complement the more advanced capability that we're working on now to produce a solid-state beam steering and photodetector technology. And that will dramatically drive the size, the cost, the power, and we believe enable, over the longer term, the kind of mid- to long-term 3, 4, 5 years, mass deployment of LIDAR. And we got that new technology in terms of that more integrated system capability through the acquisition of Vescent sometime last year. Also in autonomous vehicles, we have several design ins in place with our inertial management units, our IMUs, as we call them. And we're engaged today on almost every self driving platform that is in development today, both with what we would call traditional OEMs and some disruptors out there as well. So that technology, which we've been using, we've gained traction in mission-critical aerospace areas, for example. It's a really ideal fit to the emerging autonomous vehicle requirements and it's used as a failsafe function in the event of a radar system failure. And I will turn to the electrification side of things and our BMS business, which we got from our LTC acquisition. We've been winning back business that we might have lost or have lost and by changing, again, our business logic, as I talked a little earlier about, to tilting towards growth, defending our sockets aggressively and also leveraging the scale and flexibility of the ADI manufacturing system to change the kind of the cost profile of the products. And we're broadening LTC's customer base, bringing that technology into the strong relationships that legacy ADI has in North America and with European OEMs. Also, our next-generation BMS will improve on our already leading performance levels by delivering, again, more miles per charge and bringing all the robustness and safety features to play as well. And one other aspect of the electrification business is the momentum that we have, in our isolation we have a franchise of very unique isolation technologies that tend to get used anytime that there's a high-voltage and low-voltage connection. So these technologies are very important in electrical vehicles, so I think we're doing well there. And not to mention the broad-based revenue synergies that we've got on the power side of things. My sense is that in a reasonable period of time, we should be able to add a point or two of overall growth to the automotive business, given the design cycles that we've got and the strength of the power portfolio. So I think we're very focused on bending the growth curve. I believe we're focused on the right apps, the right customers. We have a terrific technology story. And with the complementary customer bases and geo footprint coverage, I feel very optimistic about the future and our ability to get that growth curve to where we have publicly said it should be and will be. So I know that's a long answer, John, but I thought it was important to give the story in terms of where we are today and talk a little bit about the future as well. Operator : Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : Thanks especially for the robust answers, in particular around wireless and 5G. But there's a controversy brewing in that market with these decisions around ZTE as to whether you might or might not be able to ship components to them. I'm wondering -- 2 questions around that. One, what do your -- what does your outlook assume in terms of sales to ZTE going forward? And second, how would a stop ship order to ZTE influence your view as to the growth of that market, overall? In particular, might you see a sort of slowdown of adoption in China if they don't have 2 local champions? Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks for the question. So the way we view it in the short term, there's a certain amount of fixed CapEx in place to upgrade the various networks across the globe and particularly in China. So my sense is that there are many other competitors in play who will fill the demand for building out the networks across the globe. We have factored into our numbers a potential continued embargo with regard to ZTE, so it's built into our numbers. It was a small amount of headwind for the company last quarter. So I think, overall, most geos are up in communications for ADI, we're gaining share. You know, my sense is as well, just we're obviously staying close to the situation as best we can tell, the negotiation outcomes that are taking place. But I will tell you, clearly, U.S. and China need each other. And I think trade between both is very, very critical. My sense is that sense will prevail and the need for free trade, unencumbered trade will prevail. And we're expecting political leaders to figure this out. So my sense is at the end of the day, there's demand there for more and more connectivity. Carriers are determined to keep building their networks out, to capture the opportunity to build their revenue and profit streams. And that demand is going to be fulfilled one way or the other. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : A question on Consumer. You appear to be navigating the falloff at your largest customer. So just from kind of a high level, if you can just talk about the puts and takes from some of the drop-off there versus other opportunities and areas where you're actually growing within Consumer. Vincent Roche : Yes, so as you know, Craig, our Consumer business is a tale of 2 -- we've got 2 different stories there. One is our prosumer, which looks a lot like our B2B market, with lots of customers, products and different applications globally. And that business has been strengthened as well with the addition of the LTC revenue and applications. And that's in the $300 million-plus area, so it's a significant portion of Consumer for ADI. We're expecting, looking into our -- somewhere in the back end of third quarter and fourth quarter, we're expecting what is normally a seasonally strong quarter to be so. We've stated previously that Consumer will be down 20% to 30% for the year, and this is how the year appears to be trending now. So our strategy remains the same, to focus -- or to leverage our technologies into areas of very, very high differentiation where we can get a higher return on investment. And we continue to execute against that strategy. Michael Lucarelli : Craig, do you have a follow up? Craig Hettenbach : I do. Just a question on free cash flow and kind of capital allocation for Prashanth. So encouraging to see the big step-up in free cash flow in the quarter. As you're on the doorstep of that 2 turns target for net leverage, can you remind us in terms of just priorities, be it acquisitions versus returning cash and how you think about that? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Thanks for the question, Craig. So yes, it was a great quarter for us in free cash flow, but I do want to remind folks that our cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. So the right way to measure us is on a trailing 12 month, and we finished this quarter with trailing 12 month of $1.9 billion. So we recognize that this franchise throws off a considerable amount of cash and, therefore, we want to be very thoughtful on how we deploy that excess cash once we achieve our 2x leverage ratio, which we would expect to do in the next 2 quarters. We're very mindful of the debt that we took on as a result of the Linear acquisition as well as the opportunities that we have in front of us with the share repurchase dividend and potentially some other uses as well. So it's something that we spend some quite a bit of time internally debating. And I think you'll hear from us in a coming earnings release that we're ready to talk more about our capital allocation strategy once we clear that important 2x threshold. Operator : Our next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, if I could combine my questions into one large one. On the industrial side, could you share with us a little bit more detail in terms of what the drivers were there underlying that superb growth. And then can you talk about the sustainability of that growth going forward? And then longer term, as part of revenue synergies with Linear, clearly, auto has been a major focus. So could you kind of, I guess, help us see what kind of underlying growth we could see from top line synergies in that segment looking out the next 1, 2, 3 years? Vincent Roche : Yes, great. Thanks for the questions, C.J. So the industrial business has been doing extraordinarily well, as you mentioned. We continued to be driving this with the technology investments that we've made. It is across the board, C.J. It is all geographies, it is all products. So this is really a combination of the strength of a global expanding environment, and you know the PMI continues to be in an expansionary phase. And that's compounded by the technology investments that have been made over the last several years, which have now come together at a time where you can really see the driver in automation, you can see the driver in our instrumentation business. So it's really across the board, and it's hard to point to any one particular segment because it is so broad based and it's a reflection of the investments that have been made over the last several years. From where we sit today, and you can see it reflected in our guidance for the coming quarter, we feel very strong about the coming quarter. The outlook is solid. Our book-to-bill is greater than 1. Information from the channels, the information Vince gets from his customer visits are all continuing to tell us that we're going to see this run for a bit longer. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, C.J. And I'll just remind you, our long-term growth in that business, we say, is over 2x GDP. If you look at the 5-year CAGR in that business, it's right up -- it's about 8%, 9%. So that's kind of the long-term growth for that business, and we think that's a great growth for -- it's 50% of our business and it throws off great cash. Do you have a follow up, C.J.? Actually, you fit in 2 questions there. Let's move to the next caller. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Christopher Caso : The first question, a little bit of a big picture question. And based on your -- the comments from the prior question, it sounds like you do have a good degree of conviction that these favorable conditions will continue. Can you talk about visibility you have into customer inventory levels into the channel inventory? And generally, with -- amid the strong industry conditions, the ability you have to make sure that customers are ordering in line with their needs and not over ordering at this point. Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks for the question. So first, as a reminder, we have not moved to ASC 606, so remember that our revenue is recognized on sell-through from the channel. So we really do provide our investors a reflection of what is the actual activity happening at the customer level. The inventory that we're seeing in our channel now, roughly 7.5 weeks, that's relatively consistent with where we have been. And we would expect, just through the normal course of business and over the course of the rest of the fiscal year, we'd expect to see that come down a bit. The inventory that we have in-house is at 116 days. That's an improvement of about 8 days from where we were in the first quarter. We are comfortable kind of in that 115 to 120, so I think that's where you'll see us for the balance of the period. Our sales organization does work very closely with channel partners to monitor that order activity to ensure that we're being mindful of the order lead times and ensuring that, that behavior is appropriate. But again, the biggest metric for us is -- the revenue we're reporting is on sell-through, so it's really not impacted by any noise in the channel, whether they're building or subtracting from inventory. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, just another bit of color on that. All the macro dynamics that we talked about that I used in the -- I talked about at the start of my prepared remarks there benefit the industrial sector. So my sense is, from talking to customers globally, as has been the case at least for the last couple of years, they're pragmatically optimistic about the future that we're in a longer-term secular growth trend across the various applications in industrial. And I think the optimism is even across automation, instrumentation and the aerospace and defense areas. So I think our customers are feeling good. And I'm also feeling very, very good about where we are and where the market is. Operator : Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Vince, thanks for all the wireless comms commentary earlier in the call. Just wanted to level set. How does your 20% roughly comms business split between wireless and the wired side? And given that you gave us all that color on the wireless side, I wondered what your expectations were for the wired part of the equation. Vincent Roche : Good question, Ross. Thank you. Well, today, with the acquisition of LT, our business now is about 50-50 between wireless and wireline. The wireless business, my sense is that can grow in the high single digits for quite a while to come. That's my long-term growth objective in that business. Wired is somewhere in the kind of mid-single digits as it has been growing, and I think that's a reasonable way to balance the growth expectations across that business. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow up, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yes, and I'll make it a quick one for you. Vince, you mentioned a few times in this call about changing the business model at Linear to be a little bit more growth-centric. Can you give us an idea, given the long-term design cycles, and I know it's not going to be immediate, but when should we as investors start to see the benefits of those tweaks to the admittedly successful Linear model turning to a little bit more growth-centric? Vincent Roche : Yes, I think the areas where we believe that we'll see the growth uptake in the shorter term, kind of over the next 2 years, that will be in the probably communications as well as automotive areas. We have sockets already in place now that we should see the uptake on. And it's going to take -- to get to what I would consider to be the objective to put a couple points more of total growth on the company's top line, it will take in the kind of 3 -- 2- to 4-year kind of area. And if Hittite is any indication, given that the technologies play in similar markets, we're virtually 4 years into the closure of the Hittite acquisition. And over that period of time, we have managed to double the growth rates of Hittite in that period of time. So given, Ross, that we expect for every dollar of ADI revenue, which is largely mixed-signal base, we expect $1 of power. That's the kind of opportunity spread we're looking at, but it's going to take us 2 to 4 years, I think, to see any meaningful change to the top line. Operator : And our final question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : I wanted to follow up on Ross's comment and maybe take a longer-term look at the 5G opportunity that's in front of ADI. If we look back at the transition from 2G to 3G, and then 3G to 4G, as you look ahead and look at 5G and the potential for 5G to impact ADI revenues, the questions I have are, one, how do you expect pacing in the 4G to 5G revenue transition to compare to prior transitions? When do you think we get to a point where 5G would be a majority of communications revenue? And relative to some of the growth rates that you talked about earlier on a subsegment basis, would you expect 5G when it becomes a much more material part of revenues, to accelerate those growth rates? Vincent Roche : Good question, Craig. And if you consider 5G to be the initial introduction of 5G to be adding massive MIMO to 4G core network, I think we'll see meaningful revenue in the 2020 time frame. And I still think that 4G, without massive MIMO, will be a significant portion of revenue into the kind of 2022 timeframe. So somewhere between 2022 and 2025, we'll start to see what we will consider to be 5G become a more dominant part of our wireless communications infrastructure revenue. So at this point, Craig, it's a bit of a guess based on trying to triangulate on all the various conversations we have with carriers and customers. But I think, clearly, we're starting to see the uptick in 4.5G, or as it's called in China, 5G, massive MIMO based on 4G infrastructure at this point. So hopefully, that helps to give a bit of clarity to you. Michael Lucarelli : Okay. Thank you, Jennifer. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be archived in the Investor section of our website. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today about ADI's third quarter financial results will also include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude special items. When comparing our third quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules, which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com. Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Analog Devices, well, we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers, helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment. It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long term. In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise. Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. We also delivered very strong free cash flow, generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin. ADI's cash-generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal 3 quarters ahead of plan, and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases. Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities. On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation. For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies, higher quality, more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This smart factory, in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant, will use additional data for decentralized decision-making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a mass deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge. For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go to edge solution provider. The place where the data is born, so to speak, and I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing, signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years. In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support. Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and where the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead, broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software. At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and FAEs, and the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities at current customers and increase penetration at new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come. For decades, our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end markets such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage and many, many others, and this is a long life cycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry. With a broader set of technologies and capabilities, our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC adds high-performance power to our already extensive portfolio, enabling further innovation. And in fact, power plays an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers as they further automate in space and energy-constrained areas. For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to 8 analog outputs on a card, previously unachievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density. Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low-voltage electronics as well as humans from high voltages. Traditionally, customers have used optical technology to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology. So with unique architectures and leading process technology, our iCoupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor. We also remove customers' industry certification pain with ready-to-use solutions, accelerating their time-to-market. As a result of all that, we have shipped over 2 billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double-digits annually. Today, as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base, they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on 2 examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI. The first is robotics. Across all geographies, significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor-intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots commonly known as cobots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large-scale industrial robotics industry remains healthy and growing, the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth. Collectively, this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually, adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022. ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large-scale robots as well as the fast-growing cobots segments. Along with our traditional precision-control technology solutions, including signal chains and digital isolation, we effectively more than triple our content opportunity with the addition of power management, communications and sensors. The second area of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here, robots operate in tandem with many other systems, including PLC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago, ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software configurable I/O architecture based on our high-performance precision signal processing portfolio. With this breakthrough in innovation, ADI created a disruptive capability, allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment. In addition to flexibility, the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include 8 weeks on average faster installation time, savings on engineering and a significant reduction in factory space. Factory production flows can be adapted more easily, and these changes that could traditionally take hours, can now be done in minutes. With this new capability, we've increased our SAM by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins at leading customers over the past year, we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline. As we look towards the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics will enable the transformation of manufacturing. With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine health, robustness and security. Working closely with our customers, we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges. In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless networking technology, ADI is enabling the transition to newer secure connectivity architectures. We are leading the path to higher bandwidth industrial-ready Ethernet, using the latest time-sensitive networking standards. ADI's industrial deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness and the security required in the hostile environment of the digital factory. Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data, enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth, optical and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans while vibration, electrical and temperature sensors are used for condition-based monitoring, predicting the mechanical wear of the machines to maximize factory uptime. So to summarize, at the edge of the factory floor where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years, and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation and growth. While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for control and precision, our new investments double our SAM and allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All in all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world. So with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financials. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018 earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record-setting quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double digits year-over-year. Growth in this market continues to be broad based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year-ago quarter. As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades, and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next-generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity. In the communications market, which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double-digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO. This better market environment combined with our strong position across carriers with our high performance mixed signal and RF portfolio positions our comms business for continued growth and outperformance. Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate compared to a year ago, with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again, increasing high single digits year-over-year. And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter and as expected, decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications. Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 70 bps year-over-year, and given the mix of business, were down slightly sequentially. OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million or 28.5% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%. Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million, and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially, and days were 112 in the quarter, down 4 days from the second quarter. Disti inventory was just above 7.5 weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12 months' free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x. Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million, and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock. All in all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase in the low double digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx, as a percentage of sales, will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 40% to -- excuse me, 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%. And based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58. Now before we move to the Q&A session, I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 2x leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter, just 16 months post closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt or nearly 1/3 of the debt we raised for the deal. During the same period, we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. With this milestone achieved, we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans. Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business, whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth. Given the profitability of this franchise, the long-term prospects for our business and the benefits from U.S. tax reform, we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. Under this framework, the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15 times over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually. As you saw in yesterday's press release, we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and over time, lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment. So to wrap it up, this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4, and the early achievement of our 2x leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program. And with that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Can you hear me now? Vincent Roche : We hear you fine, Craig. Yes. Craig Hettenbach : Perfect. Just a question on B2B. Understanding it's double digits in aggregate, there have been some moving pieces between segments, particularly kind of autos and comms. So any color as you look into the October quarter? Just a little bit more granular between the comm business, industrial and autos for the October quarter? Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, look, Craig, B2B remains very strong. We've had a couple of stellar years of growth and we remain in a strong zone here. The growth has been led primarily by industrial and comms. And that's, as you know, 70% of our business today. So I'd say at this point, inventory is in very good shape, well managed on our balance sheets, it's in good shape in the channel and I'd say lead times are stable as well. And our overall guidance implies, as Prashanth said, our second -- our seventh consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth in B2B. So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. It's, I think, over the foreseeable future, industrial will perform in the 2x to 3x GDP area, probably at the higher end of that. Clearly, comms is -- ADI's position in 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G, and we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have, the penetration we have at the key customers in wireless communications infrastructure, I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless comms side of the business. Also, there's a significant upgrade cycle taking place in the kind of the backhaul, the optical backhaul. So I foresee see that, again, given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have, we'll see some decent growth there, too. We've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that, that will continue to perform in the kind of the mid-single-digit growth level and so it's, I'd say, moderate but a very, very important part of what we're doing. Operator : Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I just wanted to focus on the gross margin side. I get the mix change, consumer was stronger, at least kind of what -- versus what we were modeling, so it came in a little bit lighter versus what you had guided to, Prashanth. But if you look at the guide, that seems a little bit lighter as well. So can you just help us understand the puts and takes on gross margin, please? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Absolutely, Ambrish. Thanks for the question. So recall that our gross margin model is to be above 70%, which is industry-leading, and we're above that goal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right, margins were slightly lower. The upside driven by communications and consumer and the result was our industrial mix declined to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter levels. And then as we look to the fourth quarter, very similar to what Vince just told Craig, our strongest growth is going to come from comms and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margin, but still well above our model. And I will remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies, which should start layering in towards the beginning of 2021, late 2020, so we still expect to be able to continue to drive gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then, overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we can keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses, we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business. Thanks for the question, Ambrish. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Just one quick follow-up to that. Prashanth was talking about the fastest growth, here's to -- sequentially, on a year-over-year basis, the strongest growers were once again the industrial and communications, which both grow in the double digits. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : My question is just a little bit on the consumer side. If I back into kind of using the B2B guidance for Q4 to be up kind of low double digits, you kind of back into the consumer number, which puts consumer down about 20% for the full year, which is kind of at the high end of the range of the down 20 to 30 that you guys have been talking about at the Analyst Day -- the low end of the range, sorry. I'm just kind of curious, does that now reflect the new base off of which you guys can grow that consumer business? Or were there some things that happened this year that means that as we move into FY '19, you might still have some headwinds to work through in that consumer business with that one large customer? Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think what you've implied is just about right, John. At this point, it's very, very hard to say what will happen next year. So we've got a good read on what the number will be this year in terms of the decline in the portable business. It's very hard to tell what '19 will look like quite yet, but it's a fast cycle business and we win designs and you can lose designs as well in a very, very short period of time. But I would say to directly answer your question, as it stands today, the consumer business hasn't yet troughed in '18, so we'll see some further decline in the portable part, I believe, in 2019. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Whilst your industrial and communication segments are doing quite well, but auto is at kind of this low to mid-single-digit growth, remains below the peer group. Can you give us a sense of what has been done so far to perhaps fix some of the issues, what needs to be done so that you can get back to the high single-digit or double-digit growth rate that a number of your competitors are growing at? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks for the question. So the numbers that we've talked about are the combined legacy ADI and LTC. The legacy ADI part of the business is growing in the high single-digit area and the LT part in the low single-digits arena. So there are 2 primary components, I would say, that we're working hard to correct, particularly on the legacy LT side of things. Number one is making sure that our BMS business, the Battery Management business, gets back onto a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made there, particularly in the last 2 quarters, holding on to the sockets that we had and finding new sockets across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe in the electric powertrain. And we've also got a crop of new products coming, I think, that are very, very exciting. And also on the power side of things, we're more aggressive. We -- we're leveraging the ADI cost base where we've got fundamentally better cost structures to make sure that we take our unfair share of high-performance power sockets across the globe. So I think it's fair to say that we'll be in this mid-single-digit growth area, depending on the market, of course, for the next 1.5 years, 2 years. But somewhere in the 2020 area, I expect us to see a meaningful bend upwards in the growth curve. Operator : Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein  Research. Stacy Rasgon : I just wanted to get back to the segment growth. Were you trying to imply that everything is actually growing? I know you give some differences in sequential growth versus year-over-year growth across the segments, but are you still implying that everything is, I guess, I would come with everything like -- are you still trying to say everything is flat to up sequentially? Or you still have some B2B segments that could be down sequentially, even driving double-digit year-over-year growth? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: No. Stacy, you got it right. Everything, as we move from Q3 to Q4, is up sequentially. The -- what you do see is stronger growth up sequentially. And as you know, we don't guide by segments anymore, but what you do see is stronger growth coming sequentially from comms and automotive. And that is driving some mix impact overall, which gets back to -- I think it was Ambrish's question. Stacy Rasgon : I guess, my only issue, it seems to take me above your B2B growth. Although maybe you're suggesting, when you say low double digits, you're more than like 10%, I guess, is what you have to be implying with that guidance. Michael Lucarelli : Correct. I think it -- if it was 10%, we would have said 10%. And low double digits, to me, means probably anywhere between 10% and 12%. That's how I think about it, Stacy. Operator : Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : A question for Vince. On the industrial market, you said it's slowing. Is that just a function of getting back to the mean from some very strong year-over-year growth rates? Is it seasonality or are you seeing anything else going on in that end market? Vincent Roche : Good question, Tore. So I think from a global standpoint, what we see is that the macro economy is mainly constructive right now. You've seen PMI and GDP remain solid across the globe, the PMIs and GDP. I've spoken with several customers and they remain optimistic as well about the future. So I'd say, in industrial business now is good. As I mentioned earlier, there have been some pockets of slower growth, I think driven by the uncertainties, primarily in the geopolitical arena and as people think through what the -- this tariff situation means for everybody, but I'd say demand is resilient. And as we have in our guidance for B2B, we've talked with double digit growth, again, here on an annual basis. So I would say, in general, the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY '17, our industrial business grew in the low 20s, low 20%. This year, it will be in the kind of mid-teens. And so what I'm implying is that given the tougher compares and given the environment right now, though demand is strong, I think we're getting to a more normalized 2x to 3x GDP growth level and probably at the higher end of that. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : I guess just one sort of summary question on the end markets. So Vince, you're kind of giving us the longer-term growth of auto and industrial. How about comms? So comm looks like it's going to grow sort of in the mid-double digits this year. What do you think that should be longer term? And then maybe as just a brief follow-on, given industrial is slowing, what should that mean for gross margins over the next several quarters? Should we think of them as sort of a flattish type of trajectory? Vincent Roche : Yes. Good questions, Chris. So at this point, I'd say given the product crop that we have and the penetration we've got and the secular trends in the wireless communications area in particular, my sense is that even though it's a very, very lumpy business when you look at it quarter-by-quarter, with 4G continuing to deploy with new architectures and 5G coming on board, my sense is that can be a double-digit kind of a 10% growth area for ADI for kind of the next 3, 4 years. That's my sense. The backhaul market, particularly the optical side of that, I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single-digit area. So a lot of that is driven by -- the market conditions are better. I think, in general, carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can. But as I said, we've got a great new product crop and we have deeper and wider penetration, not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI's signal chain. So my sense is I feel good about that market. And right now, even though prediction is a dangerous game, my sense is that we should be able to grow that business in the kind of the low, I would say, double-digit area for the foreseeable future. And I'll turn it over to Prashanth to answer the gross margin implication question. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. So Chris, the way that I'd guide you to think about gross margins longer term is, I think, sort of flattish from where we are. We are, as you know, we're still ahead of our long-term model of 70%. Our industrial business has very rich gross margins. Our comms business has great margins, but not as strong as the industrial. And as Vince mentioned, as we see more growth in that comms business, which is what we would expect for 2019, that is going to drive a little bit of mix on the margins. So probably more to be in line with flattish to what we're expecting Q4 to be. On top of that, so I do want to remind folks, we are looking at about $100 million of cost synergies that should be modeled in for future sort -- of in the late 2020, early 2021 closing both the facilities, the one in Singapore and the one in the Bay Area in Santa -- in California. Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Zhenghao Zhang : This is Jerry Zhang, on for Blayne. I just had a question on the pace of buybacks. So when should we expect the share count to eventually start trending lower? And also as a follow-up, how do you think about the plan for deleveraging going forward? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Jerry. So I guess, the way that I'd guide folks to think about the -- about our repurchase activity. I'll start with reminding everyone, we generate a lot of cash, $2 billion-plus on a trailing 12-month basis and we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in the S&P 500. About $700 million-plus of that is committed to the dividend, and as I mentioned, we're still targeting to grow that in the 5% to 10% annually as we've done for the past 14 years. So the dividend would account for, let's call it, mid- to high- 30s of our free cash flow. That leaves a fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to -- at a minimum, work to offset dilution. And then opportunistically, we're going to look to reduce share count over time. When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer in that, at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available, so $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand, and then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet and what do we need to do to maintain investment grade so we have the flexibility that we need. So given kind of the cash-generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt and we'll be mindful of what is the rate environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage. Operator : Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I had a question on M&A. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your appetite for further acquisitions now that Linear is integrated as part of ADI, and to the extent you do have aspirations to buy more assets down the line, if you can talk a little bit about the technologies or the conditions that you would look for in a business. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thank you. Well, our overall capital allocation framework, as Prashanth outlined, hasn't changed very much. The long-term value of our investments, both organic as well as inorganic, will continue to drive the long-term profitable growth trajectory for ADI. Our approach to acquisitions has been and will continue to be very disciplined. And at a very high level, our strategy is really focused on acquiring assets that improve our competitive moat, the breadth and depth of our competitive moat from an innovation standpoint. So our goal, really, is to acquire technologies and engineering capabilities that will enhance us, make our portfolio more complete to meet the demands of the markets and customers in the future, and basically increase our overall ability to deliver increasing value to our customers. That's the path we're on and that's the path we'll continue to be on. And you know, I'm not going to talk about specific targets, we've got a successful track record. And what we're looking at -- we're always looking, but our standards are very, very high. So this was the case when we acquired Hittite and Linear, LTC and also the myriad smaller things we've done over the last 3 or 4 years. So I'm very pleased with where we are now in terms of our overall portfolio, but we're always on the look as the markets evolve and customers' needs evolve. So hopefully, that gives you at least a philosophical view of how we think about M&A. Operator : And our final question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : My question is about revenue synergies. Can you update us, as it relates to revenue synergies for the Hittite acquisition, which is clearly a few years in the rearview mirror, but I think you're starting to see revenue synergies kick in there and what you anticipate with regard to the same issue with Linear. Vincent Roche : Yes. Good question. And in as much as Hittite can give an indication of what's possible with regard to LT, we've more than doubled. When we took Hittite on board, we've more than doubled the growth rate and we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers, bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio. So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And off a $270 million-ish starting revenue point, you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically, I'd say, 3 years to get to the point with Hittite, where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline. It takes a while to build it, it takes a while to convert it, just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack. I've said before that with LT, we are looking to make sure that for every dollar of mixed signal opportunity that ADI has, it's $4.5 billion-ish today, at today's kind of revenue levels, that legacy LT's power should be a one-for-one match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win. We're in early production stage, for example, in communications and automotive sectors, which we felt would be the 2 most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter term. So my sense is, again, getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of 3 to 4 years is a reasonable expectation. Michael Lucarelli : Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Today's commentary about ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal '18 financial results will be detailed further in our 10-K, which we expect to file next week. Our comments today about ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules, which we posted on the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com. Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to ADI CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company. We once again hit a high watermark by achieving record revenue of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded operating margins to 43% and delivered $1.55 of diluted earnings per share. Looking at the full year now, revenues surpassed $6 billion for the first time. Growth was led by our B2B markets that increased well into the double-digits year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased more than 20% year-over-year, and most notably, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. This robust cash generation enabled us to continue investing in the future of our business, rapidly reduced our debt by over $1.5 billion during the year and returned cash to our shareholders. As we outlined on the last call, going forward, we plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments. In fact, we've returned $10 billion to our shareholders since 2005 through dividends and share repurchases. Beyond being a strong year financially, it was also a year of exceptional business progress for ADI, also. So I'd like to spend a little time describing our progress in 2018 and show how specifically it positions ADI for continued strength in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. Firstly, we made tremendous progress in the integration of LTC using our best-of-both approach. Employees across the entire organization are unified and working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. Our R&D teams have synergized product roadmaps and development activities, and are busily extending the cutting edge of analog, mixed signal, power and sensors to deliver impactful solutions to our customers. Our combined sales force has made really great strides in building and converting our opportunity pipeline. In fact, our revenue cross-selling opportunity has doubled in value since our Analyst Day across large customers and also in the broad market. During the year, we successfully achieved our initial $150 million of cost synergies. In addition, as previously announced, we're optimizing our internal manufacturing footprint, reducing our cost basis by another $100 million, while enabling a more agile operation that is positioned to capture new growth upside. All that said, given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we're increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC's revenue growth over the next few years. In short, we've created an industry-leading product portfolio and team of analog, RF and power engineers with capabilities that range from sensor to cloud from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nanowatts to kilowatts. We exit 2018 in a stronger position than we've ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and, indeed, beyond. In addition to our own preparedness, our confidence is grounded in a few externalities that transcend any potential short-term uncertainty in 2019, namely: immutable technology macro trends that are creating secular tailwinds for ADI; ADI's analog expertise between the physical and digital domains becomes ever more critical to our customers' business success; and simultaneously, our customers are partnering more deeply with us to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product solutions to enable them to meet the innovation demands of their customers, and we're very well aligned with these externalities and have been making strong progress during the past year to position ourselves for success in 2019 and beyond. For example, in the wireless communication sector, you may have seen recent press around deployments of 5G massive MIMO beginning in Korea. ADI's software-defined transceivers are enabling those deployments, and this is just the beginning. Many other global carriers are expected to deploy 5G massive MIMO over the coming years. Much of the innovation of 5G systems is taking place in the radio subsystem. Given the increasing demands of -- for spectral space, thermal and cost efficiency, our comprehensive portfolio of software-defined mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies will enable ADI to create even more compelling solutions for our customers in the years ahead. These massive MIMO-enabled radios contain an 8x increase in radio channels, representing a significant growth opportunity for ADI and the opportunity to capture, potentially, up to 4x the content when compared to current 4G solutions. I should note also that in addition, power management attached assignments in this area are just beginning but progress thus far leads us to believe that our power portfolio will continue to provide tailwinds for us in communications in 2019 and in further years. And indeed, massive MIMO is just a stepping stone to millimeter-wave-based future generations. Here, carriers will look to increase the radio channel count up to 512 channels per radio and we're very well positioned to, once again, solve these immense radio challenges with our comprehensive cutting-edge portfolio. So I believe we're really in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle in this particular space. So now turning for a moment to the industrial sector. Here, the digital factory envisioned by industry 4.0 is expected to increase productivity and lower cost. ADI has the heritage, the domain expertise and the most comprehensive set of technologies and capabilities to deliver the required level of precision and robustness our customers need. For example, we're building beyond our traditional strength in precision control, isolation and power products by adding communications technologies, such as industrial-grade deterministic Ethernet and sensors in areas such as depth, motion and vibration, which more than triples our content opportunity and expands our addressable market.  In automotive, FY '18 was a year of really solid progress and I have increased conviction that we're on the right path to return to our target growth rate of at least high single digits annually. Growth in our cabin electronics business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate this past year, driven mainly by our long-term strength in audio processing. And our future is equally bright here. We're adding new vectors to our audio processing foundation, like A2B and C2B media transport technologies, and we're attaching our power management portfolio in these engagements as well, positioning us for continued strong growth in this particular subsector. On the active safety side of the business, high-speed signal processing technology is required to deliver ever-increasing levels of precision in Level 3-plus autonomous vehicles. Here, ADI's radar, LIDAR and IMU solutions, coupled with power management, are strengthening our position across nearly all self-driving programs. And as is the case -- as in the case with Baidu, our customers are relying on ADI to achieve their vision of fully autonomous vehicles. In the electrification application area, we've made stellar progress in strengthening our BMS solutions in FY '18. Our current generation delivers up to 20% more miles per charge compared to the competition and extends the batteries' useful life. We are now sampling our next-generation solution, which provides another efficiency and performance leap while adding additional safety features. Beyond that, the subsequent generation of our multigenerational roadmap includes architectural innovations that will change the way the BMS problems of power density, accuracy and weight are solved in the future. And finally, I'd like to say a few words about our health care business and progress. Revenue in this market has increased at a double-digit growth rate over the past 5 years, and I believe it's really just getting started. In areas such as remote patient monitoring and digital x-ray systems, ADI's expertise in high-performance sensing, signal processing and power control is ever more critical to our customers. For example, in the area of digital x-ray imaging, several years ago, we made a pivot to a domain-inspired approach to solve our customers' most difficult problems. We've leveraged our strong heritage of high-end component building blocks and have pushed the innovation curve to new levels to create highly integrated subsystems from photons to bits, for example. These solutions have simplified an intensely complex problem by reducing our customers' design challenges while lowering radiation dosage and simultaneously increasing image fidelity. We've thereby extended our addressable market to capture new levels of value. And in general, in the health care area, I believe that economic needs and new technology adoption are converging to enable a new vein of growth in the future for ADI. So in closing, I put forth a constructive scenario here today, and while some may be a bit skeptical given the present macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears that beset our world, our confidence, I believe, is very well-founded. We have a diverse business across customers, products and applications that positions us to succeed and excel in any macro climate. We've added enormously to our cutting-edge technology portfolio during the year and we've deepened our customer engagements. So we're in a position to capture the upside, while being agile enough to weather any perturbations in the marketplace. And amidst an environment of increasing change and complexity, we continue to leverage our greatest asset, our people, who continuously push the edge, learn and adapt to create ever more innovative solutions for our customers each and every day, which ultimately drives returns for our shareholders. And so with that, I'd like to hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q4 '18 earnings call. As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We wrap up 2018 with another record-setting quarter. Revenue at $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.55, and we converted this growth into strong cash flow generating over $2 billion on a trailing 12. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our fourth quarter B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The highly diverse industrial end-market represented 49% of the sales in the quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. Most sectors increased compared to the year-ago quarter led by strength in instrumentation, health care, aerospace and defense. As expected, this growth was moderated by slower demand in factory automation, mainly related to China. The comms market, which represented 22% of sales in the fourth quarter, increased once again at the double-digit rate year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both the wireless and wired markets. Growth in our wireless business was broad-based, and accelerated as continued momentum in our 4G business was augmented by early deployments of massive MIMO. We expect this to carry into 2019 and beyond as 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI. Our auto business represented 15% of sales in the quarter and increased at a low single-digit rate year-over-year. Growth was led by cabin electronics and the BMS application. And lastly, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year. However, portables declined less than expected. Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.6 billion, increasing 4% year-over-year. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 30 bps year-over-year and were flat sequentially. OpEx in the fourth quarter was $452 million and at approximately 28% of revenue, well within our target of sub-30. And finally, op margins were a record at 43%. As we continue to delever, non-op expenses in the fourth quarter declined to $56 million. And with our full year true-up, our Q4 tax rate was approximately 8%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in above the midpoint at about $0.55. Now moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 4% sequentially and days were 114 in the quarter, relatively flat from third quarter. Disti inventory declined sequentially and exited the year right in line with our target of 6 to 8 weeks. We generated free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion or 35% of sales over the trailing 12 months. And as of yesterday's closing price, our free cash flow yield is 6.8%. During the quarter, we repaid $225 million of debt and paid $179 million in dividends. And as we outlined in our last earnings call, we have resumed our share repurchase program, now that our leverage is sub-2. As of yesterday, we have purchased nearly 260 million worth of shares. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $86 million, and we expect to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales for 2019. Before I move on to guidance, I want to remind you that in January -- in the January quarter, we will adopt a new rev rec standard, ASC 606, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are among the last few SEC registrants to do so due to the timing of our fiscal year. We have historically deferred revenue and the related cost for shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell their products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we will recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributor. We plan to provide a historical, quarterly end-market revenue look back under the new standard with our first quarter 2019 earnings release. Meaning, you will see changes in our historical growth rates as they will reflect revenue from shipping into distribution versus shipping out. But for context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was pretty minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past 3 years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by plus or minus 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger. Now on to guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude the items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, so all of my comments on revenue growth and our commentary during the Q&A session will exclude this extra week, so we are normalizing our growth rates to give you a like-for-like comparison. First quarter revenue is expected to be $1.51 billion at the midpoint, on both the old and the new rev rec methodology. To be clear, we are forecasting a midpoint of $1.51 billion on both a sell-in or new ASC 606 standard as well as a sell-through basis because we expect minimal change in channel inventory during the first quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 7% year-over-year on a sell-through basis and we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase low double-digits year-over-year, led by the communications market. This would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets. Under the new rev rec method, year-over-year growth would be approximately 4% at a company level and at high single-digit rate in the B2B markets for the first quarter. We are planning for gross margins to be approximately 70.8, lower sequentially due to the normal shutdowns around the holidays as well as business mix. We're expecting operating expenses to be around $450 million at the midpoint. This is down slightly sequentially and does include some onetime items, so you will not see the usual lift going into Q2. We expect op margins in the first quarter to be approximately 41% and we expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $56 million and our tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%. This tax rate is slightly higher than our previous outlook due to new IRS guidance released in September. Based on these inputs, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.28 plus or minus $0.07. Before moving on to the Q&A session, I want to inform you that this will be the last quarter we're going to be providing gross margin and OpEx guidance. This will be the only change as we will continue to provide the other items for outlook, including operating margin. This does not change our long-term operating model that we discussed at our Analyst Day of 70% plus gross margins and op margins in the range of 39% to 45%. We are making this transition as it aligns to the way we manage the business; that is, we focus on driving profitable growth and operating margin expansion. So all in, it was a terrific quarter to cap off a very successful year for ADI. And while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism that we enter 2019 equally excited about the opportunities ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Mike to lead our Q&A session. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Before we move to Q&A, I want to remind everyone of a couple points. First, we are moving to sell-in accounting starting first quarter '19. And second, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter. As such, our commentary around expected growth in the first quarter 2019 will exclude these 2 factors. In short, our growth commentary will be on a 13-week sell-through basis. Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Jennifer, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : The first question is on the industrial business. So obviously, it's very diversified, and I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit on what your customers are seeing there as far as this slowdown? Are they sort of in a wait-and-see based on what the macro political situation is or are they, perhaps, a little bit more optimistic about '19? Just trying to gauge how your industrial base is feeling right now. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Tore. The -- well, I think I've talked with quite a few customers, both domestically here in America and internationally over the last quarter, 1.5 quarters, maybe 2 quarters. In the atmosphere of the kind of the macro uncertainty driven by trade war rhetoric and so on and so forth and the impacts of the tariffs, I'd say, generally speaking, customers are remaining optimistic though there is, obviously, concern which is dampening enthusiasm for laying down CapEx and taking a long-term view to demand. So I would say, at this point in time, what we're seeing though is cancellations are at a kind of a normal rate and lead times, for the most part, are pretty normal. So in the industrial market itself, we're seeing pockets of softness. I would say, in the automation part of our business, it's largely softening in China. And we are seeing strength, for example, in the electronic test and measurement side of our business. Obviously, health care has remained strong for the company. And I think aerospace and defense is also an area of continued growth and some good acceleration there over the last quarter or 2, so I think that provides you some color. And from our point of view, Tore, we've obviously been investing heavily from an R&D and customer engagement standpoint over the past -- really, the past decade. So I think for ADI, we're better positioned than we've ever been in that market. It is our #1 focus, I would say, and it's broad, it's deep, it's got many thousands of products, many thousands of customers associated with it. So we're optimistic about our capacity to continue to grow content and to gain share as we have been doing in '18 and beyond. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Tore. Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Vince, that was very helpful. So I had a clarification question. You mentioned now with the synergies between Linear and ADI, I think you've used the word double. I'm just wondering, does that mean the revenue synergies are now up to $2 billion? Or is it -- if you could just clarify that statement. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think back in '17 when we had our Analyst Day, we were talking, at that point in time, about our visibility and confidence towards $1 billion. So yes, we're well above that now and looking at -- continuing to grow and we've certainly confidence that we've doubled that synergy number over the past year and a bit. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. I'm going to say -- a bit why we're so confident we can double the growth there at Linear as that pipeline expands. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Vince, just on the comm sector, you had mid-20% year-over-year growth. Last quarter, you just put up almost 30% growth. This quarter, you did highlight some of the drivers there. I'm wondering if you could dissect that growth a little bit. I know that you were really positive about the backlog you had at Hittite now that it was under sort of your control from that M&A long product cycle designs. To what extent is Hittite helping to drive this growth? And I guess, are you at all concerned that some of this growth might be pull-ins from China trying to get these parts before the trade war escalates and potentially not being able to get these parts, just given how important massive MIMO and 5G are. Maybe you can help allay some of those concerns and just give us a little bit more detail there. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, John. Good questions. So let me start with the latter part of your question first. I don't get any sense that there's any form of tension or panic buying by our Chinese customers to get ahead of any tariffs or trade war concerns. Remember as well, what we're seeing now is an accelerated build-out of, I would say, enhanced 4G and moving into the early stages of 5G. That's a multiyear process anyway, no matter what. So what I'm seeing is a good balance between what we see as the increasing demand from the carriers and the -- I would say, the supply from our customers to meet the carrier's demands. When you look at the -- put the whole thing together, we're looking at '19 being another year of double-digit growth. We have, as I said, we've got 4G tailwinds and that's driven by content gains we've been making over the last 3 years, I'd say. Hittite incidentally, just to give you a little bit of a benchmark here, when we inquired Hittite, it was roughly a $270 million trailing 12-month revenue company. The Hittite portion of our business is well over $400 million at this point in time. And it isn't just communications, it's where microwave and those radio frequency technologies are used and aerospace and defense and other parts of the instrumentation industrial market. So I think, when you put the massive MIMO addition to 4G or 5G, as some people call it, and the early stages of 5G, that gives ADI a tremendously increased opportunity value over 4G. And as I said in the prepared remarks, my sense is that we've got a 4x content improvement as 5G begins to ramp up here. So it's -- and that, by the way, doesn't include -- we're not including any specific targets for LT in that number, but there's a huge cross-selling opportunity. We're beginning to go to production with power designs at this point in time. So I think, the tailwinds are strong and ADI's content has grown, our portfolio has never been stronger, so that's what we're seeing. I think it's a share gain story for ADI. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, John. Do you have a follow-up? John Pitzer : Yes. Just quickly, guys. I hate to bring it up because it's such a small percentage of the revenue and the growth drivers, but you have historically just given us some color on the consumer segment and how we should be thinking about that, especially given the different launch times of flagship handsets. How do we think about consumer going into the January quarter? Vincent Roche : Well, looking into '19, we started the year off a bit stronger given the content that we have in some of the, say, older platforms. All that said, we're still expecting that consumer will decline somewhere between 10%, 20% on the portable side in '18, while the prosumer part of our business, which looks a lot more like a B2B sector, is continuing to perform well for the company. So I think the way to look at this, John, after this year's growth will be determined by essentially new sockets, either what we win or what we lose. That will determine, ultimately, what happens, I think, after '19. But as always, we're optimistic about where we're playing in consumer and we continue to be selective in the areas that we target and we're always seeking to increase diversity of application and customers, so I think that's the snapshot of consumer at this point. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: John, we're looking for a 7% increase on a sell-through basis for the consolidated company and 12% for B2B, so you should be able to impute the numbers you need for consumer. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Vince, can you just expand on the comment around the confidence in automotive returning to kind of high single digits? And then if you're able to frame it, I know there's some A2B programs that may help in the coming years as well as kind of BMS, but just any additional details would help. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Craig. Well, first and foremost, cabin electronics, that part of our business has done very well during '18 and we're positioned for more growth in '19, so the growth in that area was double digits in '18. And yes, the A2B application space is growing for the company. We've added this new media transport modality as well that we call C2B. And we're also now getting the benefit of adding LTC silent switcher technology into some of these sockets as well, so we're at the early stages of an operant in our power business there. I think as well, it was well publicized during the year that we had some troubles with our Battery Management Solution technology. But I think we've really turned the corner, particularly in the second half of '18. In the second half, we achieved double-digit growth and we expect '19, also, to be a double-digit growth performer for ADI. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we're sampling our next-generation BMS. And we've got some very interesting architectural innovations as well coming on the back of that, that will change the way these systems are designed and implemented in the electrification activity. On the sensing side, again, I've talked about some of this in the prepared remarks across radar. We've got our -- we're sampling our 77-gigahertz image quality radar. We've a very interesting and growing diversified pipeline in the LIDAR sector that combines both LT and ADI mixed-signal technologies. And many customers are starting to use our IMU, inertial management units, in the kind of L3 plus autonomous driving area. So I think we have continued to accelerate during '18 in terms of stabilizing BMS and starting to get it back to a growth trajectory, and a lot of exciting things going on in autonomous VD goals as well. So hopefully, Craig, that frames it up for you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] Operator : Our next question is from CJ Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, more of a cyclical macro question. You talked about seeing some softness in China. Curious if you're seeing softness anywhere else, particularly as you think about strong U.S. dollar and potential impact to emerging market demand. Would love to hear your thoughts cyclically where you might be seeing the other pockets of weakness, if at all? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks for the question, CJ. So yes, from a geographic perspective, I'm going -- what I'm going to talk about here is based on design in revenue, so what's happening in each region from an innovation design standpoint. I'd say, as we've come out of the year, all markets have increased year-over-year. Growth was led by China. And I'd say, looking at the sequential trends geographically, most markets were slightly up or a little down and no big moves one way or another to report there. Industrial was up year-on-year. It was a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. Automotive was up year-on-year, again, a little quarter -- a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. But we believe that was related primarily to macro effects there, SAR, China, this new testing modality that's being adopted in Europe, so -- but we expect it to come back in the first quarter to our target. And communications across-the-board, all the primary geographies in which -- where strong communications are up very, very big on a year-on-year basis and also sequentially. So -- and that broad-based strength was led by China as well as the EU, particularly in the communications area. So -- but, hopefully, that gives you a sense for the atmosphere on the geographic basis. Prashanth, do you want to add anything? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: CJ, I would just add that, remember, we think about our geographic revenue based on where activity is designed. So when we think about, from a market standpoint, I mentioned factory auto -- sorry, factory automation was one that we're seeing some softness. Automated test equipment was the other area we were seeing some softness. But outside that, really, the rest of industrial has been staying in growth mode, so that's what's forming our sort of confidence for the Q1 outlook. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : I was wondering if you guys have noticed any shifting of the supply chain manufacturing out of China into other areas and if that is impacting your own business? Vincent Roche : I don't think there's anything really of note. First off, we're not so impacted by the tariffs, but there are some signs that our customers are trying to work around the cost impact of the tariffs. I think there are some passing on of the cost to end customers, and also a very small amount -- at least from our perspective, I'd say, a very small amount of mitigation by our customers by moving to areas not affected by the tariffs when it comes to manufacturing their products, but I think it's very, very de minimis at this point in time. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Mark, I think we're probably more familiar with our specific production and what we're seeing is customers looking at supply chain changes that allow them to maybe avoid staging products in the U.S. that would then get further assembled and have those go directly to other countries where the assembly happens and thereby, avoiding the tariffs. Operator : Our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Vince, I just want to make sure I understood your comments about the slowdown. It sounds like you're characterizing it as a near-term uncertainty. You did talk about cancellations. Can you just help us understand what the order rates were doing as you were entering the current quarter? And then more importantly, what are the factory loadings going to look like at ADI? And structurally, the company is a lot more profitable than in the past cycles, just help us understand the playbook if we were to go into a deeper downturn? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. I'll take some of those and Vince, you can add some pieces. Vincent Roche : Yes. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So let me take factory utilization. Certainly, we're headed into the holiday season, so our factory utilizations normally unaligned a bit for those that are impacted by Thanksgiving and then again for the Christmas-New Year period. So utilizations are coming down, but not necessarily linked to changes in the demand environment beyond our original planning areas. In terms of booking activities, certainly, our industrial business is seeing book-to-bill below parity and it's been a while since we've seen that. But as I mentioned, that we see most of that being heavily weighted from the 2 segments, factory automation and automated test equipment. Order activity has stabilized from where it was. Now I don't think we have the wherewithal to call the bottom here, but I'm just giving you the facts that we saw -- we certainly saw an improvement in October versus what we saw in September. Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think, Ambrish, another -- a little bit of color. So I would say, for the most part, what we're seeing is really a pause rather than any -- we're not seeing cancellations as such. I think it's a pause. It's a level -- it's the macro uncertainty that's causing customers to be a little cautious. Lead times for the company are really normal, and I would say -- as I've just said, cancellations are just normal. And just to give you a little more depth of color on that, so the legacy ADI is well within the normal range of supply chain metrics. In other words, greater than 90% of our portfolio shipping within the normal 4- to 6-week window that we're planning to report. LTE is a little more mixed. We've had some, I would say, tightening of supply. Demand has been strong and supply has been a little tight, but we've been investing aggressively and putting in place new capacity, in fact, over the last couple of quarters, to support not just today's shortfalls, but also to support the future growth that we're expecting and increasingly optimistic about. So the book-to-bill as just -- as Prashanth said, just a little below parity on the B2B side, driven largely by industrial. So -- but I think the book-to-bill that we've given or that we're seeing is very supportive of the guidance that we put out there. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : A bigger picture question for you, Vince, is I think you said that the guidance would imply the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in your B2B business. A very impressive track record, for sure. That's -- as I go back in my model, that's the longest stretch of double-digit growth I can find at any point in time. So I guess, 2 points on that. How much of that do you think is company-specific share gains, target investments, et cetera, versus a cyclical uplift? And how do you view the sustainability of the growth rate or even the target growth rate for your B2B segment? Vincent Roche : Yes. There's a lot of very good questions in there, Ross. So I'd say -- I mean, it's very hard to parse out precisely what is market, what is ADI. Clearly, we, as a company, have -- we retooled the entire strategy of the company, 8, 9, 10 years ago to focus very, very heavily on the B2B area. In fact, we're spending today 95% for R&D in the B2B spaces and most of our customer engagement activities as well, of course, are in the B2B areas. So the addition of the added R&D focus on the legacy ADI portfolio in the B2B area, the addition of Hittite and now LTC, where LTC was largely focused on B2B, I think positions the company well. We have been taking share, that I'm sure of, and I believe we will continue to gain share. And of course, we were aided by favorable macro trends, I think, generally speaking. PMIs have been positive for the last several quarters and GDP has been strong. So obviously, the environment is strong, but I think ADI is executing in a more focused, more intense way as well in capturing the opportunity. So we believe, again, that B2B will increase within our -- I think a more moderated growth range. We've said that, for the long term, that if we can grow our B2B business, kind of 2x to 3x GDP, we would be content on an ongoing basis. And that's my sense for '19 as well, barring any macro cataclysm that -- that's what we're going to see again in the -- we're going to see that kind of growth rate in the coming year. Operator : And our final question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Vince, just a question on the competitive landscape. You mentioned massive MIMO is the strong area of growth for you. Xilink has also been talking about their RF SoC product. I'm wondering how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up and what's your visibility in design wins on next-gen 4G and then 5G? Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think, first off, there are many, many solution variants out there when -- between the antenna and the bit streams, so to speak. And there's -- we have the strongest portfolio of technologies from -- right from the antenna down into the bit stream area. So as I said earlier, as we move into the 5G, the early stages of 5G here, we're looking at potentially 4x the content availability compared to the classical 4G that we've been part of over the last 5, 7 years. And when we get into the millimeter wave side of things, the -- we have, again, we've got the broadest portfolio. We can architect in a very flexible way to all the various customer needs. So as 5G millimeter wave comes in, we're looking at potential gains of 8, 10 plus in terms of potential content just given the channel count on the radio transceivers which, by the way, is where most of the innovation has taken place in these 5G systems, at least, until they virtualize in the early '20s or so. So there's -- there are kind of 3 or 4 major building blocks in these base stations these days. There's the classical transceiver, there's the massive MIMO addition, there's all this power technology that we can bring to bear now as well for our customers. And then there's the digital baseband, the digital front-end. And we're innovating not just in the analog space, but we're also pushing the boundaries incidentally on the digital side. And those boundaries, they blur, they shift, they ebb and they flow over multiple generations. But in our software-defined transceivers, for example, we've taken a significant amount of digital content and combined it with our converter technologies and our radio interface capabilities and dramatically reduce the footprint of the radio and cut the power levels down as well. So those are all important answers to very, very critical problems that our customers have. So my sense is, over the next, say, 5 years until we get into millimeter wave, we're looking at a potential content increase of 3x to 4x, and then it's a question of how many radios deploy. And -- but we're very, very well positioned from the content and architectural coverage standpoint. Michael Lucarelli : Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found at the quarterly results section of our website. We look forward to seeing you this quarter at Credit Suisse conference and the BMO conference in the coming weeks, and thanks for joining us. Have a great Thanksgiving.

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.  Now onto the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comment today about ADI's first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which include -- excludes special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from these prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.  As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter. In addition, this is the first quarter of our adoption of ASC 606 or sell-in accounting. We have restated our historical financial statements to conform to this standard, and posted a 2-year quarterly end-market look-back for revenue on our investor site. All comments during today's call on revenue growth and our commentary during Q&A will exclude this extra week and be on a sell-in basis, unless otherwise stated. In addition, as we move to sell-in accounting and further refine LTC's product mapping in the channel, we have adjusted approximately $80 million of annual revenue from communications to consumer. The new mapping does not impact industrial or automotive revenue.  Okay. With that, I'll turn over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and a very good morning to everybody. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 was another very successful quarter for ADI. In what is a challenging macroeconomic environment, we're executing soundly and delivering strong results. Revenue of $1.54 billion in the first quarter came in at the high-end of our guidance, led by our strong year-over-year growth in our B2B markets. This growth was driven predominantly by continued strength in our communications market related to ongoing 4G upgrades and initial 5G deployments. Adjusted operating margins of over 41% were above the midpoint of guidance, as we balanced our strategic investments with prudent discretionary spend. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.33, also at the high-end of guidance.  Over the past 12 months, we have generated over $2.1 billion in free cash flow or 35% of revenue, which places ADI in the top 5% of the S&P 500. And over that same time period, we've returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments.  Now while macro uncertainties continue to exist, our strong execution and results enable us to continue to invest in extending over franchise in strategic areas where we see attractive opportunities for future growth. To that end, we're investing record levels of R&D to push the boundaries of innovation and expand the breadth and depth of our franchise. In addition, we've increased our investments in our go-to-market activities to further broaden and deepen our customer reach and our engagements.  The strength and resiliency of our business model allows us to innovate regardless of business conditions. This ability is imperative given the long life cycles in our markets, where average product life span is a decade or indeed more. And while some competitors pull back and lose momentum in uncertain times, we plan to continuously invest to build upon our virtuous cycle of innovation-led growth.  In my 30-plus year career with ADI, I've never been more confident or excited about our prospects than I am today. The third wave of information and communications technology is creating an inflection in the analog industry. And we've built a product portfolio aimed at favorable macro trends that I believe will provide tailwinds for years to come.  Now I'll provide you with some examples of what we're seeing in our B2B market specifically.  Today, industrial customers are balancing CapEx deployments with tariff uncertainty. However, our customers remain focused on digitizing the factory and securing the efficiency and productivity that will fuel their future growth. The move to the digital factory requires more high-performance signal processing and power management, additional sensors and more robust connectivity. These are all areas where ADI excels.  On the automotive front, vehicle unit growth has stalled recently. But the real growth drivers, electric and autonomous vehicles, are in the nascent stages. Electric vehicles represent only 1% of worldwide sales, but industry reports suggest this will climb to more than 15% over the next decade or so. The powertrain in an electric vehicle opens the opportunity for us to address up to 3x the content compared to combustion engines.  Today, we enjoy the luxuries of Level 2 autonomous vehicles, but the cars of the future will require higher precision and up to 4x more sensors per car to provide the necessary level of safety for a fully autonomous vehicle. And it's not just about radar or cameras. We expect that these cars of the future will require LIDARs and IMUs as well. ADI is uniquely positioned to provide the necessary building blocks across all these sensing modalities as well as the analog and mixed single processing, RF and microwave connectivity, algorithms and power management to make the autonomous vision a reality. In communications, carriers are looking to upgrade both the wireless networks and the optical backbone to deal with the ever increasing deluge of data being created and transmitted. This additional data intensifies the need for spectral, space, thermal and cost efficiency. And with our comprehensive portfolio of software-defined mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies, we're creating very compelling solutions for our customers as they upgrade 4G networks and begin the introduction of 5G systems.  An important bridge between 4G and 5G is the introduction of massive MIMO radio systems. And ADI's software-defined transceiver technology is at their core. These upgrades to massive MIMO systems are just beginning today. And the increase in radio count expands our content opportunity by up to 4x when compared to traditional 4G systems.  This phase will be followed by network expansions to higher frequencies to increase bandwidth as well as the upgrade of the optical backhaul and virtualization of the network to more efficiently move the data. This next wave will once again create the opportunity for ADI to address additional content, both in the radio as well as in the optical network.  We see these upgrades towards 5G as a multi-year cycle that's just beginning, and are expected to provide tailwinds to our business well into the future. And lastly, in health care, the dual impact of an aging global population and the pressing need to more economically and effectively manage wellness is driving continued investments in our products by our customers. Here we're complementing our high-end component franchise with highly integrated subsystems, thereby extending our addressable market to capture new levels of value. For example, in digital x-ray, we're creating highly integrated photons to bit subsystems that enable our customers to deliver high fidelity images at lower radiation dosages. Separately, ADI's deep expertise in vital signs monitoring and ultra-low power electronics enable clinical-grade performance under battery power, allowing us to deliver high accuracy, portable monitoring at virtually any point of use.  Now in closing, as the saying goes, a rising tide lifts all ships, the true test of a company's strategy, execution and value is its performance during a low tide. Now we've chosen a strategy that focuses on innovation, diversity across technologies, markets and applications and continuous improvement across every aspect of our performance. And the results speak for themselves. We're confident that our ethos and heritage of innovation, leadership in high-performance analog, deep relationships with our customers and alignment to favorable macro trends positions us to create to continue to outperform, capture more value, expand our addressable market and deliver strong results for our shareholders.  And so with that, I will hand it over to Prashanth, who will bring you through more detail. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call.  My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, and we have now adopted ASC 606 or sell-in accounting. We have restated our historical financial statements to conform. And as Mike mentioned, we've also posted a 2-year quarterly end-market look-back for revenue on a sell-in basis. To normalize our growth rates and give you a like-for-like comparison, my prepared remarks and our Q&A commentary will exclude this extra week and will be on a sell-in basis, unless otherwise stated.  Now onto the quarter. In the face of geopolitical uncertainty, we are pleased to report strong first quarter results with revenue, operating margin and EPS all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, we are delighted to have increased our dividend by almost 13%, the largest increase since 2013. And we also raised our dividend growth target to 7% to 15% annually. This reflects our strong financial results as well as our optimism regarding ADI's future.  Before diving into the income statement, let me first cover the end markets. Our first quarter B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year, led by exceptional growth in the communication market, driven by ongoing momentum in 4G and the initial 5G deployments. The industrial market represented 47% of sales in the quarter and revenue was roughly flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Within this highly diversified business, revenue growth in health care, electronic test and measurement, aerospace and defense were balanced by weaker demand in factory automation and memory test. The comms market represented 22% of sales during the quarter and experienced very strong double-digit year-over-year growth, led by strength in wireless. This growth exceeded our expectations and illustrates the strong momentum ADI is experiencing in traditional 4G systems and in the early deployments of 5G massive MIMO. We see 5G as a multi-year upgrade cycle that is expected to deliver continued growth over the coming years.  Our auto business represented 17% of sales in the quarter, and based on sell-through revenue, was essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Overall vehicle unit weakness was offset by double-digit growth in BMS, growth in power management as we bring new products to market and extend our customer reach and ramping sales of A2B. The 6% year-over-year reported growth from our end-market breakout is primarily due to sell-in accounting as we moved some customers from direct to distribution during the quarter.  And lastly, our consumer business represented 14% of sales in the first quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year. However, portables declined less than expected.  Now onto the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high-end of our guidance at approximately $1.54 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 70.3% and lower year-over-year due to end-market mix and lower utilization rates. OpEx in the quarter was $448 million, down slightly sequentially and below the midpoint of guidance, as we balanced our strategic investments with prudent discretionary spend. This translated to an operating margin of 41.2%, which was at the high-end of our guided range. Non-op expenses in the first quarter were $56 million, unchanged from 4Q, but lower than a year ago, due to our debt reduction of $1.2 billion over the past year. Our tax rate for the quarter was just above 14% and at the lower end of outlook of 14% to 16%. All told, adjusted diluted earnings per share from the first quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance at $1.33.  Now moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory dollars increased slightly sequentially, while days were flat at 117 compared to fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the coming quarters, we will begin to build bridge inventory ahead of the closure of our front-end and back-end facilities that we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost synergies. So we plan to modestly increase our inventory days temporarily until these closures are complete.  Distribution inventory days were down, both sequentially and year-over-year and remain in our target range. CapEx in the first quarter was $91 million or 6% of sales. For the full year, we anticipate CapEx may run modestly higher than our 4% model due to the co-location of our product and business development teams and additional capacity to support future linear growth. This would be a temporary deviation from our long-term model. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Over the past 12 months, we have returned 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments.  In the first quarter, we repaid $100 million of debt, paid $178 million in dividends and repurchased $227 million of our stock or roughly 2.5 million shares.  Now onto guidance, which again with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses is also on an adjusted basis, excluding items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, our guidance is based on sell-in or POA accounting. For context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past 3 years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by about 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger.  Second quarter revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications in the aggregate to increase slightly year-over-year, led by the communications market. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect second quarter operating margin to be up slightly sequentially at 41.3%. Non-op expenses are expected to be basically flat sequentially, and we are planning for our tax rate to be towards the lower end of our previously guided range of 14% to 16%. Based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.07. All in, it was a strong quarter to kick off fiscal '19. And while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism and say that we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.  And with that, I'll turn over to Mike to start our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Before we move to Q&A, one last reminder from IR. Our growth commentary will be on a normalized 13-week basis and on sell-in, unless we otherwise state it. Now let's get to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we have our first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I just wanted to put your guide with respect to what the peers have reported and guided to. Is it fair to assume that it's really, the sell-in accounting change is one of the bigger factors in your Q-over-Q guide being different than your peers like [ Dixon ] and Maxim. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: No, Ambrish, I'm not sure why you'd conclude that. Our guide -- we're not -- as I mentioned, we're not guiding point-of-sale anymore. We're on a sell-in basis. But the guide is at the $1,541 million midpoint of growth -- excuse me, at the $1,500 million midpoint. The guide should be on a year-over-year basis. If you were to take an assumption on flat inventory channel, you would still see a pretty strong sequential or year-over-year growth number there. Michael Lucarelli : Ambrish, just some context there. As Prashanth said in his prepared remarks, we built inventory in the first half of the year and -- in '18 and this year, we're not planning to build as much. So that would actually be counter to what you said. Vincent Roche : Ambrish, if you take our outlook for the next quarter, 2Q, basically, our days in the channel are flat. So it's certainly not an inventory build or sell-in issue. We run the company on a sell-through basis. So I want to make that clear. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : I did. I just wanted to make sure I got that right. A bit longer-term, Vince, on the 5G versus 4G. Can you just help us understand what are the different dynamics architecture wise? And also the content gains that you expect? I know it's multi-flavor rollout, multi-year rollout, but how should we think about your positioning versus what it was in 4G? Vincent Roche : Yes. So the 4G build-outs are continuing. I think that will be the story for the next couple of years in terms of revenue contribution to ADI. But of course, 4G is being upgraded. We're adding massive MIMO, for example, to direct the energy and improve spectral efficiency. So I think we have a very high share at the present time in 4G and in the initial stages of 5G. And what we're seeing right now is, as I said, the 4G phase continues. I think there are multiple years left where 4G will be the primary platform. But we're in the initial stages of 5G deployments. But really 5G has yet to materialize. When it comes to looking at the content, I would say, these new generations of 4G create 4x more content value for ADI. And of course, when we move to 5G with the higher-frequency systems, the microwave systems and the densification of these massive MIMO systems, there is another bump that we expect to get in content there. So -- and that's, by the way, before we add in the power management portfolio as well. So as I've said before, for every $1 of analog content, of mixed-signal content, there's at least $1 of power. And I'm pleased to say that we are at the early stages of attaching our LT power management portfolio to our 4G and 5G story as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus. Tore Svanberg : First question, I'm intrigued by the investments you're doing in health care. I assume that up until now, that's mainly  sort of a B2B business. But there seems to be a lot of things going on in the consumer side. So should we expect ADI to participate both in B2B and in consumer when it comes to health care? Vincent Roche : It's a good question. Well, most of what we're doing is, for example in the more point-of-use, the clinical grid vital signs monitoring, we are focusing very much on the higher end of the sensing and signal processing activity there. So we're not -- true to form with ADI, we are focused on really solving the toughest problems and enabling consumers to wear new health care sensing technologies to predict and help monitor wellness and indeed recovery from health situations. So I would say that the way to think about this story is that we're going to be focused largely on more B2B type activities. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Tore? Tore Svanberg : That's very helpful. Yes. Question for Prashanth. Prashanth, you said, as you go through the manufacturing transition, your inventories are going to go up. Can you give us a sense for how much we're talking about here? Maybe you could give us a range on inventory day? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Tore. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had committed to some additional cost synergies relating to the shutdown of 2 sites that we acquired as part of the LTC acquisition. And these shutdowns should generate an incremental $100 million of cost synergies, all of which is in cost of goods. To help us through that transition, we're going to be needing to put a little bit more inventory internally on to our balance sheets. And hard to kind of pinpoint too much at this early stage, but we're estimating around 5 days is what would be necessary to kind of carry us through the -- bridging the closure of those 2 facilities. And then once those facilities are up and running, we'll burn that off. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Back to the sell-in accounting. So if I compare the new revenue profile with the old one, I note a considerable amount of revenue, particularly from industrial that moved from the second half of '18 to the first half. As you said, you built in the first and sold off in the second, and it shows up in the change. But it was a lot of revenue. Was the magnitude of this draw down bigger than what you would typically see in your ordinary patterns, just maybe given the stronger demand environment we had in the first half. I guess, maybe, just to put in other words, like, is the magnitude of the draw down in the channel that we saw in the second half bigger than what we would see? And is the channel right now leaner than when it ordinarily be in a normal second half? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Stacy. Let me break that into 2 pieces. So first, if you think back to last year, it was around summer that we were one of the first companies to indicate that we were beginning to see some challenge in the factory automation space, given what was going on, particularly with China. So being proactive on that, we began to constrain the amount of inventory going into the channel in preparation of the uncertain times ahead. So yes, last year, we did see a more significant kind of correction to inventory in the channel in the second half given the macro environment. As we -- so now setting that up for this year, now that we are on sell-in accounting, that creates for some tough comps in the first half. And again, as we move into the second half now, we'll also be lapping the softer business environment as well as the inventory channel correction. So we do feel pretty good that the growth kind of gets better for industrial from here on forward. And in terms of what's in the channel, today, we're at about 7.5 weeks, and that's kind of right in the range that we guide to. As Vince mentioned, and this is important, we focused running the business on a POS basis. So the inventory in the channel for us is striking that balance in what is necessary to serve our customers, and it's less about kind of managing a particular revenue number. It is -- POS is what drives our decisions on what we put in the channel. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Stacy. Do you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : I do. I wanted to ask about OpEx. So you were kind of flattish year-over-year in Q1. You're guiding kind of flattish in Q2. But at the same time, you're talking about continually investing in new opportunities. So I guess, in particular, giving the current situation which does seem somewhat uncertain, how should we be thinking about OpEx growth maybe relative to revenue growth as we go through the rest of the year? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. I would say that, if you think historically, there has been a sort of a meaningful change in OpEx when we move from first quarter to second quarter. We told you in the last earnings call that, that would not be the case this year, that our first quarter would be a little bit higher but that -- and there were some one-timers that we talked about in the last call, but we're behind that. And as we move through the balance of the year, we're expecting OpEx to be relatively flattish. The biggest driver on frankly will continue to be variable compensation, which is designed to adjust the spend in line with the profit and the revenue growth. R&D today runs at about 18% of revenue, and we really consider that fully funded. So we will work within that envelope to deliver the product development needs that are required. Operator : Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar, Piper Jaffray. Harsh Kumar : Gross margin came down, I assume that was just mix with sort of B2B sort of hurting a little bit and consumer coming in stronger. How are you expecting to manage the factory or the fab, and therefore, the utilization and gross margin in the coming few quarters? Vincent Roche : Well, first quarter, we had lower utilization. But we expect that utilization will increase in the second quarter and through the rest of our fiscal year here. So we'll, I think, keep pretty high level of utilization. And also, the 70.3% margins that we posted in the first quarter, as the mix towards industrial improves, we would expect also the gross margin to improve. So I think, utilization is in good shape across the company, and I think as well we are probably seeing what would be the lower point of the gross margin activity right now, and that will certainly improve as the industrial business improves. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Harsh, your comments are correct. Just one clarification there. It was growth in consumer, but it was also the growth in communications. So both of them were responsible for the end-market mix. And do remember that we are left -- this was the current quarter where we have the typical holiday shutdown. So utilizations do -- are at the lowest point typically over the holiday season. So with that, we'll go to our next caller. Vincent Roche : You can have a follow-up, Harsh? Harsh Kumar : Yes. So quick question on the automotive. So I got excited looking at your automotive number before realizing that there's a lot of sell-in stuff going on. Could you give us some color on how it held up if you back out the sell-in? And if you are unwilling to do that, maybe talk about, you had sort of laid out some targets on when you start to see some real growth, mid- to high-single digit kind of numbers in automotive a year or even slightly more than that out. How do you feel about that number -- that time frame? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Great. Great, Harsh. Thank you. I'm going to do the first part and let Vince take the second part. So as I said in the prepared remarks, we moved some customers who were direct into the channel. So as a result, there was a little bit build in inventory associated with that. Normally that would not be revenue for us, remember that. And the growth, if you want to think about what does the auto growth do to sell-in, that would have been a flat number. So auto growth in the quarter, as we think about it, natural demand was flattish. And we would say that the -- for the first half, we kind of expect that to be flattish because the second quarter is going to have the corresponding offset from what we -- from the inventory build that we had in the first quarter. Channel inventory overall was kind of minimal quarter-over-quarter. So auto was up, but the other markets were down. With that let me -- let Vince talk to kind of longer-term auto growth. Vincent Roche : Yes. So we're expecting to the -- through 2018, the ADI specific, the legacy ADI portion of our business grew in the high-single digits. The LT portion was in the lower single digits. But let me tell you a couple of things that we've been driving hard in our business. Or BMS, the battery management solutions, that were legacy LTC, we've been growing that in double digits over the past 3 quarters or so. And we're looking at the remainder of this year, the full 2019 as a double-digit growth year in that particular area. And in fact, I think Prashanth indicated in his CapEx remarks that one of the reasons we're increasing CapEx is to enable us to put the equipment in place to get our products to market faster in that particular area and to put the test coverage that we need as well in our back-end. I'm glad to say as well that we're winning incremental power sockets in the automotive sector. We're bringing power to new customers. And we've seen just in this last quarter, in fact our power portfolio grew in the automotive sector on a year-over-year basis. Legacy ADI, our infotainment business, continues to flourish, and we're winning many premium audio sockets. And also attaching LT power again to everything that we do in the automotive area. So we've just launched as well some very exciting high-resolution radar technology at the 77-gigahertz level, so that's yet to come. But all the early indications are that we're starting to get traction there. So I think we've many technologies and product areas that are well aligned with the critical themes in automotive around autonomy and electrification. And we now have the best portfolio in the industry to attack these opportunities. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : The commentary on B2B, up slightly, can you frame that, if you look it between comm, industrial and automotive, just kind of a rough sense of how you expect those markets to trend year-over-year? Michael Lucarelli : Sure. Craig, comm will lead that growth, I would say. Industrial will be down year-over-year. Remember, last 2Q was a very, very strong quarter. I think we grew double digits sequentially in 2Q. That was kind of our peak industrial revenue a year ago. It was a tough comp, plus we also talked about the inventory change in the channel year-over-year. Automotive is going to be down year-over-year, as we talked about the sell-in versus sell-through accounting. So for auto, I would think, look at basically first half '19 flattish versus first half '18. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And that is flattish auto with unit -- with vehicle unit sales down. So we do recognize that, that is a good accomplishment given the decline in vehicle production. Michael Lucarelli : So then comms will be another strong double-digit grower year-over-year. Pull that together, increases slightly sequentially. And that's even with, I'll call, the offset of auto being a bit weaker because of the sell-in accounting. If you took that away, B2B is up probably 2%, 3% year-on-year. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. Appreciate the color there. And then, Vince, just a question. Understanding there's some near-term cyclical pressure on the industrial market, can you talk through just design engagements with customers and things that once you see some of the cyclical pressure ease, how that business could get kind of back on track? Vincent Roche : It's a good question, Craig. We have an opportunity pipeline now both on legacy ADI and LT legacy power products, in particular, that is at an all-time record high. So we're basically converting that pipeline across-the-board, and we've a broader and deeper position in the automation sector. We've extended our reach into electronic test and measurement, which complements our more vertically oriented memory test area quite well. And the energy sector as well is doing well for the company and on a year-over-year basis has been growing. So -- all the things we do around sensing, measuring, interpreting, powering and connecting, those technologies are getting used in more and more places in the industrial sector and in the aerospace and defense as well. So we have a bigger portfolio. We've got more sales and application resource out there, deeply engaging with our customers every day. So my sense is, if I were to put a target growth number on it, I think we have the opportunity to grow consistently in the mid- to high-single digit area over the coming 5, 7 years. Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis, Barclays. Thomas O'Malley: This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. Just want to cover something you guys mentioned early in the call. I think you said that you moved $80 million from comm to consumer. Could you describe what you're moving over and kind of the growth profile of that chunk of revenue? Michael Lucarelli : Tom, this mainly relates to prosumer business. So think of like Polycoms and that type of stuff for conference calls, that -- those type of things we moved from comms. The legacy for Linear were in communications, we put those into consumer where ADI puts them, as prosumer typically is a GDP-plus business growth wise. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: It was customer mapping as we continue to finish the integration process with LTC. Vincent Roche : Yes. So it's basically the nonportable stuff, and it looks and feels like a B2B business. Lots of customers and products and longer product life cycles when compared to the portable area. So that's the change that's taking place. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up? Thomas O'Malley: Yes. I guess, just moving on more towards the comm side. You guys were talking about how 4G is really still strong and you guys are seeing the 4x content increase for massive MIMO ahead of what people are really excited about in 5G. Can you kind of talk about the timing of that? And how much legs, you think, are left of that before that 5G transition should that happen in the next couple of quarters? Vincent Roche : Well, different people have different definitions of what constitutes 4G and 5G. I would say anything that is 4G with a massive MIMO connected to it is 4.5G, some people call that 5G. So that's already in play, and that's one of the strongest growth drivers in our portfolio. And I think that will be the story for, at least, another 12 to 18 months. I think it's going to be the very advanced 4G technologies that are beginning to utilize that bridge technology to 5G, which is massive MIMO. I see true massive -- true 5G being a 2021, '22 introduction point. So I think -- you will see trials, of course, in the meantime of the classical microwave-driven 5G, but I think that's still a couple of years out. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein, SunTrust. William Stein : First, I'd like you to remind us about the capital allocation strategy for the company. There was a dividend increase. Also taking a step back, you're now below 2 turns of net leverage. There was for a time a concern around leverage that's clearly behind us now. But the last 2 acquisitions you did, Hittite and Linear, I think, are proving very successful. And in the context of the broader capital allocation strategy, I'm hoping you might comment on your appetite for M&A, which has been, maybe gotten a little bit out of style in the last year or so, but I would suspect should still be on the top of ADI's mind given the success you've had? Vincent Roche : Well, the first call on our capital is to make sure that we invest to the fullest extent in building the greatest products and getting these products to market. So that's the first call. And we're investing, in fact our OpEx is at a record level this year, our fixed OpEx. And so that's the first call on capital. We have committed to returning all our free cash flow after debt repayment to our shareholders. We -- that's the track we're on. We are very happy with where we are right now as a company with the combination of ADI legacy, Hittite and LT. So we're still integrating LT and creating the leverage that we know we can create with that franchise. So that's where we are right now. And we've been doing some tuck-in acquisitions over the last 12 months, we'll continue to do that, but I think, that's the way to think about it right now. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Will? William Stein : Yes. I'm wondering if you can comment on the degree to which you believe the trade conflict has been hurting your business. I think it's clear, there has been some effect, maybe not as much as others because, in particular, the comp strength, but to what degree you see that already embedded in orders? And what you think sort of the future holds if there is a trade agreement in regards to your backlog and your trend of business? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Let me start and then let Vince add some more color. I just want to get to your question on orders. So -- I know that's probably on many people's minds. January orders were stronger than December. Now that's not unusual for us, but it is a good sign, and that was strength in orders across all of our B2B markets. Now February has Chinese New Year, so there's a lot of noise in that. But going into the Chinese New Year, orders remain strong. And while it is a noisy metric, and we do -- but we do look at it, our 4-week book-to-bill is higher than both our 8-week and our 13-week. But I do want to emphasize that is a very noisy metric, but for whatever that's worth. Vincent Roche : I think that's fine, Prashanth. Operator : And our next question comes from John Pitzer, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Both of mine are relative to the comms business. I guess, Vince, when I adjust for the extra week and the change in accounting, the comms business was up north of 40% year-over-year in the January quarter, just excellent results. But as you start to kind of lap the law of large numbers and hard compares, what do you think the sustainable growth rate in the comms business should be over a longer period of time? I guess, if you look at the last several quarters, you've grown revenue on a quarterly basis by almost $100 million. I'm wondering if you could help us break down the buckets of that growth between sort of massive MIMO, 5G, Hittite? And maybe to follow on to Will's question. There is some concern out there that perhaps you're seeing a pull-in from some of your Chinese customers relative to concerns about their ability to get parts or tariffs. Are you seeing any sort of pull-ins in these numbers or not? Vincent Roche : Well, I think, there probably is some. And I don't see anything unnatural in the numbers incidentally. But there is obviously some pull-in. There is anxiety around the current trade tension situation. But also remember, there are  -- particularly in China, there are planned releases of advanced 4G systems and the trialing of 5G systems, so that's taking place. I think our story is dominated primarily by the fact that we have much more content than we've ever had historically in these systems of ever increasing complexity. It's -- off the top of my head, John, it's hard to give you a breakdown of what the individual pieces are in terms of the contribution from legacy ADI, Linear and Hittite. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and certainly in the Q&A here, we're beginning to see the early stages of LTC power being adopted. So the portfolio today is largely dominated by legacy ADI mixed signal. We're at the early stage of adoption of LT. And Hittite is a tremendous source of strength in the higher frequency -- connect the  -- products that connect to the antenna. And all that said, my expectation is with the content and with the expectations of our customers, that, that business will grow at double-digits for the next several years. John Pitzer : And then Vince... Michael Lucarelli : Thanks John, in the interest of time we'll -- go ahead, John. John Pitzer : You got me started. We can take it off-line. Well, I was just going to say on the 4x content story, what percentage of your comms revenue does that content story cover? Or are you really kind of guiding that at some point in the future we can go back and look at a quarterly revenue run rate that's kind of 4x what it was maybe 2 or 3 years ago? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So at a high level, John, 2018 was really about share gains on traditional 4G. Doesn't really include that 4x content. That 4x content comment relates to, as you move to more radios and massive MIMO, the radios go up by 8x, the content opportunity for us up at 4x, and we're adding Linear power on to that. So that's really in the future. So at a high level, '18 is about 4G share gains, '19 and beyond will be about moving to massive MIMO and the 4x content. Operator : Your last question comes from C.J. Muse, Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess to follow-up on a handful of the previous questions. Your industrial business definitely proved more resilient than I think most of us were thinking coming in. And so just curious, how much of that do you think was a result of moving to sell-in versus your particular portfolio? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I would say, none of that was really due to sell-in. Remember that industrial business largely goes through the channel. We have a very tough compare in the first half because in 2018, we built inventory in the channel, so that is primarily the industrial business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw growth in aerospace, defense, electronic test and measurement, which more than helped to offset the headwind we had in automation and memory test, which we've signaled some time ago. The book-to-bill is above parity. So a little bit lower than normal, but that's already reflected in our outlook. I mentioned orders have gotten better. So I think, Vince made the comment, we think we continue to grow from here. Christopher Muse : That's helpful. And I guess, as a quick follow up, I guess, more limited commentary on the consumer side, as I figured, would start there. How are you thinking about seasonality? And kind of given what you know today design-win-wise, what that business can look like through calendar '19? Michael Lucarelli : Yes, I mean, 2Q is usually the low point of the year for that business, just given the demand there. And if you think about it, on last call, Vince highlighted that we think consumer will be down 10% to 20% in fiscal '19, and that's kind of what we're sticking to for outlook.  And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found at the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.  Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today about ADI's second quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks very much, Mike, and a very good morning to everybody on the call. Now before I get into my recap of the quarter, I wanted to briefly touch on recent developments. As you're no doubt aware, the U.S. government announced last week that it's restricting a large communications company from acquiring U.S. products and technology. While this will have at least a short-term impact on our communications business, our business is global, broad and robust and we'll manage through this. Prashanth will give a bit more insight into the anticipated financial impact of this development during his particular section. So now on to our highlights. The second quarter of fiscal '19 was another successful quarter for ADI with revenue from our B2B markets increasing year-over-year once again. This represents the 12th consecutive quarter of annual B2B revenue growth, which is really a testament to the diversity of our franchise and our ability to innovate ahead of secular growth opportunities. Revenue of $1.53 billion came in at the high end of our guidance, led by strong year-over-year growth from our communications applications across multiple segments. Adjusted gross and operating margins increased compared to last quarter to 70.6% and 41.5%, respectively. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.36, which was also at the high end of outlook. Now over the past 12 months, we've generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow or 34% of revenue. And during that time period, we've returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments. Now before we move on to the financial section of our call, I'd like to continue our discussion around ADI's key markets, their trends and ADI's strategic initiatives, positioning us to capitalize on these opportunities. We previously discussed our strong position in the wireless market, particularly in massive MIMO and 5G, where our content opportunity is up to 4x compared to traditional 4G systems. So today, I'm going to talk about the other 1/3 of our comms business, namely the wireline market. The wireline market is very profitable. It's a steady growth business for ADI with a combined company having grown at a high single-digit rate annually for the past 5 years. The market and its challenges around precision, control and power are a perfect match for ADI's comprehensive portfolio and domain expertise. There are many applications within the wireline business. But today, I want to focus on the fastest-growing segment, namely the optical market. The primary driver of the wireline market is unsurprisingly exponential growth in demand for digital data. IP traffic across carrier networks and data centers is doubling every 2.5 years driven primarily by cloud compute, backhaul of 4G and 5G networks and consumption of data-rich content. This extraordinary growth represents a significant challenge for the carrier networks and data centers that transport and manage this data as it's not possible to lay new optical fiber or double data center floor space every 2 years. So their challenge is ADI's opportunity. The 2 primary ways to solve their data throughput problem are increasing the speed of the existing fiber network and reducing the form factor of data ports to increase data density. Carriers are increasing their speed of their networks by upgrading from 100 gigabits per second to 400 Gps and in some cases, to more than 1 terabit per second. At the same time, optical modules are being scaled down by 2, 4 and even 10x. At this level of data throughput, our customers are pushing the optical components and subsystems, such as lasers, modulators and coherent signal processing, to their physical limits. Precisely controlling throughput, managing synchronization, compensating for signal impairments and reducing system noise is critical to overall system performance. By partnering closely with our customers, we're developing highly optimized optical control and power management products that match the smaller form factor required in next-generation optical systems. Importantly, for every 4x increase in speed in an existing network, our control content opportunity increases by more than 1/3. This 400 gig control port space is the fastest-growing segment of our optical business, largely driven by the rapid growth in data center port traffic. But a high-precision signal chain only solves part of the problem in these next-gen carrier and data center networks. Denser optical networks create power and thermal challenges that our customers must also mitigate to avoid harmful impact on the network's potential speed and data throughput, not to mention impact on their operating expense as power and cooling represent over 30% of a data center's total cost of ownership. That is a huge opportunity for our power portfolio. We're taking our core power franchises, namely \u00b5Module and Silent Switcher technologies, for example, and leveraging ADI's market-leading position to broaden our customer reach and develop optimized solutions for this market. In addition to optical port solutions, we also supply innovative power sequencing and hot swap products. These technologies enable our customers to mitigate costly downtime and avoid disruptions by managing the highly complex power chain of networking servers and routers.  The addressable market for these solutions continues to grow as port and data traffic density continues to increase. Now I've said in the past that for every $1 of signal chain we sell into a system, there's at least $1 of power opportunity. And the wireline market is no different. Since our combination with LTC, we've seen our pipeline in power for the wireless market expand very significantly. So in closing, we expect continued profitable growth over the long term in the wireline market as control and power challenges intensify in response to the market's densification with ever-increasing bandwidth demand. And as providers shift to silicon photonics, we expect even more opportunity for ADI as control and power solutions are necessary to compensate for the lower inherent performance of these silicon-based photonic solutions. And with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Now on to the quarter. In the face of geopolitical uncertainty, we are pleased to report strong second quarter results with revenue, operating margin and EPS all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. As usual, I will cover the end markets before moving to the P&L. Our second quarter B2B revenue increased approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our communications business. The industrial market, which represented 50% of sales in the quarter, performed as expected, decreasing mid-single digits compared to the year ago quarter. Strength in aerospace and defense was outweighed by the anticipated weakness in our automation and memory test businesses. The comms market represented 24% of sales during the quarter and experienced very strong double-digit year-over-year growth, led by ongoing strength in wireless while our wireline franchise also continued to grow nicely. Our results this quarter reflect ADI's higher content and share in 5G. We believe 5G remains in the early stages, and our technology remains a key enabler. And as Vince just highlighted in his section, our wireline business is well positioned to continue to grow profitably in the years ahead. Our auto business represented 16% of sales and was relatively flat compared to the year ago quarter. Strength in BMS, which increased well over 20% year-over-year, and momentum in our power franchise helped to mitigate the overall weakness in vehicle units during the quarter. And lastly, our consumer business represented just 10% of sales in the quarter, the lowest consumer mix since 2016. As expected, this segment decreased on a year-over-year basis. And now moving to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.53 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 70.6%, up 30 basis points sequentially but lower year-over-year primarily due to market mix. And in what is normally a higher OpEx quarter, OpEx decreased sequentially to $443 million. Operating margin of 41.5% came in stronger than our guided midpoint. Non-op expenses in the quarter were $61 million, slightly higher sequentially with the increase primarily related to a onetime expense in the quarter. Interest expense decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Tax rate for the quarter was better than forecasted at approximately 11%. And all told, adjusted diluted earnings per share from the second quarter came in at the high end of guidance at $1.36. Now moving on to the balance sheet. As is normal in the second quarter, inventory dollars and days increased slightly sequentially. And our channel inventory also increased sequentially and year-over-year but still remained comfortably in our target range. CapEx in the second quarter was $75 million or 5% of sales for the full year. We expect CapEx to be temporarily higher and remain at approximately 5%. This additional spend is to support future growth opportunities, especially for our power franchise as well as the colocation of our product and business development teams. Free cash flow was approximately $2.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 6% year-over-year despite the additional CapEx outlay. Over the past 12 months, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. In the second quarter, we repaid $250 million of debt, paid $200 million in dividends and repurchased over $100 million of our stock. Now before moving to guidance, I want to give some context around the additional uncertainty impacting this quarter's outlook. As Vince mentioned, the U.S. government recently announced export restrictions to a large communications company. Our third quarter guidance takes into account the estimated impact on ADI from these restrictions, including no revenue from that customer for the remainder of the quarter. We are currently reviewing our ability to resume shipments under the recently announced temporary general license. And while we do not talk about specific customers, I will say that ADI has an extremely diverse business. The communications market is a bit more concentrated. But still over the trailing 12 months, our largest communication customers only represented mid-single digits or less as a percentage of total ADI sales. So now onto the outlook, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expense, are on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items outlined in today's release. Third quarter revenue is expected to be $1.45 billion, plus or minus $50 million. And at the midpoint, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications in the aggregate to decrease low single digits year-over-year. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect third quarter operating margin to be approximately 40.5%. Non-op expenses are expected to decline sequentially to approximately $56 million. And we are improving our projected tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% for the year. Based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.22, plus or minus $0.07. So overall, it was a very successful first half of the year for ADI, especially when you overlay it with an uncertain economic and political backdrop. I remain very confident that the investments we have made and continue to make will position us for continued outperformance over the long term. Let me hand it back to Mike to start our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Sheryl, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. Tore Svanberg : I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about your core business, excluding communications. So obviously, I know that's a very specific situation. But if you look at especially industrial and auto, are those markets starting to show a path of a recovery? So if you could add some color there, that would be great. Vincent Roche : Yes, sure. Thanks, Tore. Well, let me start with industrial. So I think it's true to say that business has stabilized across the board. We see our customers' inventory levels being very, very normal. And also channel inventory, which is often a proxy for what's going on in the industrial market, is in line also with our targets. I think overall, when the macro turns, I think we see a lot of upside improvement to the business as confidence improves and CapEx is deployed at higher rates. So if I try to unpack it a little bit for you, so in terms of the second quarter, it performed pretty much as we expected. And particularly, we were pleased with the results that we achieved in the aerospace and defense area, where the combination of the Hittite and ADI signal processing solutions are really coming to the fore there, where we're taking share as a company and we see that as a good steady growth driver for many, many years to come. Geographically, I think it's true to say where a lot of our industrial business is centered at Europe and America, we're up year-on-year, fairly stable. And the areas of weakness we saw were largely in Asia, all the various major regions of Asia. So looking out a little bit here, we're seeing stabilization. And I think we will see some -- we'll see some annual growth in the third quarter here as well. So I think that's kind of the shape of the industrial business. If I just talk about the automotive sector for a little bit here. So our performance on revenue was much better than units, than SAAR. And we did see a very modest build in channel. As you know, we're on POA accounting these days when we report to The Street. And we did see a little bit of growth there. But the performance was driven by our growing position in battery management systems for electric vehicles. I think also I'm very pleased to say that our power business is improving across the board. We did better in power than SAAR, for example. So when we look at our performance, power did better than the unit growth in terms of vehicles sold. And also our A2B solutions in the infotainment sector continue to ramp gradually here. So I think if you look at more SAAR-exposed applications, steady-state applications, infotainment, for example, they were down high single digits. And that represented about 2/3 of the overall business. I think the portfolio is very balanced. We've got many new things coming onboard that help us to outgrow any particular weaknesses in SAAR. Michael Lucarelli : Tore, I'll hit one point. You asked about kind of stabilization. We're already seeing stabilization in the industrial market. I think what we're excited about is it's kind of a better decline year-over-year we expect in the third quarter versus our second quarter results. So we declined about 6% in the second quarter. We think it gets better in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Do you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes. As a follow-up, if we look at the communication customer that we're talking about here, how long would it take for a company like ADI to maybe requalify some of that business with all their potential customers? Vincent Roche : Well, I think we're in a very, I would say, great situation here, Tore. We're very well covered as a company across all the various major OEMs with good penetration, in fact, historically high penetration across all the various OEMs. So I think I should start up the conversation by saying that generally speaking, 5G is a transcendental technology that has yet really to begin. I think we're seeing trials in Japan and Korea at this point in time but has really yet to begin in earnest in any volume. And that's probably going to come in the 2020 time frame. So no matter what happens in terms of puts and takes, carrier and OEM relationships, I think the company is well positioned. And specific to China, I guess it's a question of when deployments happen rather than if they happen. And we still have to navigate a lot of uncertainty here in terms of the trade ban. So we're going to know a lot more, I think, over the next 2, 3 months. But as I said, I think it's a case of when deployments happen globally rather than if. And we're in a good position in terms of the dollar content we've got in the various OEMs and our position across all the OEMs at this point in time. Operator : Our next caller comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Vivek Arya : And good job on maintaining the profitability despite all these macro and the Huawei headwinds. Vince, it's interesting that your comments on industrial sound somewhat more optimistic than some of your peers who have -- are looking at all this tariff situation and they are sounding somewhat more downbeat. Is it some company-specific product cycles? How are you sounding a little more optimistic than what we are hearing from some of your peers? Vincent Roche : Yes. It's a good question, Vivek. We, as a company, I think have been more focused than our peers in terms of R&D deployment and customer engagements over the last decade. And I think we are, generally speaking across the board, both at large, say, automation customers, tests and lab equipment-type companies and aerospace and defense, which I've talked a little bit about just a little earlier on, I think we are in a better share position now than we've ever been. It's a big, big part of who we are as a company. So there's tremendous engagement and focus and with many, many tens of thousands of customers. So I think bringing LTC into the fold as well, we increased the strength of our franchise in terms of signal processing but also the power side of things with LT. So I think it's the combination of all those things that has positioned us. It's largely intrinsic or endogenous things we've done over the last decade position us to take share here. So I think it's the strength of our franchise, strength of our customer relationships and the combination with LTC at this point. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Vivek? Vivek Arya : Yes. So for the follow-up, I just wanted to make sure we are kind of all level set on what this ban to Huawei actually means, right.  So let's assume that, that ban stays in place. Hopefully, it gets resolved. But for just the purpose of kind of recordkeeping, there is no more Huawei -- your July quarter kind of takes out Huawei. What is -- what should we assume from the following quarters? Should we just assume Huawei goes to 0 after that? What is the right way to kind of derisk the model from a Huawei perspective? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Yes. So for the current quarter, Q3, we've presumed no more shipments. And if you take -- I think your assumption is let's assume that, that ban stays in place, then it's likely that we would be prohibited from continuing to sell to that customer for subsequent quarters. But as Vince has mentioned several times, we are largely customer-agnostic. We have high share in all of the carriers. It's a very different situation than what we had in 4G. So as that demand shifts to other wireless infrastructure carriers, depending on where that deployment happens, we expect to continue to do quite well in providing the necessary technology to enable the deployment of 5G and the continuing deployment and growth of 4G. Operator : Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Harsh Kumar : I want to echo my congratulations as well, fantastic job in this rather turbulent environment. I want to follow up on the Vivek's question. Last time we saw this, the song and dance was ZTE getting banned and the expectation was that Huawei would step up and take share. So basically, if I hear you correctly, what I think you're saying is that the customer in question, Huawei, if that's banned, you are suggesting that others, including ZTE, might step up and take share and the impact would be much less than perhaps the direct business that you do with Huawei. Is that the correct way to think about it? Vincent Roche : Potentially, yes. I think it really depends now on how the Chinese government and the various carriers, when they reflect on things, how they decide to handle the timing of 5G release at this point in time. But there are options. I think 5G conforms to a standard. And I think all the carriers have different options. They probably have favorites. They've got the first favorite, the second favorite. But there are options. And the way we view it, we are well positioned in terms of our technology portfolio. In fact, many of the things we're doing, particularly in 5G, are highly differentiated, with more content, more coverage in the radio systems than we've ever had. So look, it will certainly help a lot if this trade -- this ban is lifted in a reasonable time period here. But I think irrespective, as I said in my earlier comments, the rollout of 5G is unquestionable. And it will really be a question of timing rather than if the system gets deployed. So yes. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Harsh, so just to, I'll say, unpack a little bit from kind of a numbers standpoint. The things we looked at when we put together our guidance was there's 3 factors. One was the actual shipments to that customer; two were the secondary impact to other customers who ship to that customer; and third would be additional demand picked up by competitors on that customer. And we put all that together, that's how we came up with our guidance. And we kind of think the second, too, so the secondary impact or the additional share impact kind of neutralize to 0. So really, it's all about that customer going to 0 in our outlook. Harsh Kumar : Fair enough. Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, we've been trying to talk to other semiconductor companies. And they're all very confused because of just -- it happened -- it all happened so recently. A lot of the companies are saying, well, they sell directly to Huawei, but they also sell a whole bunch through distri. Would you tell us if you guys are prohibited from selling through distri to Huawei as well? Or is there a chance that stuff could -- shipments could be moved around a little bit and perhaps -- I'm not saying the full impact is mitigated, but some partial impact is mitigated at this point? Vincent Roche : No, I'd say, look, we're as confused as everybody. The information flow is burst-y and it can be often confusing. So I think the coming days, the coming weeks will bring a lot more clarity to what's actually in the ban and what's out of the ban. But as Mike said very clearly right now, our interpretation is that we will be upholding the ban to the fullest extent and we won't be shipping anything to Huawei for the foreseeable future. Michael Lucarelli : And for the avoidance of doubt, we have no channel revenue in the midpoint of our guidance that we expect to go on to this communications customer. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : The defense spending budget for this year has been a real tailwind for the team. And it's actually been quite broad-based, right, modernization, aircraft, ground systems, missile defense and so on. A&D obviously has been doing well for the team. Can you just help us understand how A&D has been growing on a year-over-year basis? And then how has the budget focus on modernization helped to kick off maybe some new potential initiatives for the team? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Harlan, we don't talk much at the specific segment level in terms of numbers. But I will share that our aerospace and defense has been doing particularly well. And it was one of the items that helped us offset some of the decline we saw in other industrial. The overall -- sort of in the second quarter results, that year-over-year growth was pretty substantial, I call it north of 25% on a year-over-year basis for aerospace. We are benefiting from those record military budgets that you've meant. So it's across all of our application areas, the communications, the UAVs, radars, space exploration areas. The combination with Hittite also helped bring a lot of new technologies that we can take advantage. So it's been a great business for us. And we see that continued modernization of defense is going to pay dividends in growth for ADI for several quarters to come. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. And just to level set on the call, our industrial business is 50% of sales, but it's very diverse within that 50%. So I'll just remind everyone that aerospace and defense is about 20% of industrial, automation is about 20% of industrial, instrumentation is about 20% to 25%, health care is just above 10% and then there's a remainder across a bunch of, I'll call it, smaller customers. So it's a very diverse business within industrial for us. Do you have a follow-up, Harlan? Harlan Sur : Yes. I appreciate the insights. So within the comms business, really appreciate the insights on some of the new opportunities in optical, especially around signal processing and control. I believe that within wireline though over the past couple of quarters, you've seen some weakness in 100 gig for optical networking targeted at cloud data centers on the well-known sort of capacity digestion by the hyperscalers. Are you guys starting to see fundamentals in 100 gig starting to improve kind of near term? Michael Lucarelli : Yes.  And our wireline business had been growing. In the last quarter, it grew mid-single digits year-over-year. And the quarter before that was about 10% year-over-year. So I think it is impacting some. Our wireline business has been a quite steady growth market for us. It's been overshadowed by the wireless, I'll say, actually growing much faster. But the wireline for us and optical within that has been growing. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think data centers today still largely 100 gig-based. But the fastest growth we're experiencing is in 400 gig. And that's both the kind of the metro long-haul as well as data centers. So as this data need continues to double every 2.5 years, we're going to continue to see an aggressive move into 400 gig, and in fact, to 1 terabit and beyond over the coming few years here. So I think it's a mixture. And we're seeing strength across the board in our portfolio. Operator : And our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : First, congratulations on the automotive business being flat year-over-year. It's a solid quarter by any measure. I know, Vince, you gave the color on some of those drivers with BMS, et cetera. But from a bigger-picture perspective, you guys had been underperforming for a few years. And now you're outperforming. Is this a sign of an inflection point that you think like going forward, you can go back to at least performing in line with peers or even outperforming? Or do you view this as just kind of 1 quarter of improvement in that regard? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So Ross, let me level set how we did in the first half, and then let Vince kind of talk more broadly. So first, remember that we run our business on a -- we run the channel really on a POS basis, but we report our revenue on a POA basis. So in the second quarter, POS was down just slightly, very low single digits, but much better versus units. So we did see a little bit of modest build in the channel. And that helped growth. But within that, certainly very strong performance in BMS, power and A2B. Vince mentioned that we've got the cabin electronics and some other businesses exposed to SAAR. So as we look forward to the second half of this year, a little bit of that channel build that we saw in the first half is probably going to provide some headwind because again we do manage the business on a POS basis. But the optimism that we have been talking about for over a year now and the inflection in our auto business that we really expect to start in 2020, that remains a high conviction. And I'll let Vince maybe talk more about what's behind that. Vincent Roche : Ross, if we go back several years, we withdrew R&D and support. We still ship some sensor products. But we've largely seen the, I think, the tailing off of some of our more commoditized MEMS sensing business begin to stabilize there. If I look at the areas where we're seeing the growth come from as a company, I think our infotainment business remains very, very strong. It's been growing year-on-year now for several. BMS, still a very, very small penetration of electric vehicles in overall SAAR. And by the month, we get more and more convinced that, that's going to be a very significant business for the company. And that's -- that business is doing better and better for us. In fact, we have been capitalizing that business as well. We -- in comparison, if you'd like, the portfolio from LTC, so we've been capitalizing the business in terms of R&D and equipment to make sure that we can meet the upside demand here for new products as well as supply line for the long term. I mentioned a little bit earlier on as well that our power business, the LT portfolio is doing increasingly better when compared to the market at large. And when you take these new, emerging Level 3, Level 4 sensing systems that need, call it, modalities like IMUs, that need these advanced image quality radar systems and LIDAR, we are in virtually all the really important high-end solutions that are emerging at Level 3 and above. So I think our business has been largely the -- the headwind on our business from the sensor side of things is abating. And these new product modalities are getting stronger and stronger in terms of traction. So that's kind of the story in automotive for you. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yes. I just wanted to pivot back to the comms side of things and appreciating all the uncertainty and the details you've given on the call thus far. One other aspect that investors are focused on is the inventory in that area. And I know it's difficult to discern. But how are you viewing any prebuying that might have been occurring specifically from the now-banned customer? And I think what people are concerned about is even if the ban ends, was there enough prebuying buffer that the snapback afterwards might not actually occur? So any color you could have on the inventory in that channel and specifically any prebuying would be appreciated. Vincent Roche : I think the inventory in general, Ross, across the board, all are OEMs in the communications area, these new advanced architectures. I think the inventory is very, very well balanced. I don't see anything untoward or anomalous. And I think things are in good balance there. Michael Lucarelli : Yes, Ross. I'll say even before the ban came in place, we expect our communications business -- we thought before that ban was going to grow sequentially. So I don't think prebuying was a big worry of ours, given our good share across the board. Now that obviously has changed. And we think it's not going to grow sequentially. And probably on a year-over-year basis, it's only up slightly. Kind of help you for some context there. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think the way to think about this as well in terms of inventory balance, like most of ADI's portfolio, it's really more a question of when the inventories that we have sell rather than if. I think that's generic to all these core B2B businesses for ADI. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. William Stein : First, I'm wondering if you've analyzed or if there's any impact we might expect from additional stop ship orders that have been speculated in the press. For example, I think it's pronounced HikVision. I might not be getting that right. But I'm wondering if you have an exposure to these surveillance companies in China that look like they could potentially be customers. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Well, it's a good question. I would emphasize that the rest of the ADI business is very broad and diverse. So as more companies may be identified, there will certainly be some analysis that we will have to do. But unlike the communications business, which is among our most concentrated, the diversity of our franchise and the large number of customers that we sell to provide great insulation against having kind of macro shocks from these political impacts. William Stein : That's really helpful. One more if I can. Can you talk about both for the quarter, juxtapose it in for the guidance, the trends within the consumer business and specifically the split between your traditional prosumer business and the more volatile handset part of the business? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. So we've -- we originally said the -- that consumer is going to be down 10% to 20% in 2019. Our forecast is really now at the high end of that. We expect to be down 20% year-over-year. We continue to see some weakness in the portables market. We are seeing a little bit of unanticipated weakness in prosumer. And how much of that is driven by the macro environments and such, we're trying to assess right now. But we do think that kind of the worst is behind us and that the long-term growth for the prosumer business should really align closer to GDP. And it's really similar to our B2B business. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. From a standpoint, as we exit this year, we expect our portables business and our prosumer business to be about equal in size, so that should provide some more stability to that consumer business for us going forward. Operator : Our last question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I just wanted to make sure I understood the exposure to the large customer and in terms of the model, Prashanth. Should we be then thinking -- you gave us a trailing 12-month number. But should we be thinking high single digit? And then based on your answer to an earlier question in terms of derisking the model, should we assume for the next 2, 3 quarters, you get none of that and then you start to -- other customers to pick up slack maybe 2, 3 quarters down the road? Is that the right way to think about the model and then the OpEx impact as well? Michael Lucarelli : Ambrish, I'll answer the first part of your question. So I think we were pretty clear on the prepared remarks saying our largest customers within comms was mid-single digit at most in the trailing 12 months. We did have a couple weeks of shipments, I would say, in this quarter. So that won't repeat next quarter. And after that doesn't repeat in 3Q, I would put 0 in going forward until the ban is lifted. Ambrish Srivastava : And the OpEx trajectory, how should we think about the OpEx? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Look, the OpEx is -- we're going to continue to invest in the business. Of course, where appropriate, we're going to look at our discretionary cost. But I wouldn't make a meaningful change to how we think about the OpEx. The first lever that absorbs the chock of our revenue decline is our variable compensation. So that will, of course, be impacted by decline in revenue. But beyond that, we're going to -- we're committed to investing today for products and technologies that come to market several years out. Vincent Roche : I think the way to look at it, Ambrish, is that the demand for our technologies is absolutely unprecedented. So we're keeping our eye on the long term in terms of making sure that we have aggressive funding in place to fund all the R&D programs that we think are critical to the company's future, the same with our customer engagements. And I mentioned a little while ago also, we ramped our capital expenditures to make sure, particularly on the LT side of the business, that we have what we need to get our products to market faster and get the supply to our customers, that we know the opportunity is there, so we're keeping our eye on the long-term prize here. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : I do. Just a quick one then. In your B2B guide, I think, Vince, you mentioned -- you gave the color on the industrial. And then should auto -- we should expect that to be up year-over-year in the current quarter that we are in? Michael Lucarelli : Yes, Ambrish, yes.  Vince gave some comments. Industrial actually should be down year-over-year, but the growth will be better than the second quarter is how to think about industrial first off. Auto also, I would say, probably down year-over-year but much better than what I would say units are doing out there to the thing we talked about in the other Q&A remarks, BMS and power and A2B ramping. And communications, we also discussed it should be about, I would say, flat to up slightly year-over-year. So that should kind of help you get to that low single-digit guide for B2B as a combination. With that, thank you, Ambrish, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. And all available reconciliations will also be on the website. Thank you, and we'll talk to you guys soon. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today about ADI's third quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from these prior quarters and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about the non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.  I also want to point out that during the third quarter, we improved our method to more accurately estimate the end-market classification for shipments to distributors. This resulted in some modest changes to historical end-market revenue breakdown but did not change our total revenue or EPS. We have posted a quarterly end-market look back based on this improved method to our Investor website. Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment, we executed soundly in our third fiscal quarter and delivered solid results. Revenue of $1.48 billion in the third quarter came in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our B2B markets decreased 3% year-over-year, given the weaker macro conditions, and performed well relative to the market. This performance is testament to the diversity of our franchise and investing ahead of secular trends to drive ongoing share gains and some expansion. Operating margins of approximately 41% were above our guidance as we moved quickly to reduce expenses given the ongoing market weakness. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.26. Over the past 12 months, we've generated approximately $2 billion in free cash flow or 33% of revenue. And during the same time period, we have returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments. Now while there are clearly a number of near-term external challenges we're navigating through, ADI has always been and remains focused on delivering sustainable long-term profitable growth. To that end, before Prashanth covers our financial results in more detail, I'm going to continue our quarterly practice of providing a deeper level of insight into one of our markets, the trends influencing its future and how we are positioned to capitalize in these trends over the long term. So today, I'd like to discuss the emerging automotive electrification ecosystem that is supporting a number of underlying industries from energy to transportation to manufacturing and, indeed, beyond and paving the way for the transition to cleaner energy sources. ADI has always been focused on making the most efficient use of energy in both our products and operations, and I'm proud to say that we are playing an important role in this new wave of electrification. We approach automotive electrification from an ecosystem perspective. That is to say, the electric vehicle is just one element. For ADI, the origin of our journey starts with the formation of the battery. It then extends to the ongoing management of an installed electric vehicles battery system and then to powering the supporting electrical infrastructure needed to fuel EVs. The common thread woven through all of these applications is the precision signal processing, control and power management capabilities they require, capabilities indeed in which ADI excels. So let me explain a bit more. Our value journey starts with battery formation and test, a time-consuming and complex chemical process where extremely precise measurement means the difference between a safe, high-quality battery and a low quality one. The lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles represent nearly 1/3 of the entire cost of the vehicle, so OEMs place a high premium on battery quality and reliability. Our portfolio of fully integrated precision signal processing, control and power products allows ADI to offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, safety and reliability for their battery formation and test process. Our solutions reduce battery formation costs by 2/3 by shrinking our customers' equipment footprint by 4x and enabling up to 95% power reuse, which reduces environmental impact as well. Once the battery system has been manufactured, our opportunity grows with electrification applications within the vehicle itself. Here, our technology is a key enabler in the transition from combustion engines to cleaner electric vehicles, which are projected to grow from the current 2% worldwide vehicle sales to more than 20% over the next decade or so. In the vehicle, the battery management system, or BMS, provide precise monitoring and control of the complex charge and discharge cycles of the battery system. Accuracy and safety in the BMS are critical since overcharging or undercharging can lead to the battery's destruction and render it useless. The accuracy of the BMS is also a major determining factor in the performance of the EV as it directly affects the miles per charge an electric vehicle can safely deliver. And to add to the challenge, that accuracy needs to be maintained through extreme environmental conditions and harsh interference over the 10-plus year life cycle of the car. Such an application challenge is a perfect fit for ADI where we once again leverage our deep heritage and accurate precision measurement to provide optimized solutions for battery management. We've got the industry's broadest IC portfolio supporting all battery voltages from 48 volts to 800 volts, covering the full range of premium electric vehicles right down to the entry level. Our products are also designed specifically for harsh automotive environments, enabling us to deliver up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. We deliver the highest level of automotive functional safety and have a full suite of powerful safety diagnostics that are easy to integrate and use. So thanks to these advantages, we now have a leadership position across key customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, giving us confidence that we can continue to grow BMS revenue at a double-digit annual rate. And we continue to push the innovation curve. Future generations on our BMS road map include architectural innovations that will improve the way power density, accuracy and weight challenges are solved, including the ability to wirelessly and robustly communicate. And finally, our opportunity extends beyond the car to the charging station infrastructure that sources, stores and transfers the energy that powers electric vehicles. Charging stations represent a unique challenge for electric grids due to their intermittent and substantial demand peaks, and they must also effectively and cost efficiently meet the fast-charging requirements consumers demand for their EVs. As a result, charging stations will rely on battery-powered energy storage systems to accurately and quickly charge a vehicle. Here, the precision of our BMS solution can reduce the total cost of ownership of the energy storage system by 1/3 by extending the battery's life by up to 2x and lowering maintenance costs. As demand for batteries rises, we're beginning to see a push towards extending a battery's useful life by enabling a second life for EV batteries and infrastructure applications. We believe ADI's best-in-class measurement capabilities will become increasingly important as this market matures and these second-life deployments begin to scale. So in closing, electrification represents a highly valuable market for ADI for the long term. It presents a number of difficult challenges for our customers, challenges that our portfolio and people are transforming into opportunities every day. Through our battery management, power conversion, connectivity and isolation technologies, we're delivering innovative solutions that position us to capture revenue growth opportunities throughout the electrification ecosystem today and well into the future.  And so with that, let me hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financial details. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comment today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Before I get to the results for the quarter, I wanted to provide some details related to the ongoing situation with Huawei. A few weeks into our third quarter, the Commerce Department added them to the BIS Entity List. ADI immediately suspended shipments of all products. After a thorough review of the Export Administration Regulations and the Entity List restrictions, we determined that we could lawfully resume shipping selected ADI products to this customer. We are closely monitoring this dynamic situation and feel that we are well positioned to adapt as the circumstances evolve. The scope, duration and long-term financial impact of the export restrictions remain unclear and difficult to predict. But at least for the near term, our Huawei demand has taken a step down from previous levels. As a result, we are planning for sales to this customer to be meaningfully below our previous mid-single-digit percentage range, which we discussed with you last quarter. This is reflected in our guidance, which is published in our earnings release. So now let's get on to the quarter. ADI delivered a strong third quarter with revenue, operating margin and EPS all above the midpoint of guidance. Our B2B revenue was down a modest 3% year-over-year as growth in communications was balanced by ongoing weakness in industrial and automotive markets. The industrial market, which represented 51% of sales in the quarter, decreased 4% year-over-year. And while most applications were down year-over-year, we saw continued strength in our aerospace, defense, health care and electronic test and measurement businesses. Communications represented 21% of sales during the quarter and grew 7% year-over-year. While both wireless and wired results were impacted by Huawei, our wireless sales still increased double digits year-over-year driven by record revenue across multiple customers, a testament to our balanced and market-leading position in advanced radio systems used in the 5G infrastructure. Automotive represented 15% of sales and was down 9% year-over-year, reflective of the ongoing decline in global vehicle sales. Year-to-date, our auto revenue is down double digits year-over-year, outperforming a declining SAAR due to strength in BMS, which has increased double digits over this time and the ongoing momentum in our power franchise. And lastly, consumer made up 12% of sales and decreased 18% year-over-year.  So now let's go to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was above the midpoint of guidance at approximately $1.48 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Gross margins came in at 70.4%, down 20 basis points sequentially due to lower factory utilization. And in what is normally a higher OpEx quarter due to our merit increases, we reduced OpEx by $6 million sequentially to $438 million. And as we continue to navigate these challenging times, you can look for us to keep a tight rein on discretionary and nonessential spending. Our prudent OpEx spend offset slightly lower gross margins and resulted in op margins of 40.8%, above the midpoint of guidance. Nonop expenses in the quarter were down $4 million sequentially driven by lower interest expense as we continue to reduce debt. And the tax rate for the quarter was 14%, in line with our outlook. All told, the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance at $1.26. Let me comment on the balance sheet. We exited the quarter at 129 days of inventory, above the high end of our target range of 115 to 125. This increase related primarily to weaker Huawei demand and as we discussed with you in the first quarter earnings call, the initial build of our bridge inventory to support the planned closure of 2 manufacturing facilities in early 2021. As a reminder, we expect to generate $100 million of cost of goods synergies related to these facility closures. And during this transitional phase, we expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of inventory to support our customers. Channel inventory was just over 8 weeks as we exited the third quarter, and CapEx returned to our normal level of 4% of sales or $58 million as much of our colocation activities are now complete. We've generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. And during that time, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. Specifically, in the third quarter, we repaid $300 million of debt, paid $200 million in dividends and repurchased over $100 million of our stock.  So now let's move to guidance, which, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will also be discussed on an adjusted basis. Revenue is expected to be $1.45 billion, plus or minus $50 million. And at the midpoint, we expect our B2B market of industrial automotive and communications in the aggregate to decrease low to mid-single digits year-over-year. And as a point of reference, if we back Huawei out of our year-over-year Q4 compares, B2B is roughly flat. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint. And nonop expenses are expected to decline sequentially by approximately $5 million, and the tax rate will remain in the 13% to 15% range. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.22, plus or minus $0.07.  So in closing, we are pleased with our quarter results given the current macro and geopolitical climate. And during these uncertain times, we will carefully manage our expenses while also investing strategically in areas that continue to position us to deliver profitable growth over the long term.  So let me hand it back to Mike, so we can start our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Now let's get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Sheryl, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Congratulations on your solid results given the backdrop. Vince, I'm wondering if you could help me better understand, clearly, I think one of the consequences of the trade dispute between China and the U.S. is that Huawei is more intent to kind of be able to build a base station with non-U.S. suppliers. I'm wondering if you can help me understand, from your perspective and the sockets you play in, how easily can Huawei do that. Do you view Huawei as just a transitory issue for the company? Or do you think there could be some long-term real socket share loss as Huawei tries to lessen its dependence on U.S. component suppliers? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, John. We've been -- as a company, we're in business almost 55 years now, and we've been competing with players from all over the globe in all areas of our business, different players in different spaces. But what I will say is, in general, we've taken the highest performance position in 5G base stations in the radio system. And whether that is Chinese OEMs that are absorbing our products, European, whatever, Korean, that is our game. And as these systems become ever more complex, performance matters more and more and more when you're trying to really put more information density through every radio. That's where we play and nobody competes with us at that level. There are perhaps different ways to solve the problem. You can sacrifice performance, perhaps. But if you're looking for the best-in-class 5G radio performance, it's ADI that the OEMs are coming to.  And one of the thoughts I want to leave you with, John, is that whatever happens, the ongoing situation with regard to Huawei, we are very well penetrated as a corporation across the globe with all the OEMs. So no matter what happens, we will grow in 2020. That's the -- that is the expectation. So competition is just a facet of doing business, and we're more than well prepared with the portfolio of products we already have and the products that we have coming. So -- and I want to make it clear as well that the restriction that we're experiencing with regard to shipping into Huawei specifically is around 5G. Our legacy 4G products have been shipping and, as far as I understand, will continue to ship. So also, it's an evolving situation. And we are doing everything we can to be able to satisfy the needs of all our customers. And in China, specifically, we are in the process of seeking the licenses that we need to support our products in the short to medium term here. So hopefully, that answers your question, John. John Pitzer : That's helpful. Yes. Just one quick, guys. In your prepared comments, Prashanth mentioned that excluding for Huawei, your B2B business would be kind of flat year-over-year in the October quarter, which is meaningfully better than your peers. Is that mainly still just a comms phenomenon, which I think is well understood by investors? Or can you talk about bottoms-up drivers in the industrial and auto that might be helping you guys drive that outperformance on year-on-year growth? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. I think industrial is -- it is much more than comms. I think we're very pleased with how strong our industrial business is. But let me have Mike kind of break down how to think about it on a year-over-year basis if you back out Huawei. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. So, John, the question -- so if you look at our outlook, it kind of assumes, I would say, pretty much flattish year-over-year in industrial. If you move on to automotive, it's down about 10%. And comms is also down by 10%. But if you have to back out Huawei, comms is up once again year-over-year. And that is what Mark kind of -- I think our 11th or 12th quarter in a row of year-over-year growth in comms. So that kind of goes with what Vince said about the breadth of our portfolio across customers. And if you move away from B2B into consumer, it's down double digits. And it kind of right in the line for the year, down about 20%. I don't -- Vince, do you want to talk about industrial and kind of the strength we're seeing there and why we've been better than our peers? Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think if you look at industrial in kind of 2 pockets, we have our more fragmented, broader-based business, specifically automation. And I say, that business right now, given its high-intensity CapEx needs, is weaker pretty much across all geographic spaces at this point in time. I don't think it'll be a great surprise to tell you that the memory test business has been weak now almost for a year, and that persists. It remains at least tepid. But I think the areas where we're seeing most strength right now are aerospace and defense. And in fact, that's increasing just about 20% year-over-year. Given the record defense budget that has just been passed in the U.S., we're seeing good growth across all the sub applications within aerospace and defense. And one of the real points of strength for ADI and what's driving a lot of the growth is the combination of the microwave and RF technologies from Hittite with the mixed-signal products from ADI. And we're starting to bring LTC more aggressively into that space as well. So that's a future growth dimension in that aerospace and defense business. Health care continues to grow nicely, I think in general. I've been pretty public that I think that's a space whose time has really come. And I think this digital health area, in general, is just an inflection point. It's just at the knee of the curve, so to speak. So that's doing well for us across the board, whether it's big iron or clinical-grade patient-monitoring-type systems. And given again the growth in areas like 5G, BMS, very, very high-frequency automotive radar safety systems, the electronic test and measurement side of things is performing well also. So I think that helps unpack the industrial story, hopefully, for you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Congratulations on the execution in this environment. First question is on communications. Vince, you said you expect to grow pretty nicely in calendar '20. I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that. I mean is that when 5G kind of really kicks in? Because obviously up until now, a lot of the growth has been more 4.5G. So if you could elaborate on that, please. Vincent Roche : Yes. So thanks, Tore. The -- look, I think the way to think about 5G is one of the most exciting new platforms to be introduced in the world of information and communications technology for several years. So it's very -- I believe it'll be very pervasive. It's in the early stages of deployment. We're looking at a multiyear cycle here. One of the things I think is -- that's important to remember with 5G is that it's really designed to enable B2B users to modify their business models and their offerings to their customers, whether it's in industrial, whether it's in health care, where critical connection to the system is really important. So I think it's less about the consumer, more about B2B.  Data is doubling every couple of years. So the need for bandwidth and very low latency is real, and it's necessary. And that won't abate. That will continue to intensify over time. And the only way to some of that is by delivering more special -- spectrum efficiency. So I think what we're seeing is very, very early stage deployment. And the radio is one of the most critical elements in the development and deployment of these new 5G systems. And I think over the next 3, 4 years, we'll start to see the virtualization of the network and a more aggressive introduction of the microwave technologies as well that will be the next generation of 5G. So I think, as you know, as I said in the -- in an earlier comment there, we're very well positioned technologically. The problems are getting tougher and tougher in the base station from a performance standpoint. So the portfolio lines very well gets ahead of our customers' needs there. And we're very well penetrated across the board in terms of the breadth of our portfolio and the depth of our portfolio. I will also point out that the power portfolio from LT is nicely fitting in as well, so that's another wave of growth that we'll begin to see materialize during 2020, 2021. Michael Lucarelli : Hey, Tore, do you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes. As a follow-up, you talked about the electrification in BMS. I'm just wondering, when you're talking to your automotive customers right now, and especially given the sort of challenging SAAR environment, are you seeing an acceleration in the designs for BMS and EV? Vincent Roche : Very definitely, Tore. I think it's -- whether it's European, U.S., Japanese or Asian OEMs, there's a pervasive move towards electrification of the powertrain. So the -- we're very confident that the BMS portfolio that we have -- we're on our fifth-generation incidentally. And having met several of these OEMs over the last quarter or 2, I can tell you that there's a level of intensity and urgency to move more towards electrical powertrains. And given that BMS or electric powertrains today represent somewhere around 2% of all the vehicles built, that's likely to increase by an order of magnitude over the next decade or so. So I think it's very real. I certainly am growing in confidence that these trends that we're seeing is becoming more intense, and it's something that we're very well positioned to take advantage of.  I mentioned as well in the prepared remarks that we're moving on to yet another generation. We're changing the way the connectivity of the information is rendered in the car with our new wireless BMS architecture, which we've introduced to the market, and we'll start to see, I think, significant revenue accrue there in the kind of 2021 time frame. Operator : Our next question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : So I think one of the more interesting things about ADI is just kind of the ramp in the content you guys are seeing on 5G. So I just want to clarify what you guys are talking about for 2020. So if we assume that Huawei is entirely banned, you guys still believe you're going to see, I guess, a notable growth within communications. Is that fair? Vincent Roche : Yes. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Absolutely. Yes. Without a doubt. So it goes to : one, we have very good share across the ecosystem; and two, the additional content we see in these systems. There's 2 flavors really at 5G. I would say there's the subset gigahertz. And in those systems, our silicon content is about 4x that of a traditional 4G. And then as you move to higher frequency millimeter wave, there's additional content on top of that 4x that's also an opportunity for ADI. That's really the ADI-Hittite portfolio. And also Linear, we're bringing in there as well. Mitch Steves : Got it. Okay. And then secondly, I kind of want to turn a little quickly to the industrial segment. I mean it looks like you guys are gaining share there. I'm curious to get what you guys think the overall market is doing within industrial and if you guys think it is -- this is something you can sustain over the next few quarters as well. So I'm not saying that the industrial segment won't grow, but more just in terms of you guys being able to continue to gain share against companies like TI. Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, this is an area where -- I mean this is the core of ADI in many ways. And it represents about half of the company's total revenue. About 7, 8, 9 years ago, we retooled the entire investment portfolio of the company from an R&D and from a go-to-market perspective and just focused more intensely on B2B applications. And industrial has been the priority there. So I think what we're seeing now is the benefit of the new product crop that we've been able to introduce there. We've a lot of exciting new things coming that are in the pipeline, that are in the cusp of materializing into revenue. So also, our customer engagements are continuing to evolve from, I would say, 7, 8, 9 years ago, we were largely a component provider, now we're providing different forms of solutions, collections of components, more highly integrated products for different types of applications. So I think in many, many ways, what we're seeing now is the culmination of many, many years of very targeted activity to become stronger in industrial. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Mitch, I might just add that remember, this particular market is very sticky. So the momentum that we have, as Vince talked about, has taken several years to build. And once you have it, you kind of roll with it. And I would expect to see that continued strength versus the broader market play out over the coming years. Operator : Our next question comes from C.J. Muse, Evercore. Christopher Muse : Vince, you talked in great deal on the BMS side, I was hoping just to follow up there. As you think about increasing technology requirements within the portfolio and how you're investing and proceeding there, I guess two questions. One, I think it's about 5% of your revenues today. Where do you think that can be 5 years from now? And then two, how are you seeing changes in the competitive landscape as we proceed both electric vehicles and hybrid from here? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, C.J. First and foremost, we're playing on the high end. Our portfolio is targeted as kind of mid- to high-end applications where the problems are the toughest. And we're able to leverage our strength in precision signal processing that really has been the mainstay of the company for the last 5 decades. I would say, in terms of what you can expect in terms of growth, my sense is this will be a double-digit growth area for several years to come. Christopher Muse : Great. And I guess as a follow-up for Prashanth. At what point in terms of outstanding debt would you focus 100% of your free cash flow on buybacks and dividend as opposed to paying down debt? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Good question, C.J. I don't want to lock us into a specific position, but I'll say a couple of comments.  One, this is a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash flow. So compared to how the company was run several years ago, we are very comfortable with debt on the balance sheet. And I don't see it ever moving to kind of the large cash surplus that we used to be at. What is -- we're really focused on maintaining that investment-grade rating. So we're going to be mindful of what the broader interest rate environment looks like and how the ratings agencies view us to ensure that we're doing what's necessary to kind of maintain that investment grade. Now having said that, we're going to throw off a lot of cash. We just did a refi 2 -- actually, a quarter ago where we moved some of our 5-year term into a shorter duration. So expect us to kind of continue moving to drive that down. And I would highlight that we have been meaningfully taking down our share count in 2019, and I think you can expect us to continue to do that in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach, Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : On auto electrification in terms of your positioning and long-term growth drivers. A number of suppliers have noted just near-term weakness in China just from subset perspective and uncertainty around demand. Any color that you have in terms of what you're seeing in the China market on a near-term basis? Michael Lucarelli : Craig, yes. I mean we play in the market. We have market-leading position across geos. China is a big market for us. What I'll say is, yes, last quarter, we did grow year-over-year, but it was less than 2Q in BMS, but we still did grow. But it's a lumpy deployment-based business. If you look over the year-to-date, we're up double digits. And we expect to grow year-over-year again in our fourth quarter even with what's going on in China. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And Craig, I do want to maybe reiterate the prepared remarks that Vince mentioned. For us, it is much more than just about managing the battery as efficiently as possible. We enjoy growth with the processors who form and test the batteries. We have the LTC capabilities that help drive efficient use of that power to help extend the range. And we're also in the charging station. So as the whole ecosystem continues to build out to support electric vehicles, for us, it's a much bigger play than just focusing on the batteries. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Craig? Craig Hettenbach : Understood. Yes. I guess the follow-up, Prashanth, just on the manufacturing and some of the things you're doing with the footprint consolidation. Any update in terms of gross margin impact of when you would expect to see some synergies from that? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our inventory is a little bit higher this quarter because we are starting to put the bridge inventory that's necessary for us to be able to close the facilities in Singapore and California. So we'll need that bridge inventory so that we can continue to serve customers while we take those facilities down. We are targeting those savings to start coming through the P&L in 2021, early 2021. And that -- as we've been public in several calls, that should be about an incremental $100 million on a run rate basis that's all flowing through cost of goods sold. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Michael Lucarelli : Vivek? Okay. Vivek, we're going to go to the next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Let's start with OpEx. So obviously, you mentioned being a little more constrained on expenses given the environment. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that OpEx trajectory going into Q4? Are you sort of bottomed to this point given where variable comp is on the metrics? Or is there room to still take OpEx down? I guess what are the implications for OpEx given the continued weak environment that you've seen? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks for the question, Stacy. So I think the way to -- first, as a reminder, we don't guide gross margins anymore. If I answer your OpEx question, I am implicitly giving you that guidance, but... Stacy Rasgon : Qualitatively. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. The way to think about it is, we are -- we're -- we have made a meaningful reduction in our OpEx versus our Q2. So we had a sequential improvement going into Q3. We're looking for that to kind of carry roughly flattish for the fourth quarter. We will focus on the variable costs that we can control and continue to exercise OpEx discipline. As we've said before, one of the leverage we do have is our compensation system, which is meant to act as a flywheel as the businesses go up and down, and that will certainly be an element of the Q4. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Stacy? Stacy Rasgon : Got it. I do. So in the prepared remarks, Vince mentioned that obviously the macro environment is still challenging, isn't getting better in the near term. Would you say that from your perspective versus where your expectations were 3 months ago, have things gotten worse versus what your prior expectations had been? I guess just where have you been expecting things to kind of go into the year-end? And are things worse than that? Or are they sort of similar to where you would expect them to be 3 months ago? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Stacy. I'd say, the uncertainty in the trade tensions between America and China has obviously ratcheted up. I think it's indeterminate what will actually happen there in the short to medium term. PMI indices as well as GDPs are falling somewhat. So I think that headwind has increased somewhat, I think, since the last quarter. I think when I try to classify how customers are thinking about the world, the world of technology is gearing up. There's more and more innovation. The R&D budgets are very, very strong across the globe and all the sectors. So I think customers remain optimistic about the future. But I'd say, right at this point in time, the people who commit the CapEx, commit the investments are probably a little less optimistic about the future than they were, say, a quarter ago. So that's pretty much the best commentary I can give you, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. I guess at our conference at the end of May, Vince, you would sound pretty positive about potentially getting a trade deal. It doesn't sound like were there anymore. Vincent Roche : Well, it's -- who really knows? I think both sides are working on it. I think incidentally, both sides want the deal, but I think it depends on the conditions. And what's out there in the public domain is that both sides are digging their heels in at this point. So yes, I'd say, Stacy, to answer your question directly, the sense of a trade deal by the end of the summer, which is looming very quickly here, is less likely than it was when you and I spoke back in May. Michael Lucarelli : All right, Stacy. Thank you the 3 points you guys you have in there. Vincent Roche : Sorry, we're going to try to go back to Vivek, if we can. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. And that'll be our last question for today. Operator : Okay. Your next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Can you hear me now? Michael Lucarelli : We can, Vivek. Vivek Arya : Okay. Sorry for the -- I screwed up before. So first question, how should we think about seasonality going into your January quarter? Historically, it's a positive quarter. But I know you've had consumer volatility and this time, there's also the Huawei and trade war volatilities. I'm just curious, how's your visibility kind of 1 quarter out right now? Michael Lucarelli : I'll tell you, typical seasonality. I would say, it's not a typical time. I'll caveat with that, and we're not giving guidance for a quarter out. Typically, first quarter is a weaker quarter for us in B2B. Industrial is typically down. Automotive is typically down. I do think on the comms market, we talked about being weaker here in the fourth quarter, but it's very volatile. And I think you see a quick acceleration back there in the first quarter. And consumer, we'll update you on next call kind of our outlook for 2020. But I think you can expect consumer to be down again in 2020 but to a lesser degree than '19. Vivek Arya : All right. And then the other thing... Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Vivek? Vivek Arya : Yes. The other thing, Vince, I know there is a lot of macro uncertainty right now. But when I look at your automotive and industrial businesses, they were down kind of 6% year-on-year for the last couple of quarters. If I look at the guidance you're giving for October, it's down about -- I think about 2% year-on-year, and you were saying industrial can be actually flat year-on-year, which is much better than what we have seen in the last few quarters. So I'm just trying to reconcile all the uncertainty in the macro environment versus the October quarter kind of industrial outlook. That seems somewhat more positive when I look at it. Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, we have a couple of specific areas where we're seeing strength, aerospace and defense, being kind of top of the list there for a range of reasons. It's a combination of budgets being increased in the area of aerospace and defense and also the strength of the technology portfolio that we bring. And I mentioned earlier on that health care continues to grow for the company. It's an area again where we've been increasing investments over the last 5, 7 years. And that's an area that I continue to be very optimistic about and think it will be a very good source of growth for the company for many, many years to come. So there are the 2 areas, Vivek, that are most meaningfully contributing on the industrial side right now to the strength we're seeing relative to the market. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And Vivek, I know you asked specifically about the change in trajectory in Q4, but I would want to remind you that kind of on a year-to-date basis, those numbers you've quoted have been substantially better than the broader market. So we have outperformed. Although the industrial market has been down on a year-to-date basis for us, we've generally outperformed the broader market. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Vivek. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and information can also be found there. Thanks again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you in 90 days. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. Anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. And we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today about ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. Comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. As a reminder, 2018 was a 53-week year and thus included an extra week of operations. In today's remarks, we have normalized our fiscal 2018 result to a 52-week year, so that our comments on annual growth rates make for more accurate compares. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, we delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results against what was a backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions and ongoing trade uncertainty. Importantly, we made progress positioning ADI for continued long-term success, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.44 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $1.19. For the full year, revenue was approximately $6 billion, down slightly year-over-year as double-digit growth in our communications market was offset by slower demand across other markets. Specifically, collective revenue from our B2B markets of industrial, communications and automotive increased slightly compared to 2018, led by strong demand across the wireless communication sector. Given the current operating conditions, we continue to actively manage our business, reducing operating expenses. All told, full year adjusted EPS was $5.15. We generated approximately $2 billion in free cash flow. While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is below our long-term operating model, we continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500. ADI is a diverse business across customers, products and applications that positions us to succeed in any macro environment. And in 2019, we added to our cutting-edge technology portfolio through strategic investments, while partnering even closer with our customers. The resiliency of our business model in any economic environment is evidenced by our B2B revenue outperforming the industry in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. And we're not standing still. To that end, let's turn to our priorities for 2020. Priority one is deepening customer centricity. We possess the broadest product portfolio, applications expertise and manufacturing capabilities in high performance signal processing. This enables us to solve our customers' toughest challenges at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. The factors driving customer demand are : first, our customers are facing a scarcity of available analog design engineering talent, and thus, they're increasingly turning to us for that expertise. Second, the challenges our customers face in the third wave of information and communications technology are becoming ever more complex. In this world, digital systems increasingly rely on real-world information to make mission-critical decisions. And the accuracy and the integrity of this information is becoming more important. As a result, our customers are partnering with us more deeply to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product inventions and innovations. We are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling solutions with our comprehensive portfolio of high performance mixed signal, RF and microwave and power management technologies. To that end, as we enter 2020, our opportunity pipeline value is at record levels and increased more than 15% year-over-year. Priority 2 is the efficient use of capital. First, R&D is critical to our company's success. And in 2019, we invested $1.1 billion there. To continue this virtuous cycle of innovation-driven success, we choose our investments wisely and when necessary, pivot quickly, targeting the most attractive opportunities, particularly across our B2B markets. This long-term approach to R&D allows us to continue to innovate and fortifies our position against any economic backdrop. Second, we're extracting value from our acquisitions to complement our R&D and drive long-term value creation. With the Hittite acquisition, we became the market leader in high performance RF with a portfolio that spans DC to 100 gigahertz. Since the acquisition 5 years ago, we've more than doubled Hittite's revenue. And in the last year, our RF franchise revenue increased over 30%, led by industrial and wireless communications growth. The LTC acquisition added high performance power management and precision signal processing to our portfolio, positioning us to provide more fully integrated solutions and capture additional value. Due to the combination with LTC, we're building our power pipeline, which is up nearly 40% over the past year and beginning to deliver new revenue streams. For example, in power, we've won designs across 5G infrastructure, data center and automotive that are moving to low volume production in 2020, ahead of a more meaningful ramp in 2021. This puts us on a path to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead. In addition, we're making steady progress on the next phase of our LTC cost synergies, which Prashanth will elaborate on in just a while. Third, we're committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. Our target is to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. And in 2019, we returned more than 120% of our free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments. Priority 3 is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. And some examples include, for example, in 5G wireless, we're pushing the innovation curve on our market-leading integrated transceiver by adding digital capabilities, algorithms and optimized power solutions. This enables customers to scale channel count by 8x while managing size and thermals. And 5G isn't just about wireless, it will also require a complete re-architecting of the core and wireline network to meet the 5G vision of gigabit speeds, low latency and high reliability demanded by mission-critical applications. This network expansion will require a significant upgrade of the backhaul system, opening a new revenue opportunity for ADI's optical and point-to-point microwave solutions. For electric vehicles, we have the highest performance BMS solution, providing customers with up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. Next in our road map is revolutionizing how monitoring and controlling batteries will be solved, and that is wirelessly. This creates a more accurate, reliable and necessary approach to measurement for the entire battery life from formation to implementation to reuse. With the rise of Industry 4.0, factory floors are becoming more digital, within -- with greater sensing, measuring and actuating activities. In turn, this creates additional demand for our precision-signal-chain franchise as well as extensions to this franchise into new areas. For example, our innovative software IO solution enables greater flexibility across the factory floor, and high performance power is essential to managing heat dissipation as information density increases at the equipment level. However, it's not just about our core technologies, digital factories are also creating new TAM for our suite of connectivity and sensor solutions. And last but not least, in health care, to build upon our strong growth trajectory, we're extending our high-end component franchise with integrated modules, increasing our BOM. We're also extending our signal processing hardware and algorithms into new areas such as glucose meters, surgical instruments and digital health applications that predict and manage chronic disease. So in closing, at the start of this year, I shared the adage with you that a rising tide lifts all boats and that the true test of a company's strategy and business model is its performance during the low tide. Despite the external turmoil, for the full year, we posted approximately 70% gross margins, best-in-class across the semiconductor industry, and almost 41% operating margins, in line with our long-term operating model. As we look ahead, we're hopeful that market demand will improve as early as our second quarter. And in an ever-changing world, we remain focused on being agile and responsive to market dynamics, demonstrating courage in creating and seizing opportunities, showing additional prudence in our investments while driving continuous improvement across every facet of our business. Longer term, the data era is creating an inflection across our industry. I believe that ADI's prospects are extremely compelling as our product portfolio is aligned with favorable secular trends that I believe will provide tailwinds for many years to come. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q4 '19 earnings call. As usual, with the exception of revenue, and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. So let's start with fiscal 2019, which was a solid year for ADI. Revenue finished at $6 billion, down a modest 2%, while our B2B revenue was up slightly despite continued trade and macro uncertainty. As Vince shared, our margins continue to be strong. Gross margins were approximately 70% and operating margins were 40.6%. Adjusted EPS was $5.15. Free cash flow was approximately $2 billion. We repaid $850 million of debt, paid $780 million in dividends and repurchased over $600 million of stock. All told, after debt payments, we returned 120% of free cash flow to our shareholders. So now let's look at the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.44 billion was down 6% year-over-year as flat industrial was offset by broad-based weakness across our other end markets. So I'm going to go through some commentary on the individual markets. Industrial, which represented 52% of revenue in the fourth quarter, was flat year-over-year. Trends were similar to the previous quarter where we saw strength in aerospace and defense, health care and electronic test and measurement offset by weakness across automation and memory test. These fourth quarter application trends were consistent throughout 2019. And for the full year, Industrial revenue decreased 2%. Our Industrial results highlight the benefits of having a diverse product portfolio and tens of thousands of customers across many applications. Communications, which represented 18% of revenue in the fourth quarter, was down 19% year-over-year, with both wireless and wired down double digits. For the full year, comms revenue was up double digits driven by a notable pickup in 5G-related revenue. As we have mentioned, the comms market is inherently lumpy, and we believe this softness is largely timing-based. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, and we remain confident in our expectation that our comms revenue will grow in 2020 and beyond given our market-leading position and higher content opportunity in 5G. Automotive, which represented 16% of revenue in the fourth quarter, was down 8%. While BMS continues to be a bright spot, growing double digits, we did face sour headwinds, which impacted our other application areas. For the full year, auto revenue declined 6%, in line with the decline in vehicle sales. And in total, fourth quarter revenue from our B2B markets decreased 6% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, full year B2B revenue increased slightly. Consumer, which represented 15% of revenue in the quarter, was down 7%. And our performance for the full year was down 16%, in line with our outlook. Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 68.4%, a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially. Approximately 140 basis points of this decline was related to a onetime inventory charge associated with a customer within our Communications market. OpEx, was $427 million, a decrease of more than 5% year-over-year. And sequentially, OpEx was down 2%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of OpEx declines due to our discipline on discretionary spend and lower variable comp. Operating margins were approximately 39%. Excluding the onetime charge, operating margins were above 40%. Interest and other expenses were down $6 million year-over-year as we continue to focus on reducing debt. Our tax rate was 13%, which came in at the lower end of our guide. And all told, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.19, or $1.24 excluding the onetime inventory charge. Now moving on to the balance sheet. Sequentially, inventory dollars decreased $28 million and days declined by 5 to 124 As a reminder, our target for inventory days is 115 to 125. But as we have communicated in the past, ADI is currently in the process of closing 2 legacy LTC facilities. During this transition, we plan to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers. Channel inventory ended the quarter at 8.5 weeks above our 7 to 8 week range. For the fourth quarter, our sell-in revenue was below sell-through. Fourth quarter CapEx was $51 million and for the year was $275 million or approximately 5% of revenue. Looking to 2020, we are forecasting CapEx to be slightly below 4%. And now on to the first quarter outlook for 2020. In our seasonally weaker first quarter, revenue is expected to be $1.3 billion plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to decrease mid-teens year-over-year, and there are a few items factored into this outlook. First, we are planning to meaningfully reduce channel inventory in the first quarter and return to our target range of 7 to 8 weeks by the end of the second quarter. Next, we expect 5G demand to remain modest through the end of this calendar year with a positive inflection in demand to occur in the fiscal second quarter as the global 5G rollout ramps. And lastly, in fiscal 2020, the Chinese New Year falls in the last week of our first quarter. So during this time there is minimal activity across our Chinese distributors. So turning to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Op margin is expected to be approximately 36.7% at the midpoint mainly due to lower revenue and lower utilization. Our non-op expenses are expected to be approximately $49 million. And for fiscal 2020, we are reducing the low end of our long-term tax rate and guiding 12% to 15%. Based on these inputs, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1 plus or minus $0.07. As Vince stated, one of our priorities is the efficient use of capital, and I want to highlight the actions we are taking related to this effort in the current environment. The first action is preserving working capital by managing inventory both on our balance sheet and in the channel. In the fourth quarter, we reduced factory utilization and plan to do so again in the first quarter. To put this in context, our current factory utilization is at levels consistent with prior cycle troughs. The second action is restructuring, in line with our disciplined approach to managing cost and operational efficiency. In the fourth quarter, we executed a restructuring and realignment of our business. This restructuring, combined with the previously announced LTC facility closures, will result in $135 million of total cost savings over the next 2 years. As we exit 2020, we expect to realize approximately $50 million of savings with around 75% coming from OpEx and the balance from cost of goods sold. These cost reductions will begin in the first half. And in 2021, after the facilities are closed, we expect to realize the remaining $85 million of savings in cost of goods sold. Together, these position us to drive operating margins towards the high-end of our long-term operating model over time. And the third action is continuing to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt payments. In 2020, we plan on paying down between $300 million to $500 million of debt. We expect to return all remaining free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So in summary, the external environment will continue to present headwinds at least in the near term. However, as Vince noted, we are seeing early indications of improving conditions beginning in the second quarter. And with that, let me turn it back over to Mike to lead our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Jamie Zakalik : This is Jamie Zakalik on for Vivek. My first question is on gross margins. I know you mentioned that onetime inventory charge. But going forward, how should we think about the sensitivity of gross margins to sales and mix? And is there something else that could impact those? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Great. Thank you for the question, Jamie. So first, let me start by reiterating our model. 70% is our long-term model. And as you saw in the good times, we were operating above that, closer to 72% plus. And in these last 2 quarters -- or last quarter and the current quarter, with some of the revenue compression, we're in the high 80s. So through a cycle, we're still going to see 70s. But the way I kind of guide you to think about it is there are 2 factors, utilization and mix. Mix doesn't change, and given kind of where the outlook is, industrial is going to be above 50%. We have lower utilization in the first quarter, and this is going to impact the per quarter margins and bring us down to that sub-70%. The first quarter does not have the reserve headwinds, but it does have the lower utilization. So on a go-forward basis, what happens is really going to be macro dependent. As volume comes back, we will have pretty significant leverage from where we are. And then on top of that, I just mentioned the additional cost reduction actions that we're taking, $100 million in cost synergies exiting 2021 and roughly kind of $15 million of that will come in by the end of this year. Do you have a follow-up question, Jamie? Jamie Zakalik : Yes. Great. That was helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the 5G comm side of things, you guys gave some great color on timing. But I was just wondering if there was any specific geography or area that was weaker on the comms 5G side? Or if it was more broad-based? Vincent Roche : Yes. Jamie, the downturn -- the short-term downturn here in 5G was broad-based. It was all regions and all customers. Michael Lucarelli : We'll go to our next call -- question. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations on managing through this environment. So first question, if we look at revenue's down 15% year-over-year for the January quarter, how will you qualify that between; a, seasonality; b, lowering channel inventory; and c, weaker end demand? Just trying to understand, between those 3, what's driving the down 15%. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, the outlook is mid-teens on B2B. In that sense, on a year-over-year basis, I would say Industrial does a bit better than mid-teens, maybe down about, say, 10% or so year-over-year, that implies, I would say, worse than seasonal sequential growth. Part of that is demand, part of it also reducing the channel. Automotive, it's right around that mid-teens percent down year-over-year, and comms is down a bunch more in the mid-teens and down sequentially as well. And on Consumer, the math on that implies about 20% or so down year-over-year. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Tore, as a rough estimate, I'd say that, if you took the combination of what we're doing in the channel plus the impact of Chinese New Year, roughly like a $50-ish million impact on a revenue impact to kind of how we're guiding the outlook. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes. That was really helpful. So a follow-up for Vince. Vince, you talked about connectivity now for BMS and including wireless. I assume that is based on a proprietary wireless heart technology? If not, maybe you could elaborate a little bit on that, please? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks for the question, Tore. Yes, so we've got the highest precision battery management, the sensing and measurement portfolio. Now to that, we are beginning to send those wireless technology. It's a proprietary rugged, robust self-healing radio technology. And so yes, it is proprietary based on proprietary ADI hardware as well as software stack. Michael Lucarelli : Can we have our next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : I had a question on distribution inventory, and I'm just confused in the -- why the difference between the disti work-down, the channel work down that your Analog as well as broader diversified guys have seen versus your channel inventory went up the last quarter. And so you're taking the action now. But just wanted to understand why the difference in timing, Vince? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. So just remember that we manage the business on a sell-through basis. We're recording revenue on a sell-in basis. And over the course of 2019, our sell-in was roughly equivalent to sell-through. But as we've seen revenue come down towards the later part of 2019, the levels in the channel have gotten outside of our preferred range of 7 to 8. So we're taking specific action. We began in Q4, we'll continue in Q1 with a goal that, by the end of Q2, we will get channel inventory kind of back in that 7- to 8-week range. The result is that we're going to be putting less into the channel than the channel is selling out. And the answer I gave Jamie earlier is that -- or sorry, Tore earlier, is that roughly, if you include that plus the Chinese New Year impact, which is at the end of our fiscal first quarter, is, at a rough estimate, kind of $50-ish million worth of revenue impact. Michael Lucarelli : And Ambrish, I'll just add one thing that Vince and Prashanth said in their script, our industrial business was only down about 2% last year, which I think, versus the market, was very -- performed very well. So there's always timing and all the different things. But on a performance basis, we outperformed in '18 and again in '19. Do you have a follow-up, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, it did. And this was with respect to the write-down, typically in the analog world, inventory write-down usually then results in a tailwind down the road. But I was wondering, are we seeing something different here? And I'm assuming, it could be a wrong assumption, that this is related to Huawei. So does that come back? And are you able to sell that inventory? Or are we looking at -- we always think of analog as companies with deep moats, which I'm sure you do. But are we seeing a change at Huawei that they're also developing analog parts that go into their infrastructure? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Let me take the first part of that. And I'm going to recap what I said in the prepared comments. We took a $20 million inventory reserve related to a onetime charge for a customer in the comms market. We were building to one forecast and then the demand changed pretty rapidly after they were added to the BIS entity list restriction. So it was our determination that it was the prudent thing to do, and absent another law change, we believe we have minimal to no more inventory exposure for this customer going forward. Is it possible to sell some of that inventory? It's possible but obviously not probable given that we did take the reserve. Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think the second part of your question there was regarding potential competition there in China. So I think it's not a surprise that Chinese customers are going to look for security of supply, they're going to look for alternate sources. But there's nothing to suggest that we're losing designs anywhere. And as you said, the analog market naturally has deep and wide competitive moats given the complexity of the technology, the diversity that's required to be a stable, long-term supplier into those markets. And of course, the life cycles as well are very, very long. So I guess, the way to look at it -- the threat from local players in China, well, it really isn't anything new. But no, there's a lot of other facets of -- that require just beyond the product. The quality levels we ship are in the parts per billion. The support required is very, very sophisticated, very complex. And I think the asymmetry between the skill set and talents that we have as an analog supplier compared to anybody else, that asymmetry is pushing more and more towards ADI. So the gap between the skills that we have and many others, that gap is growing. So I think to just finish up my commentary here on China. It's a -- it has been and will continue to be an important market. And we expect to be doing a thriving business there in the years ahead for many, many, many decades. Michael Lucarelli : Go to our next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Vince and Prashanth, I think you both talked about a potential recovery in demand starting in the fiscal second quarter. Is that -- was that a comment specific to comms? Or was it more broad-based? And I guess more importantly, what gives you the confidence to make those comments given the uncertainty both from a macro and trade standpoint? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Okay. Why don't I start on that and, Vince, any -- if there's anything you want to add. So there's some macro and some kind of specific to ADI. So from a macro level, it's our take that we're kind of bouncing along the bottom. Because certainly, there's ongoing uncertainty with the trade war that's impacting overall demand and customers are putting a pause on CapEx spend. It is weaker than a year ago, but it seems to be stabilizing at this level. For comms and 5G, there is a lull between deployment. As I said in the prepared remarks, comms is inherently lumpy. It's very early days on the 5G, and we're expecting demand to kind of stay soft through the end of this calendar year but pick up nicely for 2020. And as I mentioned in the remarks, we're expecting comms to grow year-over-year in 2020. Specific to ADI, we've got a couple things that are impacting our first quarter. So as I had mentioned, I think we've had a couple questions on this now. We are proactively reducing inventory in the channel and then, on top of that, the Chinese New Year, which is normally a nonevent if it falls in the middle of a quarter, this time is falling at the end of our fiscal first quarter. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think the only other thing I'd add to what Prashanth has said is that, typically, our first quarter is weaker than our second. There is a seasonality to that. Particularly in the Industrial and the Automotive businesses. And that's how we see things shaping up at this point in time. And as Prashanth just said, we're confidence that 5G demand is really poised to ramp at the beginning of our second quarter. So I think that's the summary of demand here for you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Toshi, do you have a follow-up? Toshiya Hari : I do. And then Prashanth, you talked about $135 million in cost reductions over the next, I suppose, 2 years. How should we think about that number kind of sticking to the P&L? In other words, should we expect a pretty high percentage drop through to margins? Or should we expect you guys to reinvest some of the savings in your priority areas? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Toshi. Let me break that down again. So we had talked about $100 million of cost savings when we closed down the 2 facilities. And then in addition to that, we made some -- we took some actions in the fourth quarter to generate an additional $35 million. So those actions are in process. In 2020, we would expect to exit the year with about $50 million of those savings in the run rate, and that will be split between OpEx and cost of goods sold. We'll have those savings sort of feather in over the course of the year. That is, at this point, kind of roughly a net number. So that is -- the expectation is we're going to be able to drive most of that down through the P&L and into the EPS number. Michael Lucarelli : We can go to our next question. Operator : Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. William Stein : And I want to address the optimistic April commentary. By my math, I think normal seasonality in April's about up 3%. And it sounds like the real recovering end market is comms infrastructure-related to 5G. I'm wondering if there's any insight into other end markets. And if normal seasonality is up 3%, do you think we wind up posting meaningfully better than that? And any -- it would seem an outside possibility that we could be up year-over-year in that quarter, but any comments would be helpful. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Will. I'll sort of give you some basis of seasonality. We don't guide outside of a quarter, I would say. We did give you some context around comms being a growth market for us in 2020 despite the slow start. Seasonally speaking, Industrial in 2Q is up, call it, 5% to 10% sequentially. Automotive, I'll probably call it 5% to 10% maybe sequentially. So both those seasonally are up. We don't have visibility into those orders today. But seasonally standpoint, they do -- there is some tailwinds to those businesses. And Communications, we're talking about a pretty big uptick in Q2, which helps drive that business to grow for 2020. Do you have a follow-up? William Stein : Sure. Any comment as to where we are in the comms, and -- pardon me, the Consumer end market. We know there was this force touch design win that's been sort of fading from the model, you've declined this year. Maybe an outlook as to the coming year in that end market would be helpful, both in that sort of one charismatic design win and then maybe the core business. Vincent Roche : Yes. So my sense during 2020 is that we will have a continuing headwind. It's lasting a little bit longer than we initially thought. But -- so I think 2020, we expect it to be down in the range of 10% to 15%. And it relates really to the ongoing mix issue in our portable business. But what I'd like to report to you is that I believe, overall, that 2020 will mark the bottom for this business. The diversity of our products, across products, across customers and applications is stronger than we've seen actually for several years. And so based on that diversity and the strength of our pipeline and diversity of our pipeline, that gives me the optimism that we're going to get back into a pretty solid growth trajectory, I think, in the 2021 and beyond period. Michael Lucarelli : We'll go to our next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Christopher Caso : My question's on the automotive market. And I think your comments were that it's looking down 6% year-on-year this year in line with industry units. I presume you're still gaining some content there. So is the difference there inventory that's come down? And perhaps you could -- if that's the case, what's the setup as we go into 2020 as perhaps some of that inventory normalizes? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Let's do this in 2 parts. I'll kind of lay out how we're thinking about our auto performance 2019 and then let Vince talk about a bit more on the growth drivers. So to -- as a recap, our fourth quarter was down 8% for the full year and -- sorry, our fourth quarter was down 8%, the full year was down 6% year-over-year in line with SAAR. And we saw that across all applications on the year-over-year decline except for BMS, which continues to show very strong double-digit growth. As we look to 2020, I'll let Vince kind of talk about the outlook for auto 2020 and beyond. Vincent Roche : Yes. So during the past year, we've grown our pipeline of designs at -- across the globe with all the key automotive customers. And I think one of the areas that I'm pleased -- most pleased about is in our power portfolio, which cuts across all the various sub application areas in automotive. I'll give you a couple of examples. We've won an integrated power management solution for a market-leading Tier 1 radar platform. We're the key reference design at a market-leading [ vision ] camera supplier. And given the strength of our infotainment business as well in DSP and audio signal processing solutions, we've been able to bring more power management from the OTC portfolio into that particular suite of applications as well. We've talked before about our A2B and -- our A2B solution. So today, that only represents kind of low -- very low single digits of our auto portfolio. But the design pipeline is gaining robustness. At this point in time, we've got design wins at around 14 OEMs, and half of them are currently in production. So my sense is that, over the next 3 years, we can double the size of our A2B business. And also the other facet of A2B is that the TAM for it is expanding into being able to participate in active noise cancellation and power delivery. Prashanth has touched on the BMS side of things. So that will continue to be, we believe, a strong growth driver for the company, probably up around double digits in 2020. And on the autonomous vehicle side of things, we're sampling a CMOS-based radar solution that doubles the dynamic range against anything else that's out there from our competitors. So I think we have some very, very good innovation drivers in the business as well as the fact that we are bringing the OTC portfolio into many, many new accounts in new geographies. So hopefully, that gives you a sense for what's going on in the auto sector. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Chris. Do you have a follow-up? Christopher Caso : I do. The follow-up question will be on production. You talked about being at cycle trough utilization rates. What would be the plan going forward if you did see some of these indications of improvement going into the second quarter? Would the plan be to start increasing production at that point? And generally, how are you looking to manage inventory as you go through next year with an understanding that you're going to be keeping some of that bridge inventory for the fab closures? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Right. Yes. Thanks, Chris. So yes, so the -- I guess, the way to think about it is utilizations are -- we're comfortable utilizations are at trough levels, so as -- and you can see the impact of that on our gross margins. So as the demand comes back and revenue improves, then we'll have great leverage from an internal manufacturing on being able to capture that demand with new manufacturing. And then in addition to that, we mentioned we're taking the channel down. So there will also be likely some opportunity to provide product into the channel to meet that growth. So we're setting ourselves up for what we believe is a good trough in Q1, and then we'll grow from here. Michael Lucarelli : And Cheryl, we'll move to our last question, please. Operator : Our last question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Harsh Kumar : Thanks for managing the business extremely well and actually taking actions to get better profitability. I had one on gross margin. So all things put together, based on what you've said, we should think about gross margins for the January quarter, take the 140 bps charge that you had. Prashanth, is that a good way to think about it and down maybe 50, 60 basis points? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I think maybe you're saying the same thing, Harsh, but we're going to -- we're essentially going to swap the inventory charge with the underutilization. So that's probably how you should think about gross margin for the first quarter is we don't have the recurring inventory charge, but we do have the headwind from kind of trough factory utilization levels as we kind of bottom out in the first quarter. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Harsh? Harsh Kumar : Yes, please. And then just real quickly, in the auto business next year, do you think with all that's happened this year with the [ flushing ] of production and SAAR being down mid- to high -- 6% to 7%. Do you think we're at a point where we can basically say that Automotive for ADI will grow next year on a year-over-year basis? Vincent Roche : Well, it's very, very hard in what has been a very uncertain environment in automotive over the last several quarters. Very, very hard to call. I think if SAAR stabilizes, my sense is that we'll have a normal year. And for the last 5 years, we've been outgrowing SAAR. So my expectation is that if SAAR stabilizes, given the length of the product life cycles of our legacy business as well as the new designs we have, that the business should behave normally, we should have growth [ SAAR ]. So one of the things as well that we've got -- I think we've mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, is that our power business is poised given the design wins that we've got across infotainment and safety systems, in particular, we expect for the year here to gain momentum and start to show meaningful revenue in the 2021 period. Michael Lucarelli : And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all of available reconciliation and information can also be found there. Have a happy Thanksgiving, and thank you, again.

And welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.  I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl. And good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2020 conference call.  With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today about ADI's first quarter fiscal 2020 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from their prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.  And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. While our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, as you'll have seen, importantly, we managed our operating costs and working capital effectively to position ourselves to deliver margin expansion in the quarters ahead.  Before I discuss the quarterly highlights, I'd like to address the coronavirus outbreak. First and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of those affected and, of course, our employees. We're doing everything we can to provide our customers with the support they need to minimize disruption to their businesses. While the situation remains fluid, we are monitoring it closely. Prashanth will expand on the financial implications in just a while.  So now on to the first quarter. Revenue was $1.3 billion, down versus the prior year, but in line with our expectations. Operating margin was approximately 37%, a decline versus last year due to lower revenue and our decision to lower utilization. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.03, above the midpoint of guidance. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 35% free cash flow margin, and this continues to place us in the top 10% of the S&P 500.  On our call last quarter, we shared our priorities for 2020, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress so far. Priority 1 is the efficient use of our capital. The first call on our capital is funding new product development activities. In the first quarter, we invested over $250 million in R&D, with more than 90% of this spend targeting the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. For example, an area of increased focus for ADI is our power franchise. Here, we've been increasing R&D to enhance our strong position in the broad market and to extend into new opportunities across areas like data center, automotive and 5G infrastructure. Our power design win momentum remains strong, and we expect to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead of us. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders and we just announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend. Priority 2 is deepening customer centricity. As I've shared before, the combination of our broad product portfolio, domain expertise and manufacturing capabilities sets ADI apart. We're always anticipating the technology needs of our customers and engaging with them early in order to solve their toughest challenges.  And I'd like to share just a few examples specific to our automotive segment with you now. Our A2B platform continues to gain traction in the cabin electronics ecosystem. By leveraging our platform portfolio, we're opening up new applications for our customers such as active noise cancellation. In the quarter, Hyundai became the 14th auto manufacturer to incorporate our A2B technology. And together, we announced the industry's first all-digital road noise cancellation system. With the rise of active noise cancellation, we're creating stickier customer relationships due to the integration of our hardware and software capabilities while increasing our SAM per vehicle.  There's also a lot of intensity and urgency in OEMs moving towards electric powertrains. We were an early player in the market, partnering with industry leaders to improve the efficiency of the battery in electric vehicles. As a result, our BMS solutions are delivering greater miles per charge and monitoring battery health more accurately. In the U.S. electric vehicle market, we're benefiting from near-term strength as customers ramp production, and new design wins across future models will help us to deliver on our long-term objective of growing BMS revenue at a double-digit rate.  Priority 3 is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. We've previously discussed with you key secular trends across our company such as 5G, electric vehicles, factory automation and data center. Now today I'd like to spend some time on the space market, perhaps a more obscure subsegment of our industrial sector. Our space customers' challenges are not just around RF, signal processing and power management. Space solutions must also perform under extreme cosmic radiation and conditions of high temperatures. We solve these challenges through the combination of our comprehensive product portfolio and the passive knowledge base built over many decades of serving this market. While space represents a couple of percent of ADI's total revenue today, it commands stellar margins, and we see potential to double the business over the next 5 years.  Now let me share a little more with you about why this sector is exciting to us. The space market is rapidly evolving. Over the last decade, unprecedented levels of capital have gravitated towards this vertical, thereby increasing the number of privately funded space companies by 20x. Therefore, new technologies and capabilities are emerging that are leading to new opportunities for ADI. This includes the advent of low Earth orbit or LEO communication satellites. These satellites are becoming the new frontier in space with forecasts suggesting that by 2020, over 20,000 will be in orbit, up from just hundreds today.  To provide some context, LEO satellites differ from today's geostationary or geo satellites. Technologically, they provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, which enable real-time communication. Operationally, they continuously change their position relative to the earth and only stay connected with a given terminal for approximately 10 minutes. As a result, the number of terrestrial terminals that communicate with these satellites, whether they're on the ground or in the air, will grow into the millions with the proliferation of LEO satellites. To succeed in creating this network, both satellites and terminals must be capable of being steered. But so this requires an exponential increase in channel count enabled through phased array antennas, an architecture that is used in 5G networks already today. And as you can imagine, more channels packed into smaller form factors is increasing thermal and power hurdles. To help solve the engineering challenges of creating this ubiquitous and always-connected LEO network, our customers are increasingly turning to ADI, looking to us to not only be a supplier, but indeed, a key system architect. So we're engaging with customers early in their design process to develop end-to-end solutions from antenna to bits, combined with power capabilities, to deliver the required performance and, of course, robustness. Our ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of space-grade solutions across the entire analog spectrum from RF and signal chain to power is unique. And this cannot be completely replicated by any of our competitors, making ADI the go-to supplier for our traditional OEMs as well as the next wave of disruptors. All told, we see the LEO communications satellite plan becoming at least 4x the size of geo over the next 5 years. And with LEO's shorter refresh cycle compared to today's satellites, we expect our space business to deliver a steadier stream of revenue in the years ahead. In summary, space has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver and unlock value across other verticals as well. Once fully operational, these LEO networks will provide real-time, reliable high-speed connections globally, ushering in opportunities from autonomous driving to telesurgery.  So in closing, and speaking broadly about ADI, I believe demand for our solutions will be unprecedented as technological innovation underpinned by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity continues to grow rapidly. And as I look ahead, I believe we're very well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and, indeed, strong shareholder returns.  So with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.  ADI delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue came in line with our outlook as we meaningfully reduced channel inventory. And through our disciplined spending, operating margin and EPS were above the midpoint of guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.62, an increase of 15%, the high end of our target range of 7% to 15%.  The dividend is the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy, and this represents the 17th increase over the last 16 years. These consistent increases reflect our commitment to strong shareholder returns as well as our optimism about the long-term prospects for our business.  Before getting into the income statement, let me first cover the end markets. In line with our expectations, our first quarter B2B revenue declined 15% year-over-year as better-than-expected industrial demand was balanced by softer communications activity. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, declined 7% year-over-year. As we forecasted, most applications within this highly diversified business declined, while aerospace and defense once again grew double digits year-over-year.  Communications, which represents 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 31% year-over-year as wireless and wired both declined. While communications is an inherently lumpy market, our position has never been stronger or more balanced across the ecosystem. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, which we continue to expect will be a multiyear tailwind.  Our auto business, which represented 16% of revenues during the quarter, declined 16% year-over-year due to weakness across all applications. As Vince highlighted, we remain confident in auto due to our strong pipeline of customer wins, especially in our infotainment platform and our market-leading BMS position. And lastly, consumer, which represents 13% of revenue during the first quarter, declined 20% due to portable applications. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment. Now on to the P&L. Gross margin came in at 68.5%, up slightly sequentially and down 180 basis points year-over-year as favorable mix was offset by lower utilization. As a reminder, fab utilization was near trough levels this quarter in order to reduce our balance sheet and our channel inventories. OpEx in the quarter was $412 million, down 4% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. In light of the softer revenue environment, we've curtailed spending and have delivered sequential OpEx declines in each of the past 5 quarters. As a reminder, we plan to exit fiscal 2020 with $50 million of annualized savings across cost of goods sold and OpEx.  Operating margin finished at approximately 37%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $47 million, down $3 million sequentially and $9 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. All told, first quarter adjusted EPS came in above the midpoint of guide at $1.03. Now moving on to the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory was reduced by about $20 million or 4% sequentially. Despite this reduction, our inventory days increased to 133 due to the lower level of revenue. Recall that our target for inventory days is 115 to 125. But during the process of closing 2 legacy LTC facilities, we do expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers. We also reduced channel inventory by approximately $40 million in the first quarter and plan to reduce channel inventory in the second quarter again but to a lesser degree. CapEx in the quarter was $55 million or about 4% of revenue, and we expect to end fiscal 2020 slightly below our 4% long-term target. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $2 billion or a free cash flow margin of about 35%. Over this period, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. We paid approximately $200 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million of our stock in the first quarter. We still plan to pay down between $300 million to $500 million of debt in fiscal 2020.  Now we'll provide some context on our recent business trends and our current view on the coronavirus. In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remained relatively resilient into the second quarter. However, unsurprisingly, we have begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China demand for industrial, automotive and consumer is minimal for all of February before returning to a more normal level in the last 2 months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout. So while forecasting business dynamics in China is very difficult today, our guidance reflects our best estimates.  So looking ahead to Q2, revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This includes an approximately $70 million revenue reduction due to the near-term risks with -- associated with the coronavirus. And as I said earlier, we expect to reduce channel inventory again but to a much lesser degree than in the first quarter. At the midpoint of $1.35 billion, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase mid- to high single digits sequentially with growth across all of our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications.  Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be up sequentially to approximately 37.5%. We are planning for our tax rate to be between 10% and 12% for the quarter, and we are improving our fiscal 2020 outlook to between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.08. While we are mindful of the uncertainty around this, I echo Vince's optimism. We are encouraged by near-term trends that point to a stabilization and improvement across end markets, and we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.  Let me give it back to Mike now to start our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. Michael Lucarelli : [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Jamie Zakalik : This is Jamie Zakalik on for Vivek. So similar to peers, you guys noted some stabilizing and improving trends in end markets in the January quarter, but it seems that growth has actually decelerated across all the end markets. So I guess are the improving trends more in the -- in February, even with a lot of these virus headwinds? And is it specific to any end market or geography? Or is it more broad-based? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. So Jamie, I think the first quarter was in line with what we expected. So there was deceleration going into the first quarter. Now remember that in this quarter, we undershipped the channel. And as I said in my prepared comments, we undershipped by $40 million. So on a revenue rec basis, PO ship-in was $40 million below sell-through. As we go into the second quarter, orders were improving over the course of the first quarter, and we expect that to continue into the second quarter with this note that we made on disruption in China where we believe some of this demand is going to get pushed out to future quarters. So I do think that our view here is that we've sort of bottomed out and it gets better from here through subsequent quarters. Vincent Roche : Yes. Maybe I can add a little bit of color as well from a market perspective on that. So what we're seeing is -- in spite of what looks like a delayed 5G employment -- deployment in China, in the second quarter, we're expecting growth, actually quite good growth, in our communications 5G sector as well as wireline. And that growth is becoming a little more broad-based. We're seeing, I would say, green shoots in the factory automation and process control side of things as well, which is a significant part of ADI's industrial business, and also gathering strength in the ATE sector. And from an automotive standpoint, we're seeing particular strength in our business in America as well as Europe at this point in time. Operator : And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Vince, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more there on 5G. You said it's becoming a more broad-based business. Just trying to understand geographically where the growth is coming from, because, obviously, it's not coming from China near term. So if you could elaborate on that, that'd be great. Vincent Roche : Well, I think, Tore, China has taken a pause. Asia is still, at this point in time, in terms of deployments today, Asia is by far the strongest in 5G. I think what we're seeing is the -- probably a faster roll off in 4G than we had anticipated. 5G has taken a bit of a pause in China but is set -- based on what we see in terms of demand, is set for a ramp during the second quarter. And also, I pointed out that wireline for ADI in general, whether it's data center, whether it's metro or long-haul networks, is doing quite well. So as we've come into the second quarter, our book-to-bill has been -- is well above 1, and that gives us the confidence in the growing strength of that business through the second quarter here. Michael Lucarelli : Tore, do you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Just a quick one. Prashanth, you did a good job lowering channel inventory. It sounds like you're going to lower a bit more again this quarter. Could you maybe give us some targets either by weeks or what dollar amount are you trying to lower than buy? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Well, I think, Tore, we had mentioned in the -- in our first quarter -- or fourth quarter call that our goal was to get back to our target range by the end of the second quarter. It may take us a little bit longer now given we didn't include the impact of the coronavirus in the top line. So we're still heading towards the same channel inventory target that we'd had before but with a bit of a softer top line. I think it might actually be end of third quarter before we're back in range. Operator : Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Your automotive business was down 16% in the quarter, which was in line with your guidance. But relative to peers, a little worse on a year-over-year basis. Vince and Prashanth, you guys talked about your optimism around some of the design win activities in BMS and infotainment. But in the near term, what's driving kind of the double-digit decline in your automotive business? Is that mostly channel inventory reduction? Or are you losing share? I guess, more importantly, how are you guys thinking about kind of the through-cycle growth rate for your automotive business over the next couple of years? Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, look, we have been very, very clear. The 2 growth drivers for ADI in the automotive sector are the infotainment area, A2B, active noise cancellation, audio signal processing in general. And of course, BMS has been, over the last couple of years, a double-digit growth driver for ADI. I think in the quarter just passed, BMS, which has a route -- a strong route in China, suffered as a result of the virus. And -- but when we look into the second quarter, we expect our -- as I said, our second quarter has better trends in North America and Europe. So we're expecting modest growth in the second quarter.  The headwind for ADI has really been the safety sector where our 24-gigahertz radar technology is declining, probably at a rate a little faster than I had expected. And also in the area of MEMS, more of the kind of the passive safety MEMS where we withdrew investment 3 or 4 years ago. So I think we'll begin to bottom out, I think, on those headwinds, specific to safety. We have a new safety modality in 77 gigahertz, which is, by all accounts, very, very exciting for our customers. We will see bottoming, I think, of the MEMS and the 24-gigahertz radar decline.  So my sense is in the areas we've picked of powertrain, infotainment, we're very, very well positioned to grow those sectors over the next 2, 3, 4 years. Operator : And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Prashanth, I had a question on the actual weeks of channel inventory, and I might have missed it, but did you give an actual number? I think you were 8.5 weeks in the prior quarter. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: We did not give a number, Ambrish. The -- what I mentioned is we took the channel inventory down $40 million. But if you do the math, we're still going to be above our target range because the revenue -- the numerator has moved, but the denominator has also shrunk. So on a ratio standpoint, the weeks are still high, but we did take a big chunk out, and we're going to take more out in Q2, as we mentioned. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : I did. Vince, maybe for you. In 2 areas, real quick on industrials. What's the right way to think about, given what's going on in China and broader, how to think about return to growth in the industrials business? You guys outperformed last year, but what -- how should we think about year-over-year growth returning? And then in comms, we always ask you about wireless. I had a slightly different question. How is -- how are you guys positioned in wireline versus if you look back at 2, 3 years ago? And then what gets you excited about the design wins in -- that should be ramping out in wireline? Vincent Roche : Thanks, Ambrish. Let me try and address the industrial question first. So we are seeing our aerospace and defense business continue to grow at double-digit rates annually. We are seeing, as I said a little earlier on, the factory automation side of things outside of Asia is on, I'd say, a solid improvement in its demand pattern. I think inventory hangover has largely been taken out of the equation in the industrial sector.  So I think when you look -- when we look at the impact of the virus in China, we're not expecting really anything in the industrial sector in terms of shipments there for the month of February. But all that said, we're -- we have a very solid book-to-bill in the industrial sector, and we will get, I think, a decent increase in our top line in industrial during the second quarter.  On the wireline side of things, our game there is really 2 pieces. We have a very strong -- we have a strong leadership position in optical control systems for data centers. So all of the FANGs, for example, would use our technology in their data centers for control of the optical signal chain and also the cable market, we have a good position there in infrastructure systems. So wireline business has been growing high single digits now for several years, and I don't see any decline in that. I think that will be a decent growth driver for ADI. It runs into the region of $400 million annually in terms of sales at the present time. So I view that very much, Ambrish, as a tailwind for the company. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Let me also add on the industrial side, we did take down general inventory meaningfully. A lot of that relates to industrial. And if you look at industrial, you kind of zoom out and you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, we're only down low single digits, which is a pretty good performance in a tough macro backdrop, and that goes to the diversity of that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : Great quarter. But I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. I think you guys have done a very good job now kind of talking about your capital allocation, but what I'm having a hard time understanding is kind of the margin mix here. I realize that space and satellite is probably higher margin. I'm guessing like 80%, 90% gross margin. You guys are actually coming down a bit on the gross margin line. Can you maybe talk us through what the gross margin profile should look like in the first half and the second half? And then how that would flow through the operating margin line as well? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mitch. So I guess, a little bit of background, right? Our model is 70% gross margins sort of long-term model. And in good times, we were operating at 72%. In more challenging times, like now, we're down in the high 60s. So through the cycle, 70%. As we move forward from here, we see 2 things that are going to be impacting margins, both utilization and mix.  So Q1 represented the trough level of our utilization expectations for the year. So a fair amount of under absorption in our internal manufacturing facilities, that gets better from here on, and that will be tailwind to margins. And also as some of the questions that were asked, Vince mentioned the strength in industrial. We expect industrial to continue to be growing as we move forward. And industrial, in general, is one of our highest margin businesses, so that will also provide tailwind.  So we -- I would expect that you could see sequential improvement in gross margins through the balance of this year likely getting back to our model margins in the second half, maybe towards the end of the year. Mitch Steves : Okay. That's very helpful. And then I just have one follow-up. Just in terms of the seasonality for the business. I think maybe you should probably be taking a little bit of a more conservative view in April just because it sounds like China is going to open up March 1. But when I look at the July quarter going from April to July, should that be, I guess, above seasonal, given that April is depressed from all the macro items that are going on? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: All right. So the guide for our second quarter included a $70 million adjustment that we made at the top for the impact of the coronavirus. And the math that we use to arrive at that is we essentially zeroed out February in China for industrial and auto and consumer, and then we also made an adjustment for communications being pushed -- or the deployment of 5G being pushed out a bit just because of the labor challenges that are going on there. We expect that to begin unwinding in the subsequent months and certainly be back to normal in the third quarter.  Could it be above normal? That's certainly a possibility. It depends on the timing of how that $70 million comes back. It's our current view that, that is purely a timing shift that, that is not lock demand. But as to when that falls back in, it's hard to say, but the order activity certainly suggests that it's not going away. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : I wanted to zero in first on comm. So it sounds like you're pushing it out. Your prior guidance for comm last year was for it to grow year-over-year, and it feels like you're backing away from that. But the trajectory in the second half on the old guidance was for very strong sequential growth kind of every quarter going forward. How should we be thinking about the trajectory of comm in the second half, I guess, given, I guess, the bump in Q2 versus the profile that was -- that you had in mind 3 months ago when you gave guidance? Do you still expect to see a similar ramp maybe just off a lower base? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. So I guess a few things, Stacy. For the first quarter, a little bit lower than we expected, mainly due to the 5G pause that started in the second half of '19. Moving into the second quarter, orders have begun to come back in very much as we expected, and our book-to-bill is above 1. So that's supporting a strong sequential increase in second quarter for both 5G, but also as Vince mentioned, we're seeing some good strength in wireline as has been reported by a number of peers as well.  The sequential increase is below our initial expectations because of the -- a lot of that was related to 5G timing in China. So I think everything is moving a little bit to the right here. So it's hard for us to say at this point whether the timing of that recovery is still going to put us up year-on-year, but I think we'll have to see how quickly this demand recovers and whether the installations happen as -- is it caught up in the year or not? But we feel very good that this is really a dislocation of demand versus actual loss or destruction. Vincent Roche : Yes. I'd say one other comment on that, Stacy. Our optimism about what's happening in America relating to 5G has strengthened over the past quarter as well. So yes, we have the disruption in China. It's really a delay of demand rather than destruction. But my own sense is that we probably see more activity at the back end of the year in the U.S. relating to 5G. Michael Lucarelli : Do you have a follow-up Stacy? Stacy Rasgon : I do. So it sounds like also, even though we have the delay because of coronavirus in China, that the order patterns still seem to be very strong. How do we think about the strength of those Chinese orders in relation to potential increases in sanctions that we've been hearing about? Do you feel like there's any sort of scramble on the part of Chinese customers to get out in front of those sanctions? I guess what are you seeing in terms of customer behavior in relation to the regulatory? Vincent Roche : Yes. I think, first off, when you look at the geopolitical machinations, it's actually very hard to figure out what's going on. So -- but I think with our business in general, we have many thousands of customers in China, many thousands of product SKUs, and we see ongoing demand. There are obviously areas where we are restricted, particularly in 5G, but I think the rest of our business right now is in a kind of a normalized market and regulatory situation.  So the demand we're seeing is -- despite the disruption here because of the virus, the demand in China is actually quite strong across the board otherwise. Stacy Rasgon : Let me rephrase the question. If, all of a sudden, like the de minimis threshold gets dropped from 25% to 10% and the foreign direct products will get strengthened, and they put more stuff on the controllers, does that impact how you guys view the trajectory in China as we go through the year? Would you have to reevaluate what you can ship and what you can't? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Well, yes, we would have to reevaluate. But remember that we have adjusted one large communications customer down from traditional mid-single to low single-digit as a percentage of revenue. So that is kind of -- that's the limit of our exposure depending on what happens to that particular customer. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think it very much depends on the scope of what happens. And so far, everything we've seen is relating to one specific area of communication. So unknown, Stacy, but we'll see. Time will tell. Operator : And our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Just wanted to follow on the comments about the opportunity to double Linear's growth in the coming years. And Prashanth, if you could talk about -- I know there's some gross margin levers as you consolidate manufacturing and just kind of how you're viewing on that in terms of the growth profile versus kind of margins for Linear in the next couple of years. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure, sure. So I'll take the margin side of it. And then in terms of doubling the growth, I'll let Vince comment. On the margin side of it, we have talked about the focus we've got on shutting down 2 facilities. We've taken -- we've made announcements on those. We've actually been able to accelerate some of the savings for the -- for one of the factory closures, so we're going to start seeing some of that benefit in cost of goods sale at the end of this year. But the balance of that $100 million, we see feathering in over 2021. And as we've stated in the Q4 earnings call, our intention is to let -- to kind of let all of that come through the bottom line. So we are not -- we're not looking to redeploy that cost of goods savings. So you should see some lift in our gross margins on an ongoing basis as we exit 2020 and through 2021.  In terms of kind of the progress we're making to double that Linear growth rate, let me hand that off to Vince. Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think we're making good progress, Craig, in trying to equalize the value of the kind of legacy ADI mixed-signal technology value in a given application with power. So we're looking for equivalents. For every dollar of mixed signal, we expect to get $1 of power. And that's what the market opportunity available is.  I can tell you that our pipeline for the LTC portfolio, specifically power, is up about 40% actually year-over-year. And we're moving into production down the automotive sector, the communication wireless sector. Wired, we're in early volume production as well. So we expect to see those areas ramp in terms of meaningful impact on the top line during 2021. And there are many, many, many new sockets in the industrial area that we're working on. So that will just take a little longer given the slower uptake in terms of turning design-ins to revenue.  But I think a lot like Hittite. We feel -- we went through this process with Hittite. We've doubled the size of that company, that franchise over the last 5 years. And I think we're on a very good track right now with LTE to achieving 200, 300 basis points of top line growth based on the strength of the portfolio and the activity at the customer level that we're seeing. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good to see the fundamentals starting to improve here. A&D grew greater than 20% last year. Defense budget was approved beginning of this year. It's strong, up 4% versus last year. It's -- and you guys expect double-digit -- continued double-digit year-over-year growth here this year in A&D. Is most of the strength coming from the defense segment? Or are there also programs in the commercial aerospace SATCOM sector that are starting to fire as well? Vincent Roche : Yes. As I said in the prepared remarks, obviously, defense budgets are in our favor in terms of buying technology and deploying it. So we're in good shape there. And yes, we're seeing strong double-digit growth in the space area as well. And that's relatively -- we've had a good position there. But the -- if you like, the explosion in the launch of LEO satellites and geo satellites is really increasing demand for the company. And we're looking at, in these applications, many thousands of dollars of content per satellite kind of thing. So we're very optimistic about that, but it's a combination of both. Both parts of that business are really growing well. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Harlan, I would say, remember, think about defense as when DoD gives the money to the primes and the primes start deploying it, this is going into design decisions that were made many years ago. So we're enjoying the flow of that larger budget into the primes. And then to us, for decisions that were made some time ago, we still have quite a bit of great design activity that has yet to be funded. So that's on to come.  On the aerospace side, it's holding as well as can be expected given the environment that's going on there. And then in space, as Vince mentioned, space is really in front of us, that growth is in front of us. So while ADEF has been growing at a nice clip and continues to, we feel even more optimistic about what's in front of us coming both from space and future design win activity that's happened for the defense business. Operator : And our last question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. William Stein : 2 of them, really. First, I'm hoping you can provide some update or commentary as to the competitive situation and maybe the legal competitive situation with an FPGA supplier in high-performance converters, maybe competitive trends as to design win traction relative to that vendor. Vincent Roche : Well, broadly speaking, in terms of competition, we are -- we've outgrown our closest competitors for the last 3 years. And so we're clearly gaining share across the board in communications and industrial, in particular. So I think competitively, we're in good shape. I think pricing is very, very stable as well. So I think, overall, legacy is strong. Our design pipeline is strong. And we're excited about the new R&D programs as well that are coming to fruition for the company. In relation to the litigation with, as you said, a large FPGA company, we will give you -- as new information emerges, we'll be transparent with you, and we'll communicate with you. But at this point, all I can say is that we're confident that this matter is going through the court and will be successfully resolved. And we are defending our IP very aggressively, and we believe we have a very, very strong case. So that's where it is. It's within the courts, but we're very optimistic with how things are going. Michael Lucarelli : You said you had a follow-up, Will? William Stein : Yes. I appreciate that. Just on the COVID impact. It sounds like what you're saying is that you're assuming certain orders are 0 for February. Given we're February 19th, I assume that's actually what you're seeing in the order book. Is there any anticipation for weakness later in the quarter? And also, any supply disruption that you're noticing at all? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. So on the orders, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it is very hard to kind of size the activity of what's going on in China. So when we arrived at our $70 million, we wanted to give the investor and analyst community what assumptions are we using, knowing that these are very dynamic. So for our assumptions, we've taken our China activity to 0 in February and pushed out a little bit of 5G. The -- on the supply chain side, we are not seeing much disruption at this standpoint. We had some of our back-end suppliers early on. We're struggling just with getting some labor in to run their activity, but that's also been resolved as time has settled out here. So from our standpoint, our supply chain -- and we just revalidated this with the guys this morning. Our supply chain, we feel good about. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Will. I'll also add, I think it might be helpful, given your question, kind of given our outlook of B2B, what we think each market is going to do because there seems a little bit of confusion out there of how we think the market is going to do. We think each market grows sequentially. We said, in total, B2B will be up mid- to high single digits. I will rank order those on priority, I'd say comms is a little better than that, industrial does in line with the overall outlook, and auto does a little bit worse. So that kind of helps you think of how the -- sorry, how the corona is impacting our business. And with that, thank you, everyone, for joining us. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all available reconciliations and information can also be found on the quarterly results section of our website. Thanks again for joining us and the continued interest in Analog Devices. Operator : And this concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019] (sic) Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com Now onto the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including the uncertainty regarding the duration of COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, our customers and suppliers and the global economy and also those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all from Boston. I hope that you and your families are all staying safe and healthy during this period. First, we want to express our gratitude to the health-care workers and the many other heroes on the frontlines who are protecting the health and the well-being of our communities. Thank you also very, very much. When we had our last earnings call in mid-February, we were just beginning to understand the depths of the COVID-19 impact in China and since then the pandemic has had a profound impact on the world putting tremendous stress on society and of course the global economy. To counterbalance this, we've seen an unprecedented response from governments with the deployment of fiscal and monetary policies to soften the downturn and restart economic activity whenever that may be. While our sector is not immune to the turbulent operating environment it's my belief that technology will be what mollifies the current weakness and drives new demand and business models post pandemic. That's not to say that we're standing still. We've taken actions to curtail spending and reinforce our cash position. And we are learning from this challenging period and adapting quickly while still investing to ensure that we are well-positioned in the recovery and for the long term. Our team has embraced the challenges with many of our employees working from home, but obviously not everyone can work remotely and I want to acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees. We've continued to perform at exceptional levels and deliver for our customers. For these employees supporting our clinical operations, we've implemented safeguards to protect them, including more PPE, increasing social distancing and enhanced sanitization. And we provided them with additional incentives and benefits to allow for continuity during this very difficult time. Our team has also done an excellent job staying close to our customers. We moved quickly to pivot manufacturing lines and prioritize our healthcare solutions that are needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has allowed us to expedite supply used in products such as ventilators, respirators, imaging systems and patient monitors to our healthcare customers, and I'm incredibly proud of the resourcefulness and commitment that we have shown in rising to this critical challenge. Additionally, through the ADI Foundation, we've made multi-million dollar donations to support both global and local pandemic response efforts, but our work goes beyond financial contributions. We are also partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions such as rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical grade patient monitoring that leverage our technologies. So now I'd like to discuss the current operating environment a bit. Given the reach and depth of the current crisis, global business activity has been disrupted, and today we have seen a deterioration in demand within our automotive, broad-based industrial, and consumer businesses. However, our business is proving more resilient than during the global financial crisis. To that end, healthcare demand is at record levels and communications demand is robust across wireless and indeed wireline sectors. We're also seeing strength in portions of our industrial instrumentation business and steadiness in our defense business. Now this success is no accident. Through our organic investments and acquisitions of Hittite and LTC, ADI is a very different company than we were a decade ago with more diversity, a broader portfolio across High-Performance Analog, Power and RF and higher exposure to more profitable and durable end markets. So now let me move to the other side of the equation and talk a little bit about supply. Across the world, supply chains were disrupted when many governments ordered shelter-in-place mandates and closed their borders. For ADI, capacity was reduced at our back-end test and assembly sites in mid-March across the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore. Once granted essential status, we acted quickly yet responsibly to ensure employee safety and improve our capacity. And today, I'm glad to say we're operating at normal capacity levels. This demonstrates the agility of our global operations and the dedication of ADI's employees around the world. Despite the fluid and uncertain demand and supply environment, we delivered revenue of 1.32 billion and EPS of $1.08. This was in line with the original range we provided on our first quarter earnings call underscoring the resiliency and flexibility of our business model in any economic backdrop. Now as we've mobilized to preserve ADI strength in the near-term we're capitalizing on the many opportunities we see to fortify and expand our market position for the long-term. Our team remains focused on our three strategic priorities. So let me provide you with a brief update on each. First is the efficient use of capital. Importantly, ADI has ample financial liquidity to meet the needs of our business across critical investments, dividend payments and servicing our debt. Despite the current macro environment, we've generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 32% of sales over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Throughout our 55-year history, we've encountered and navigated several Black Swan events successfully by taking a disciplined and balanced approach to financial management. Specifically, the first call on our capital is funding new product development. This means investing smartly in both our people and technologies to ensure we continue to deliver disruptive innovation. In the quarter just passed, we invested 19% of revenue in R&D, spending 95% on the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. We also remain committed to strong shareholder returns with our dividend as the cornerstone. In the quarter, we returned over $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So let me turn to our second priority, which is about maximizing customer impact. We are continuously innovating to stay ahead of customer needs and while COVID-19 has brought new challenges it has also revealed new opportunities in a reordered world. During the quarter, our customer engagement didn't slow down. We hosted hundreds of virtual seminars with thousands of customers in attendance, training them on new solutions and new technologies. These interactions were very productive. We saw increased design activity on new product development across markets and customers. For example, we partnered with a key electric vehicle customer to re-imagine how audio is rendered across their fleet. As a result of this increased and focused collaboration, we added our high performance audio digital signal processors to our A2B platform, more than doubling our content per vehicle. And in our instrumentation test business for data center compute, we continue to work with customers on reducing their system complexity and getting to market faster. Our innovative solutions combine our analog mixed-signal and power micro-module portfolios. These solutions deliver four times the channel density, while simultaneously increasing throughput. While these are just two examples, there are many more across all of our markets. It's this current flurry of design activity that positions ADI to accelerate post pandemic.  Our third priority is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. While every downturn has its own unique characteristics, they all seem to have one thing in common that is they drive tremendous change. Industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever and new industries are emerging focused on the physical and cyber. ADI where the data is born is at the center of these exciting secular growth opportunities. And I wanted to share some thoughts with you today. As I noted earlier, our healthcare business is providing several of the technologies that are critical to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Taking a step back, ADI has been committed to this market for many years, as we anticipated the opportunity for innovation to deliver better patient outcomes. Now this crisis will challenge us to rethink and hopefully fast track the accessibility, affordability and wellness focus of global healthcare. To achieve this, healthcare systems are going to need to be upgraded and clinical grade patient monitoring will need to be extended from the hospital right down to the patient's home. Massive adoption of sensing, computing, and cloud capabilities is going to be required. And we believe that ADI Technologies will be at the forefront of this transformation. The communications market is moving at a rapid pace to keep up with the strains put on bandwidth and latency, as more people work remotely, transact business more digitally, and consume media from everywhere. Here ADI is playing a critical role in building out the infrastructure required from an always connected world. Our integrated transceiver, power, and optical control portfolios are enabling customers to economically scale their investments to build the next-generation networks. We continue to innovate to meet future performance, size, and power needs positioning us to gain share to capture additional value. Another secular trend we're benefiting from is the rise of Industry 4.0. While this trend isn't so new, the pandemic is moving it to the forefront of our customers' needs. It's clear that post-pandemic supply chains will be re-imagined and new ones will be built, ones that are more flexible, automated, and perhaps sovereign. To solve the economic burden that comes with this, customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factory floors and the increased use of robots, cobots and analytics. This creates additional demand for our precision signal chain and power franchises and extends ADI into new areas like software IO, depth sensing, condition-based monitoring, and robust connectivity. Outside of these secular growth trends, I'm also personally inspired by the tremendous sustainability benefits that we've seen in a short amount of time. For example, we've seen sizable decreases in carbon-dioxide, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide. I believe that ADI and the industry at large can and should be leveraging its creative brainpower to be better stewards of the planet. We recently published our comprehensive corporate responsibility report entitled Engineering Good. And I can assure you, there will be more to come as I'm deeply committed to ADI's leadership here. So, in closing, the shape of the economic recovery is still very, very uncertain and dependent on many variables. While we're confident in our outlook provided today. This unprecedented macro backdrop will continue to influence supply and demand dynamics for some time to come. We are embracing the short-term challenges and by leveraging the collective power of our talents, our technology and customer engagements, I'm very confident we will emerge stronger. So, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release. Back in March, we would do our guidance for the second quarter as the spread of COVID created an enormous amount of uncertainty and impacted our supply chain. However, we acted quickly and decisively and I'm pleased to say that our second quarter results were within our original guidance with revenue of 1.32 billion, operating margin of 38%, and EPS of $1.08. Without those capacity limitations, we believe revenue would have been above our original midpoint provided at our first quarter earnings or approximately $50 million higher. So let's get into the market results. Our B2B markets while very volatile intra-quarter due to COVID-19 performed relatively in line with our expectations. B2B revenue increased 3% sequentially. And if not for supply constraints we would have delivered on our outlook of growing mid to high single-digits sequentially. Notably, we achieved these results, while reducing channel inventory by 60 million in the quarter. Industrial, which represented 54% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 4% sequentially, and declined 8% year-over-year. While we experienced broad-based weakness across most applications, our healthcare memory test and energy verticals all grew from the year ago period. Communications, which accounted for 21% of revenue, finished up 15% sequentially and given the tough compare decreased 24% year-over-year with weakness across both wireless and wired. This market is and will remain lumpy, but over the long-term will be a high growth market for ADI, given our positioning in 5G and optical control systems. Automotive, which represented 14% of revenue, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year with declines across all major applications. Not surprisingly our auto business was impacted by lower vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production. As many customers were required to suspend their operations in response to COVID-19. Lastly consumer, which represented 11% of revenue was down 14% sequentially, and 5% year-over-year, as lower consumer spending impacted both portables and prosumer. Notably, we continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer sector. Let's go to the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin came in at 67.7% down both sequentially and year-over-year related to low utilizations from reduced production levels and the factory closures I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we expect to realize 100 million of cost of goods savings exiting fiscal 2021 through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. OpEx was 390 million, down 5% sequentially marking the sixth consecutive quarter of declines. This was driven by a combination of the quick aggressive measures we took in response to pandemic as well as our continued focus on cost management. Operating margin finished at 38% up over 100 basis points sequentially and down year-over-year. Non-GAAP expenses were 49 million, up sequentially, but down over 10 million compared to last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11% and all told second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $1.08. So now let's go to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we proactively bolstered our strong liquidity position. We retired a $300 million bond and subsequently raised $400 million from the semiconductor industry's first ever green bond. And as a cautionary measure, we also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway through the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately 800 million of cash and about 5.6 in total debt. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.9 times on a trailing 12 month basis. Between cash on our balance sheet and the commitments under our revolving credit facility, ADI has more than 2 billion of liquidity easily eclipsing our annual dividend payment and the debt due in January of 2021. Inventory was essentially flat from the first quarter. However, days of inventory fell to 126 from 133. Our sell-in revenue was well below our sell-through revenue at distributors. As I mentioned, we reduced channel inventory by about 60 million in the second quarter. This brings our total channel reduction to around 100 million in the first half of fiscal 2020. Channel inventory currently sits comfortably at the low end of our seven to eight week range. So finishing on cash flow for the quarter, cash flow from ops was 429 million and CapEx was 60 million. We expect CapEx to decline meaningfully in the second half and finished the year below our normal target range of 4% of revenue. In the quarter, ADI paid approximately 230 million in dividends and repurchased 114 million of our stock. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at 1.8 billion or 32% of revenue. Over this period, we reduced debt by roughly 400 million and returned around 830 million to shareholders via dividends and an additional 500 million via repurchases. As a reminder, our capital return policy is to return all free cash flow after debt reduction to shareholders. In fiscal 2020, we expect to reduce debt by 300 million to 500 million and return 100% of the remaining free cash flow. Before moving to our outlook, I want to highlight what we are seeing in terms of demand and supply. As Vince mentioned earlier, our business is performing quite well under the current macro backdrop. Healthcare is very strong and we expect this strength to persist into the back half of the year. We are seeing robust demand in communications across both wireless from 5G deployments and wireline from data center and networking upgrades. This strength is benefiting our industrial instrumentation business where we sell high performance solutions used in both memory and 5G testing. And lastly defense is typically a steady business against all economic backdrop. All told, these markets represent almost half of ADI's revenue over the last year. From a supply standpoint, we enter our fiscal third quarter at normal capacity levels. This is quite remarkable and I want to echo Vince's appreciation for the dedicated manufacturing teams across the world. And that brings us to our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially at 1.32 billion plus or minus 70 million, which is a wider range than usual to account for the uncertain environment. This outlook includes approximately 50 million of revenue that was pushed from second quarter due to capacity constraints. We are assuming no change in channel inventory in this plan. We anticipate robust sequential growth in comms, modest sequential declines in industrial and consumer, and a sharp sequential decline in automotive. All told, B2B should increase slightly sequentially and decline just under 10% year-over-year. We anticipate op margins to be approximately 38.3 plus or minus 150 bps. We're planning for the tax rate in the quarter to be between 12% and 13% and based on these inputs adjusted EPS is expected to be a $1.08 plus or minus $0.11. As Vince said, we are confident in our third quarter outlook, but we are mindful of the tremendous uncertainty around us. Our operating model is to plan conservatively and execute aggressively to preserve free cash flow in the near-term. At the same time, we remain focused on the long-term, continuing to invest to capture and create value across several exciting secular growth areas. Let me pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Okay. Thank you, Prashanth. Now let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we'll give you an opportunity for a follow-up questions. Cheryl, can we have our first question please. Operator : Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the solid results, given the backdrop. Vince, I guess, the question I'm getting this morning from investors is just relative to your July quarter guidance. Most of your peers have been guiding anywhere from 10 to 15 percentage points below seasonal. You guys are guiding about five percentage points below seasonal. And I guess the question that's being asked is, to what extent are you just not being as conservative as your peers. To what extent are there some idiosyncratic drivers. Could you help us parse that out? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, John. So I think first and foremost. We've seen tremendous strength in our healthcare business over the last quarter and we expect that will also continue. And also generally speaking with virtualized commerce, work from home, we're seeing again very, very strong demand for the communications products. The optical cable portfolios of ADI are doing particularly well and of course 5G especially in China and Asia, the 5G build-out is moving at pace. So what we're seeing, what we are predicting looking ahead is based on the order streams that we've seen and whatever - what others are predicting. We feel comfortable based on the strength in the areas I've just mentioned. Our defense business continues - continues quite strong. Also businesses attached to let's say the build-out of data centers and cloud like advanced instrumentation test systems for memory, storage and so on and so forth are also doing particularly well. So the overall industrial business holds in there. As Prashanth said, we probably see a modest decline, a seasonal decline in the third quarter. So overall they are the drivers. And as Prashanth said we expect a steep decline in the automotive business, but when you look at the puts and takes that's how we see the quarter shaping up. John Pitzer : That's helpful, Vince. And then just maybe - go ahead Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I was going to give a little bit more background on kind of the orders and outlook, which may help investors as to why our guide came in where it is. So very quickly kind of as expected Feb was weak, March came back very strong largely driven by China, but also some pretty strong demand outside from customer concerns and then it began to correct. So April was soft, continued into May. We finished with kind of book-to-bill above 1.0 in all of our markets except auto. So as we thought about the outlook - we've built our outlook on the expectation that orders are going to continue to slow through the quarter or best case stabilize. The guide that we have out there is built on a 100% backlog coverage, which is much higher than we would normally use when we were at this point in the quarter. We're working terms with our customers and we are enforcing them pretty stringently, so any customers or disty orders are non-cancellable within a 35-day window unless we agree to grant an exception. So that's helping to kind of clean through the backlog and limit order cancellations. So all-in, I think, the assumptions are reasonable given the amount of uncertainty and we did put a little bit wider range on there plus or minus 70 to reflect the uncertainty. John Pitzer : That's great color, guys. And then Vince just as my follow-up. As you mentioned in your prepared comments, the concept of Industry 4.0 has been around for a while, but it does seem like COVID has the potential of actually shining a spotlight on that in a way that we have. And I guess in my mind that probably also helps the 5G build-out because it's hard to have an intelligent factory floor without that 5G backbone, but I was hoping maybe you could help us define that market opportunity for you. When you look at sort of the intelligent factory floor, what percent of your industrial business is it today, and how should we think about potential growth rate three to five years out, if this really starts to accelerate? Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a good question, John. I would say today what we would consider to be Industry 4.0 with a highly cloud connected industrial sector is quite small. I think today it's probably less than 10% of the total installations of factory automation and process control systems, but the intelligence we're getting from many of our customers now is that there are two things driving the need for the redeployment of industry. So it's probably three things. One, the need for them to understand how to gather and utilize data analytics to improve the outcomes for their customers. So that assumes automatically that you deploy 5G, you deploy optical connectivity, many forms of shorter robust connectivity. I think also the - we are seeing the fragility of the supply chain globally. And customers are telling us they're expecting to bring more machine capability into managing the supply chain. And I think thirdly is the regionalization or the [suburbanization] [ph] of supply chains and we can see the pressures there globally. And not to mention the demographics, many of the societies that are producing lots of capital goods and consumer good outputs like Germany, China and as America begins to regionalize supply chain, we're likely to see the adoption of cobotics and more robotics technologies in general. So I think there's a long way to go, John. We're in the early innings of the Industrial 4.0, the adoption of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Thank you and congratulations on the results. First question is for Vince. Vince, you talked quite a bit about sort of investing in this time frame and you highlighted, again, medical and industrial. What about the automotive market, are you seeing sort of a secular change there, are you still investing or will you still be investing as heavily in automotive going forward. Vincent Roche : Well, we've actually been ramping, Tore, our investments in automotive, particularly, in the infotainment, the power side of things and also the electrification of the vehicle, the electric powertrain. So right now it's a very, very hard market to read both in terms of demand and of course supply. I think automotive has been extremely hard hit by the closures globally. So we see, I would say, the two areas of most interest to us Tore are the infotainment, the car experience, leveraging for example, our A2B technology, our heritage and digital signal processing and audio signal processing in general adding for example active noise cancellation to the portfolio and we're deploying that, starting to deploy that now. So I think the whole Infotainment side of things is an important part of the go-ahead and that's a place where we've a lot of heritage and we're actually increasing investment. We just acquired a company actually during the quarter to enable us to bring more signal processing to the audio space. In the electric vehicle area, I think, it's got a long, long road ahead of it. As the electrification today the powertrain the - as a portion of overall car sales only about one certainly less than 2% of total car sales. So a long, long way to go. And that's an area where we have strong position. We're on our fourth or fifth generation of technology node product delivery to that sector. So I'd say in those areas we are actually increasing investments. Power is another area, the cross-connective power into our business particularly in Europe and the US. That's an important initiative and we're seeing some very good green shoots there in terms of early stage production of designs - of power designs that we've attached to the signal processing portfolio. I think it's also true to say, Tore, that probably on the safety side of things, we've been decreasing our investments over the last several years, partly in MEMS. You'll recall three, four years ago. We withdrew most of our investments in that area. So I would say safety is more opportunistic, infotainment and electric powertrain more strategic. Michael Lucarelli : And, Tore, do you have follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes, that was very helpful. A follow-up for Prashanth. Prashanth, I do realize obviously right now the orders are kind of all over the place. But if we start to see deterioration, what would be the company's playbook especially on things like manufacturing utilization inventory because it seems like some of your peers have different playbooks. Just wondering what ADI's playbook will be in response to potentially weaker or continuous weaker orders? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure, yes. So, Tore, let's do that in two pieces. First, think about how we manage our cost. So, right, in the near-term how we think about cost and you've seen it in the OpEx results already. We have a variable comp structure that is intended to act as a shock absorber and that unwinds as revenue falls. On the discretionary side, we've already proven hiring. We've essentially got travel at zero. We've exited consultants and any discretionary contractors and perhaps most impactful is we've deferred our merit increase, which is usually 2%, 3% year-over-year. We are on track to realize about 35 million of synergies that we announced last year in November. And we still have $100 million of cost synergies that will come through by the end of 2021. So there are some more permanent actions that we can take. And we have taken in the past such as furloughing employees until demand returns. We did this back in 2008, 2009. We would certainly put activities like temporary actions on the table. So there are all items that we'll think about. On the manufacturing side I would emphasize that our utilizations are fairly low right now. So we're kind of at the trough levels. Inventories are we feel at a good position. So I don't think we have kind of the same inventory exposure that we would have had at the same time last year. We've reduced on the balance sheet as well as in the channel. So, overall, I think we're well positioned if this breaks up or should it break down. Maybe Vincent you want to talk a bit more about kind of longer term. Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think, Tore, we feel good about the stability, the diversity and stability of our business and what the profit margins we generate as a company. We're investing to make sure we come out of this trough, a stronger company both in terms of product development as well as customer engagement. So we also believe very strongly in the persistence and the pervasiveness of our technologies. So I believe that the story for ADI get stronger with the tailwinds that we have and the portfolio that we have for the future. So look, overall, our goal is to take advantage of the disarray. And while - I think Prashanth said in his prepared remarks we're preparing for the worst, but we're executing aggressively for the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good execution. I'm curious, Vince, what in the communications segment just near term. Did you see any level of pull-in from China or Huawei in either April our July and then as we get beyond the current environment, do you see any further impact from all the restrictions on Huawei or do you think that share will be shifted over to Huawei's competitors. So longer term you can start to regrow your communication segment? Vincent Roche : Well, Vivek, let me answer the second part of your question first. So we have tremendous coverage. We've got very strong market share across all the providers all the OEMs of - for 5G across the globe. So irrespective, I mean, the networks are going to get built. And whoever builds and will be using our stuff, our transceiver technologies, our microwave portfolios, many, many other ancillary analog technologies. And so I feel good about the position that we're in. If share shifts from one to the other we will pick it up. And so the - yes in terms of demand, I would say, we have reconciled. So it's pretty clear what the carriers are saying about the deployment of 5G globally right now. Our reconciliation in terms of how we balance the demand of the carriers is with - it is very tightly tied to our supply. So we have a good sense for what the carriers are looking for and that's how we're planning essentially the factory loadings to support this particular area. So I don't think I mean you asked about are we seeing double ordering and so on and so forth. What is characteristic in the base station infrastructure market over many, many years is that get gyrations when a set of contracts are coming due. You see some level of, I would say, core need and a certain amount of redundancy built in, but it's pretty typical. What we're seeing right now in terms of 5G is no different. What we've seen in terms of the dynamics how 4G operated in terms of demand. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I'll remember on the call, what we said publicly about that large customer in China. A year ago we talked about them being a mid single-digit customer. They've been reduced meaningfully since that time. They're more around the low single-digit percent of sales today. And as we look forward to our third quarter and beyond, we don't see that changing from there. Do you have a follow-up? Vivek Arya : Yes. Very helpful. Thank you. On gross margins, how should we think about the trajectory from here given all the puts and takes of mix and I think Prashant you mentioned fab under-utilization, but then you also mentioned some of the cost synergies. So let's assume sales stay at similar levels even going into your Q4 what can gross margins do then? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Yes, good question, Vivek. So our model is 70% long-term and you saw that in good times we can get upto 72% plus and in more challenging times like now we're sort of in the high '60s. So through and through a cycle, we can average 70%. Getting to 70% is very macro dependent as demand gets better, we are going to get utilization tailwind. We have, as I mentioned, utilizations are near trough levels now. We have - what we have in our favor is an additional 100 million of costs of good synergies. So that should begin to give some tailwind as well to our gross margins. And then as 2021 returned to kind of growth numbers then I feel that - it's reasonable for us to kind of get back to that 70% level. Michael Lucarelli : Cheryl on the call - on the interest of time, we're going to go to one question per caller to get through a bit more. Operator : And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ambrish Srivastava : Prashant, I had a question for you on a couple of quick ones, OpEx trajectory. How should we be thinking about it? And then on capital allocation, is it fair to assume that given all the volatility that share buybacks stays paused for now? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So for OpEx we are in our sixth quarter of consecutive improvement in OpEx. Some of that was - is clearly actively managing the spend levels down. But some of it is also the result of this COVID situation where travel is at a freeze. I think it's reasonable to expect that as businesses reopen and customer expectations start to change and we need to get back in front of folks that some of that is going to climb and as well as some other discretionary spend will come back in. So I wouldn't run this level of OpEx out too long, but I think you've seen that we have been incredibly diligent with managing our OpEx over the last year and a half and that's a muscle that ADI has built and we're not going to let that go. In terms of how to think about the capital allocation. Our framework really hasn't changed. The first call is to invest in the business and you know whether that is organic or inorganic. And then after that it's really 100% return of free cash flow after debt repayments. So the plan for 2020, we increased the dividend by 15%. We're still intending to reduce debt by 300 million to 500 million in this fiscal year and then everything after that goes back to shareholders either through dividend or share repo. So I would expect that we would be - if the business holds out that we would be reactivating the share repo in the coming quarters. Michael Lucarelli : We'll go to our next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ross Seymore : Congrats on the strong results in challenging times. I just wanted to go back to the automotive side. You said it would be down sharply. So just a couple of questions on that. Do you mean sequentially year-over-year or both and given the timing of when the auto factories have been shut down and then are turning back on. How are you viewing the shape of that recovery and how much of that turning back on dynamic influences your thoughts for both your July guide and your October outlook conceptually? Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks for the question, Ross. So I think first and foremost we expect sequential and annual declines. It is extremely hard to read the automotive sector right now. I think it's easier to predict how factories will reopen and how supply will happen. I think the bigger question is what is going to happen with demand. And I think the way we view it is that we don't understand the pace of reopenings right now and at what level of utilization or capacity will they operate. So I would say we think it will be tough going for the remainder of this year in automotive. And perhaps we'll start to see a recovery in the first half of the coming year. So that's how we're viewing it. So the area that we feel kind of most conviction around in terms of demand will be for electric vehicles where our portfolio is making very strong headway, which was originally centered really in China into Europe and of course America as well. So very, very hard to read, I would say, but my sense is that remainder of this year will be tough and we start to see off a pretty poultry bottom I think some recovery in the first half of '21. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And Ross, I would say, that is reflected in our guide. We're relatively bearish on automotive in our guidance. Michael Lucarelli : Cheryl, we'll have our next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Good morning and congrats on the strong results. Vince, I wanted to ask about your BMS business specifically. How did that business trend in the quarter? What's the outlook into July? And if you can give us an update on customer traction with your wireless BMS solution into the back half of the year and potentially into fiscal year 2021, that would be helpful? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes, so overall in the quarter just gone, we saw a modest decline, I would say, in our BMS revenues, but our design and hit rates are very, very strong. We're set to - at the present time we have somewhere in the region of 40% to 45% market share in BMS. And we believe that share will grow above 50% given the design pipeline that we have and the commitments that we have from customers across the globe. As I mentioned in the previous - the previous answer there. We managed to take what was a very channel-centric BMS business. We've been taking it across the globe and that's for essentially the non-wireless set of things. The wireless battery. We are expecting to see our first production of that particular product happen in the kind of I think the second half of 2021. So that's how we see it. We are in a great position I think right now in North America, China and we're also beginning to penetrate Japan and Europe, I think, is in the early stages of adoption at any kind of meaningful level and I feel good about where we are there. So and our portfolio is highly differentiated. There are many pretenders out there, but when it comes to optimizing the miles per charge we got more than 20% gain in that - along that metric. So overall it's a 1% to 2% penetration of the car sector. It will probably go to 25% over the next five, 10 years and we're in a very, very good position to see the tailwinds from that as time plays out here. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Toshiya. We'll go to our last question, please. Operator : And our last question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Danely : I guess more of a clarification and a question. So you mentioned that you've seen a little bit of weakness in the April May bookings. Does the guide take into account further weakening in the bookings i.e. did you build any cushion or are you assuming stability from here on out? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, so I think we feel good about our guide, Chris. We don't put a guide out there that we don't think we can based on what we know today we can get to orders were down in April. May was at a slower pace. Our expectation in the guide is that orders continue to slow through the quarter or best case might stabilize. We've got good coverage from the backlog more than we normally do. So we're prepared for some cancellations or push outs because we would have. We always have some turns business in there. We're trying to control those cancellations or push outs, as I mentioned, by being be pretty tough on the terms that we have for direct or disty customers and we've also assumed that the channel is relatively flat inventory levels sequentially. So we think we've calibrated the guide as best as we can knowing what we know today. Operator : Thank you. And I'll turn the call back for closing comments. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website investor.analog.com and you also find our recently published ESG report, engineering good there as well. Thanks again for joining us and your continued interest in Analog Devices. Stay healthy. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release you can find relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements including statements relating to our objectives, outlook, and the proposed Maxim transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release our most recent 10-Q and other periodic reports and materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude special items. Comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks very much Mike and good morning to you all. I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time. So, I'll start my remarks today on our quarterly results and the current operating environment before providing you with an update on our priorities. This includes additional insight of course into our recently announced acquisition of Maxim Integrated. ADI executed exceptionally well in the third quarter despite the highly uncertain environment. Demand was resilient surpassing our expectations leading to stronger than expected results. We saw continued strength in communications across both wireless and wireline applications, healthcare saw record demand, and other parts of our industrial portfolio such as instrumentation tests also performed well. Unsurprisingly, the main area of weakness was automotive driven by global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales. Turning to supply, we're operating at normal capacity which helped us clear backlog and bring supply and demand into a better balance. Our team delivered third quarter results above the midpoint of our revised guide with revenue at $1.46 billion and EPS at $1.36. B2B revenue was flat year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially and both gross and operating margins returned within the range of our financial model at 70% and 42% respectively. We also generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. These results further underscore the strength and flexibility of our business model against any economic backdrop and I'm proud of how the ADI team continues to deliver for our customers. Now, I'll turn to an update on our strategic priorities. We're focused on spending our capital efficiently and the first call is funding new product development. During the quarter, we invested approximately $260 million in R&D with more than 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This continued reinvestment in our business is leading to excellent customer engagements and let me provide you now with a couple of examples. In our communications business, we announced the collaboration with Intel to create a flexible radio platform that will enable customers to scale their 5G networks more quickly and more economically. The high-performance ORAN compliance solution leverages our market-leading software-defined transceiver technologies. This positions ADI to expand our market leadership. In automotive, our new road noise canceling solution is gaining traction. Since announcing our initial win with Hyundai in February, we've added five more customers including the North American leader in electric vehicles. This innovative solution reduces the car weights by almost 100 pounds and energy requirements by about 3%, while potentially doubling our content opportunity per vehicle. We're seeing great design momentum across our diversified industrial market also. For example, in factory automation, customers are rethinking supply chains to make them more flexible with faster response times. And to quicken the pace of adoption, we have formed an alliance of partners to develop an open source architecture. I'm excited to announce a Fortune 500 health care customer is teaming with ADI to help upgrade its manufacturing capabilities, using more connected robotics, thereby doubling our addressable market. And in space, we have design wins going to production this year with traditional aerospace companies and new emerging disruptors that enable the proliferation of next-generation communication satellites. These satellites continuously change their position to earth and require space grade phased array and beam forming technology to create an uninterrupted connection. And we're using this strong position in RF to attach power technologies thereby increasing our addressable market by one-third. ADI also remains committed to strong shareholder returns. This quarter, we returned approximately $230 million through dividends. Recall, that we paused share buybacks due to the pandemic. This has helped us further solidify our balance sheet with a cash balance of more than $1 billion. At this point, I'd be remiss to not discuss our M&A strategy in the light of the Maxim acquisition. ADI selectively uses M&A to expand both our scale and our scope in order to better address the future needs of our customers and deliver sustainable profitable growth. And while cost synergies are an important element in evaluating any acquisition from our perspective, the most compelling benefits come from combining technology portfolios to capture new addressable markets and drive on term revenue synergies. This revenue takes time to realize given the nature of the Analog business, but our products deliver recurring revenue streams and cash flow for decades. Therefore, we strive to achieve our return objective within approximately five years. This time frame, allows us to not only achieve the stated cost savings, but also begin to capture the early revenue synergies. And I think the acquisition of LTC illustrates the benefits of our strategy. Our top priorities there were harmonizing the two organizations to create an entity that is better than the sum of its parts. To that end, I'm proud to say that we've retained and invested in LTC's exceptional engineering talent. Together, we've created an exciting road map of high-performance analog and power solutions combined. We're exceeding our original $150 million cost synergy target and we're on track to realize the next $100 million exiting fiscal '21. And from a revenue perspective, we've more than doubled our pipeline value and we have over $500 million of lifetime revenue coming to market this year, increasing our confidence in doubling LTC's historical growth rate. With LTC complete, we pursued the acquisition of Maxim to strengthen our leadership in the analog industry, better positioning ADI to capitalize on secular growth trends. Over the last five years, Maxim has shifted its business strategy to focus on B2B markets, while enhancing profitability. As a result, Maxim has increased its B2B revenue mix to approximately 80% of total from 55%, expanded its gross margins by more than 500 basis points and increased its free cash flow margin by over 600 basis points during this period. Combined, we're confident we will continue to improve Maxim's performance. This will be driven by our cadre of engineering talent, complementary technologies and breadth of market applications that I'd like to expand on a little here. The cultures of ADI and Maxim are very aligned. Both companies share a commitment to innovation and engineering excellence. With a combined team of more than 10,000 engineers and $1.5 billion of annual R&D investment, we will continue to be the destination for the world's best analog talent. And with three times the field technical resources, we'll be better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers, who have an increased need for application and design support. In the area of power management, Maxim's application-focused offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. Together we will have a more comprehensive power portfolio with approximately $2 billion of revenue. This is particularly important, as power is the largest and fastest-growing Analog subsegment and with increasing design complexity and the need for better efficiency, the system power challenges that our customers must overcome continue to rise and rise. In automotive, Maxim has one of the premier franchisees increasing revenue at a mid-teens rate over the last five years. They're a leader in high-speed data connectivity for cameras, radars and processors with serial link technology, while ADI is a leader in audio solutions with our A2B platform and both companies are well positioned in vehicle electrification, enabling us to better address automakers' EV requirements, which continuously evolve. Together, we will capture more of the increasing system content per vehicle and enable a better experience for the consumer. Taking a step back, the combined company will have unique positioning with 85% exposure to highly profitable long life B2B markets. Maxim's strengths in the automotive and data center markets will complement ADI's strengths across the industrial, communications and digital health care markets. Additionally, the combined company will have increased financial strength. We expect the combination to be accretive to adjusted EPS within 18 months post-close with targeted cost synergies of $275 million by the end of the second year. We also expect to maintain an industry-leading financial profile. As always, we are committed to generating robust free cash flow and our goal is to reach the high end of our margin range of 40%. With our lower leverage ratio at close, we'll also have the opportunity to deliver enhanced cash returns to our shareholders. And I believe that together we can grow revenue at mid-single-digits, due to our alignment with important secular growth trends, such as Industry 4.0, digital health care, next-generation communication systems and vehicle electrification as examples. So in closing, we're seeing promising evidence that a broad-based recovery is underway. However, we recognize that the recovery is highly dependent on the future impacts of the pandemic. We've used this unprecedented time to better align our organization and investments into the most important areas. We believe we'll emerge stronger and are better positioned to drive profitable growth. And as I've shared today, we're very excited about the combination with Maxim, which will drive the next wave of disruptive innovation and deliver significant benefits for all stakeholders. And with that I'll turn it over to Prashanth to go through the financial details and outlook. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. When we provided quarterly guidance in May, we were facing tremendous uncertainty just returning to normal capacity levels and experiencing volatile demand patterns across end markets. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand that resulted in less cancellations and higher-than-anticipated backlog conversion. With that as context, our results came in above the midpoint of our revised outlook with revenue of $1.46 billion, operating margins over 42% and EPS of $1.36. Let me start now with the end market color. Our B2B revenue was up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year, as strength across industrial and communications offset a sharp decline in automotive. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 3% year-over-year. We experienced robust growth in health care, instrumentation test and energy applications. This strength was moderated by weaker trends across our broad market and automation businesses. Communications, which accounted for 25% of revenue, achieved a record quarter. Revenue finished up 14% year-over-year, driven by double-digit increases across both wireless and wireline. This strength came from our leadership position in 5G wireless systems and our solid position in optical connectivity used in carrier networks and data centers.  Automotive, which represented 11% of revenue decreased 29% year-over-year with all applications declining due to global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales. And while no business is immune to the current environment, our BMS and A2B solutions fared quite well. BMS revenue increased sequentially and was down just modestly year-over-year due to our strong penetration across the ecosystem and increasing consumer preference for electric vehicles. And given the continued adoption of our A2B audio platform, A2B revenue has increased over 70% year-to-date despite lower vehicle sales. Consumer which also represented 11% of revenue was down 13% year-over-year. Relatively flat portable revenue was more than offset by double-digit declines in prosumer due to the pandemic-related softness. We continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer business.  In addition to the end market commentary, we wanted to provide some insight by geography as we believe it is helpful to investors in this current climate. Most geographies declined year-over-year. We saw double-digit declines in Europe and Japan, while the decline in North America was less pronounced. The rest of Asia increased and China increased double digits year-over-year largely driven by the robust growth in communications given our solid position as well as strength in industrial.  Now moving on to the P&L. Gross margins returned to our model at approximately 70% down modestly year-over-year from lower fab utilization. We've accelerated the planned LTC factory closings and have started to realize these benefits in the third quarter. We expect additional savings in the fourth quarter and we'll exit fiscal 2020 with nearly half of the $100 million savings in our run rate.  OpEx was $402 million up 3% sequentially yet down 8% year-over-year. We maintained a focus on controlling expenses, which included a one-week global shutdown during the quarter. OP margins finished at 42.3%, the highest level since the third quarter of 2018. Non-op expenses were $46 million down $3 million sequentially and more than $10 million year-over-year driven by lower levels of debt and lower interest rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11.5% and all told, third quarter EPS came in at $1.36.  Now moving on to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with over $1 billion of cash and about $5.6 billion in total debt. This resulted in a leverage ratio of 1.8 times on a trailing 12-month basis. Inventory dollars increased $22 million sequentially, but declined year-over-year. Days of inventory remained basically unchanged at 125. Channel inventory remains lean and is below the low end of our seven- to eight-week target range.  Cash from operations was $557 million and CapEx was only $21 million as we proactively reduced CapEx spend in the current environment. This resulted in free cash flow of $536 million up 8% year-over-year. Our long-term CapEx target remains the same at approximately 4% of sales. And as Vince mentioned, on a trailing 12, we generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow. Over the same period, we've returned around $860 million to shareholders via dividends and additional $410 million via buybacks. This equates to a free cash flow return after debt reduction of nearly 80%, which is below our 100% return target as we paused our buyback program.  Now I'd like to expand on Vince's commentary and discuss how our combination with Maxim will further enhance our financial profile. At deal announcement, ADI and Maxim had a combined pro forma leverage ratio of 1.2 times, which will decrease between today and deal close. The main driver being Maxim which is in cash accumulation phase. They will pay one more quarterly dividend before suspending it for four quarters and their buyback is on pause. Said another way, all the cash generation for the 12 months beginning in the second quarter of their fiscal 2021 will be added to the balance sheet. And for reference, over a trailing 12-month period, Maxim generated $730 million of free cash flow. ADI plans to continue to pay and grow our dividend. And as I mentioned earlier, our buyback program was paused during the height of COVID-19 and will remain on hold for now. When circumstances permit, our intention is to reinstate the program, which has nearly $2 billion remaining under authorization. Also, as we previously outlined, we plan on repaying $300 million to $500 million of debt in 2020. This quarter, we intend to honor that commitment by retiring our $450 million January 2021 note. This will save $13 million of annual interest expense. We believe the stronger balance sheet provides us with flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent buybacks and targeted acquisitions. And now on to the fourth quarter outlook. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $1.44 billion plus or minus $70 million. This outlook considers our current understanding of the impact related to the recent legislation enacted on Monday. It's important to remember that this customer's revenue has been significantly reduced over the last year to a low single-digit percent of total sales. We anticipate B2B revenue to decrease modestly for the third quarter. Strong growth in automotive as well as growth in industrial is more than offset by a decline in communications. This decline in communications is related to a slowdown of deployment as we forecasted in the last call and the limited impact from the recent legislation. On a year-over-year basis, B2B revenue is forecasted to increase low to mid-single digits. We anticipate our operating margin to be approximately 42% plus or minus 100 bps. We're planning for the tax rate to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.32 plus or minus $0.10. So now I'll close my remarks by stating that third quarter proved better than our expectations, largely driven by our conservative planning and aggressive execution. As we move through the integration planning process with Maxim, we remain fully committed to driving sustainable growth through cutting-edge innovation and a focus on our customer success. I'm going to pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. I'll listen to all your feedback about the \u2013 around questions and the number of questions on the call. So we're going to run this a little differently than normal. I ask that limit yourself to one question to allow time for additional participants on this call this morning. And with that Cheryl, can we have our first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Hi, guys. Good morning and congratulations on the solid results. I just want to follow up on the recent Department of Commerce ruling. Am I to read into that that you've embedded sort of zero revenue coming from that one customer? And just given how strong China has been as a region Vince, are you at all worried that there's been pull forward, or is that just a natural offshoot of that's the geo where a lot of 5G deployment is happening? Vincent Roche : Yes. Good question. Thanks, John. So we have pretty much discounted our top \u2013 what used to be our number one customer in China to pretty much zero in our long-term planning thinking. It has been a low single-digit customer over the past few quarters. So we have factored also by the way the latest regulatory upheaval into our numbers. So at this point in time, the largest 5G customer there in China that used to be is no longer part of the planning or the -- either in the short term or the long term. I'd say as well, what we've seen in terms of the strength in China that Prashanth referred to is really -- is the fact that China was the first to go into the pandemic. First to come out. It's an economy that's growing very, very rapidly and has been up for several years now. So, I think, there's been a very good balance I believe between supply and demand across all the sectors. I mean, we've seen growth in all markets with the exception of automotive. So I think what we're seeing in terms of the strength in China is more about the match between the strength in our business and the economy than anything else. John Pitzer : Perfect. Thanks guys. Vincent Roche : Our next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong execution. I wanted to follow up on John's question about your communications business. And I was hoping Vince, if you could help us quantify how much communications could perhaps decline sequentially? And what are you baking in from this Department of Commerce regulation? And then, I think that the bigger question there is that as we look forward to next year, do you think global 5G deployments can stay on track if Huawei doesn't get access to U.S. technology? Like are we really contemplating a world where Huawei is not going to be a player at all in 5G deployment? And if there is such a world, does it still mean that 5G deployments globally can actually happen at the pace people were thinking about before? Any perspective would be very useful. Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Vivek, we're going to split that. And let me take the first part of it. So to clarify, third quarter we believe did not see any pull-ins from Huawei. Fourth quarter outlook reflects the guidance we gave you reflects the full impact for us of the Department of Commerce implications from earlier this week. So, all of that is now baked in. In terms of the amount of decline that we are expecting in the communications business, this is a lumpy business. We've said that consistently. It's growth measured in years and lumpy by quarter. We don't give forward guidance on an end market basis by quarter anymore. We haven't done that for a little bit of time. So, we don't want to start that now. But take it to understand that the movement in the communications business from third to fourth quarter was very much in normal operating lumpiness of the communications business is not exacerbated in any way by what happened on Monday or Tuesday's announcement. And now I'll pass back to Vince for your more challenging strategic question. Vincent Roche : Yes. So Vivek, I've been in this business a long, long time actually since two -- the inception of 2G all those years ago back in the late 80s, early 90s and what I can tell you is that the patterns we're seeing in 5G are no different to what we've seen in 2G, 3G or 4G. And if you look at 4G specifically, just to give you a bit of perspective here, we grew albeit a very, very lumpy business as we always say, but we grew over the entire era of its build out by mid-single digits. We had more content than we had in the prior generations. We took more share. And we're actually even better positioned in 5G because, it's a more complex radio problem fundamentally. We have a lot more technology to put into the space from microwave and RF right down to the mixed signal. And now, we're attaching power also, so, another factor that we're beginning to see the emergence of. So today, 5G has really been about giving more bandwidth to the consumer, more throughput to the consumer. The future is about I think B2B more so than the consumer. And we're beginning to see I believe the early adoption of 5G in the factory automation area. In fact, I have verified that with some of our industrial automation customers as well. So, 3Q is definitely likely the highest revenue quarter this year, but there are lots of drivers at the secular level and the company level to keep us in good stead for growth over the long term. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Vivek, I'll add one thing to try to avoid the plethora of Huawei questions that I can tell are winding up. So we've given you a lot of context around that customer. We said they're a mid-single-digit customer. The legislation put in place was, you we can ship for about half this quarter. So they'll be lower this quarter than normal. And going forward after that our expectation should be, it goes to zero. So our outlook for 1Q would be down for communications because of that. Vincent Roche : The last couple of quarters have actually been low single digits. And as we've said now a couple of times, we are no longer factoring Huawei into our numbers. Vivek Arya : Thanks for that. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you. Sheryl, next question, please? Sheryl, are we still on the call? I guess not. Operator : Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations, especially during these tough times. I had a question on sort of bookings linearity and backlog. I know last quarter you obviously entered the quarter with pretty high backlog and you were sort of discounting that. Are we sort of back to a more normal backlog level now for either you Vince or Prashanth? Vincent Roche : Yes. So let's -- maybe let me answer that by talking about the order patterns. So we saw strong May, some slowdown in June, which was expected. July was sort of a stable month-over-month and that was better than we expected. Through August, relatively stable and August is typically a lower seasonal month. So we have lower backlog in third quarter, as we enter the quarter and a good balance between supply and demand. This quarter, as we look forward to our guide, we\u2019ve got stronger coverage from backlog than we typically do. And if we converted -- if you recall in the third quarter we said that, we had about $50 million of products that we couldn't ship in the second quarter that we caught up with in the third quarter. That actually came in a little bit higher, because we had fewer cancellations. So we probably had maybe $100 million all-in of revenue in third quarter that really related to backlog from second quarter. So, I think, that through fourth quarter we're going to get supply and demand back in balance. Backlog has come down and will be more back to normal levels. As we have guided for the fourth quarter, we've taken into consideration the stronger backlog, but we've also taken into consideration that at an ADI level our book-to-bill for the fourth quarter is now below parity. Tore Svanberg : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Tore. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vincent Roche : Ambrish, go ahead. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Can you guys hear me? Vincent Roche : We can Ambrish. Yes. Ambrish Srivastava : Okay. Vince, I wanted to pivot back to the strategic priorities and thanks for articulating everything in context of the latest acquisition. This is a question I get a lot and I scratch my head on this too, because of you bought Linear and then Maxim also on the power side. So the question -- and you did provide us with some details on Linear. A couple of questions tied to that. With respect to Hittite you have given us the growth in Hittite versus what it used to grow and how you have been able to grow that versus prior to acquisition. So the question is, how has Linear done with respect to the core business? And I don't expect you to answer it every quarter, but I think it's a pertinent question in light of the Maxim acquisition. So kind of two-part question. One how has Linear done since you bought it? And then, this was the year that we were supposed to get revenue synergy. Now this is a very topsy-turvy year, so we all understand that. But should we expect revenue synergies to start showing up from Linear with all the efforts that have been going on? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. So we have already seen the benefit of LTC in our growth numbers. I would say at this point in time we've put more than 100 basis points of growth on the base Linear growth rate to-date. We have -- I think the greatest indicator for what things are likely to be in the future I've said before that I believe that we can double the growth rate of LT over the longer term and just given the markets in which we play and the design cycles the product cycles it takes three years minimum and then you begin to see the real benefits I think after five years. So we're over 100 basis points of additive growth right now. And if you look at our pipeline I referred to it in the prepared remarks we have got a design win pipeline of over $0.5 billion thus far. We have seen wins in communications both on the wireless side as well as the data center side. Infotainment in automotive infotainment radar and of course BMS. We're seeing tremendous uptake for some of our more integrated products in areas like instrumentation tests using our micromodule technologies. And I'm quite pleased given the turmoil in the global markets right now that we continue to see good traction on the design win rates and I'm confident that we can get from 3% to 4% growth rates in the past to more a higher -- mid to high single-digit level in the future and do it sustainably. So I think we have emerging evidence that we're on good track to do that. Ambrish Srivastava : Okay. Thank you. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Ambrish. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Good morning, guys and congrats on the strong results. Vince, I had a question on your automotive business. Curious how are you thinking about the shape of the recovery in automotive over the next couple of quarters? Obviously, you've been impacted by your customer factory shutdowns and the demand situation post-COVID. But curious are you thinking it could be more of a V-shaped recovery, could it be more U-shaped? Any thoughts there would be super helpful? And if you can speak to your key applications within automotive, you gave great color on the July quarter but if you can talk about BMS A2B some of the key growth drivers for October and beyond that would be helpful? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Okay. Thanks, Toshi. So yes, we're seeing a recovery in the market. Actually our book-to-bill was greater than unity across all regions over the last month or so. And we believe that our third quarter represents the bottom of the cycle for us. So I think the near-term recovery and the demand that we're seeing relates to factories coming back online and also a slow improvement in SAAR. So I think the shape of the recovery really depends on the demand -- the end demand for cars and how SAAR actually grows. And we'll -- that will need -- we'll need to see continued vehicle demand to get back to the pre-COVID level. So it's not there yet. So factories are coming back online. Demand is slowly increasing. So hard to call the exact shape but somewhere between a V and a U I guess or maybe already a U and we're seeing the upsurge. I would say electric vehicles in general have held up better in this market. As we said in the prepared remarks there's a strong consumer preference for electric vehicles. It's the fastest-growing sector at this point in time. And we're continuing to gain share in the market. We've seen growth quarter-on-quarter in that space. And we're also very pleased with our performance. A2B actually grew about, I think, it was 70% year-to-date. So the adoption the design wins that we had gotten last year across most of the OEMs beginning to turn into serious revenue now. And on top of that, we're also overlaying this road noise cancellation technology that uses our digital signal processors, algorithmic technology and different analog, support technologies on the input and output there. So those are the major areas. And I think, as I said, I believe, we're in a slow recovery phase in automotive. And I think in general very hard to call the next quarter, the next two quarters, but my sense is 2021 will be a growth year for the industry and a growth year for ADI. And \u2013 I mean, that's how I viewed at this point in time. So we're seeing a gentle recovery in general across all our market spaces. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm a little bit confused. I know you've been saying, we're entering into recovery, but how do I square that with a book-to-bill going forward that is less than one? I mean, is it just comm? Like, how should I be thinking about book-to-bill by segment? And what does that imply for like the longer-term trajectory? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah. Great question, Stacy. The \u2013 so I would say that, certainly, the communications business is a piece of that. And I would also say that, we \u2013 when we look back at the demand activity over the last quarter or two, we feel very good that that was driven by very kind of real demand based on conversations with customers. But there was probably some level of inventory building that was going on in there given that the inventory levels at our end customers were so low. Coming into this pandemic, they had taken \u2013 end customers really at the industrial level had taken their inventory levels down pretty significantly in 2019. And then the pandemic hit. And so I think some of the strength that the industry is seeing now has a little bit of that renormalizing that. So as we kind of look forward into fourth quarter, there is a lot of opportunity for us. And I think that, the new order activity remains good over dues are declining. So it's \u2013 I think, we'll have to let another quarter or two roll out. We don't have enough visibility I think to tell you what the future portends. But we're not seeing a sharp decline in order activity, but it is below one. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. But just to clarify \u2013 I'm sorry? Michael Lucarelli : Stacy, we are guiding down sequentially. Our book-to-bill is slightly below one. So it does go in tandem to what we're saying. And you're right to think about the tele market. Comm is much below one, auto is a bit above one, industrials around one. So it all lines up to what the guidance we gave and the range we have given. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. Thank you, guys. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Stacy. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Stacy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse, Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a cycle question. And if I look at your S-4, and you projected revenues in there for fiscal 2020, that roughly $170 million below what you're actually looking to accomplish here. And so curious, versus what you put there in the S-4, what led to the upside there? And is that something that we should think can continue beyond the October quarter? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: C.J., that was really around the timing of when we're having those conversations. If you look back at the timing of when we were in those, the world looked very different to us. I think it looked differently to everyone back at that period, when the pandemic looked like it was ranging at a pretty sharp pace across the globe. So, our S-4 probably reflected more of the uncertainty that we had out there that has since been -- more clarity has been brought. C.J. Muse: Okay. Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : We'll go to our last question please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Thanks. Just a question for Vince, on the industrial market and really about the composition maybe in the next couple of quarters, so certainly medical has been strong instrumentation. The more cyclically oriented factory automation has been weak. Do you expect any reversal in some of that kind of by sub-segment performance as we move forward from here and the macro recovers? Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, we've seen -- I mean energy is a couple of hundred million dollar business a year for ADI. That's been doing well, and we're getting a lot of new design wins. In renewables area, we've seen strong demand in our test business, supporting 5G build out and data centers in particular. And we're seeing a little more weakness in instrumentation in areas that relate more to CapEx. If you look at aerospace and defense, which is an important part of our industrial story, obviously there's weakness in avionics that won't be a huge surprise. But that's a relatively small portion. The biggest portion of our aerospace and defense business is defense, and that business is holding up well as well as the space business, which continues to grow nicely. I would say as well automation is holding better than we had thought. But what really excites us there is the future, as our customers rethink supply chains onshoring, reshoring, and we're going to see more and more automation used in general across the globe. So, I think that unpacks the story for you. So, I think we're seeing strength pretty much across all the sectors or recovery across all the sectors in industrial right now. Craig Hettenbach : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks so much, Craig. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website and all reconciliations and additional information can also be found there.

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now on to disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our objectives, outlook and the proposed Maxim transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release, our most recent 10-K and other periodic reports and materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking - this forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time. So 2020 represents a year of strategic progress for ADI in a very highly uncertain macroeconomic environment. Fortunately, ADI was already operating from a position of strength. Over the last decade, we've created a structurally more profitable business. We realigned our portfolio to target more durable end markets and become more diverse across customers, products and applications. During this past year and at the height of the pandemic, this business model proved quite resilient with gross and operating margins troughing at 68% and 37%, respectively, levels we previously considered peak. It's this resiliency that enables us to sustain a healthy of \u2013 level of investment against any economic backdrop. We\u2019ve also been not afraid to make strategic pivots towards the most attractive investment opportunities that enhance our customer engagement and better align us to secular growth trends, such as digital healthcare. Clearly, the biggest investment decision of 2020 was our strategic combination with Maxim, which will further extend the scale and scope of our semiconductor portfolio. And I'll expand on this in a while. As I reflect on the immediate challenges of our current environment, we believe there is more ADI can do to leverage our expertise to engineer a more sustainable future and make an even more positive impact on the world. To that end, earlier this year, we published our first Corporate Responsibility Report and launched the semiconductor industry's first green bond. We also took action in the global fight against COVID-19. We prioritized production of our healthcare solutions to support customers and we're partnering with hospitals and biotech startups to develop solutions that leverage our technology. And our impact has extended beyond our own facilities and capabilities, as we've made multimillion dollar donations through the ADI Foundation to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. Overall, I'm very proud of how we've come together. We embraced and learned from this challenging time and continue to execute at a high level to generate and capture value in the market. Now turning to our results. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.53 billion and adjusted EPS was $1.44, above the high end of our outlook. For the year, revenue was $5.6 billion, down mid-single digits year-over-year. This was partly driven by the economic volatility and supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic. Despite this, our cumulative B2B revenue outperformed peers for a third consecutive year. We actively managed operating expenses, delivering operating margins of 40% and adjusted EPS of $4.91. We generated approximately $1.8 billion in free cash flow in 2020. While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is just below our long-term financial model, we continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500. So now, I'd like to provide an update on how we are shaping ADI to be even more impactful in the future. During the year, we invested more than $1 billion in R&D, with over 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This includes funding new product development to fortify our franchises and drive new vectors of growth. As you know, we selectively use M&A to complement these organic investments. And we've taken a very significant step forward with the pending acquisition of Maxim. The numerous customers I've spoken with about our combination are delighted that we will join forces. Maxim will strengthen our leadership in the semiconductor industry, creating a more comprehensive analog mixed-signal and power portfolio and further diversifying our business across markets and applications. And at 10,000 engineers strong, the acquisition will solidify ADI as the destination for the world's best analog talent. We've also been disciplined in our approach to managing our balance sheet. Since we closed the Linear acquisition, we've cut our leverage ratio in half, increased our dividend by 40% and repurchased more than $1 billion of shares. And Prashanth will provide further details on our capital allocation outlook for 2021. Shifting now to customer engagement. Our focus has been unwavering, as we continued to solve our customers' toughest challenges. A key strength of ADI is our standard products portfolio. With its unparalleled breadth and depth from DC to 100 gigahertz, from nanowatts to kilowatts and from sensor to cloud, we define the edge of performance. Our portfolio is sold across customers of all sizes and provides recurring revenue for decades. But what's just as important, these standard products are the foundation upon which we build more targeted integrated solutions for higher growth vertical applications, such as 5G radio systems and automotive battery management. To that end, industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever and new industries are emerging, focused on the physical and cyber. In many ways, it's semiconductors that are enabling the current virtual economy and ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this evolution and well aligned with key secular growth trends. Now looking across our segments, I'd like to share some highlights with you. Starting first with industrial, this is an incredibly fragmented market with expanding needs as it transitions Industry 4.0 and beyond. We're in a unique position to not only solve traditional challenges like precision signal processing, control and power, but also new emerging challenges like connectivity and safety. For example, our time-of-flight solution enables safer factory floors by preventing accidents between humans, robots, and cobots. And our connectivity portfolio of Deterministic Ethernet, secure microwave, RF and 5G, is helping our customers to create ubiquitous connectivity, merging their operational and informational technologies to unlock the true value of Industry 4.0. In healthcare, the pandemic is accelerating the market towards telemedicine and transitioning care into the home. To support this, systems are being upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring is extending outside of the hospital. We doubled our investment ahead of this trend, bring it to market hundreds of new products and tilting our offerings towards complete system solutions. The result, over the last five years, we've grown our customer base by over 20% and our revenues at a double-digit rate even when excluding pandemic-related demand. And we're now increasing our investment in sensing, computing and cloud, to help enable the secular shift to healthcare from anywhere. In communications, we're the market leader in 5G, a position that will deliver significant growth as 5G broadens globally in 2021 and beyond. At the same time, we view open radio access networks, or O-RAN, as a disruptive technology that enables carriers to scale and upgrade their networks more quickly and economically, an important step to help proliferate 5G into new markets. And for ADI's wireless franchise, O-RAN opens up new avenues for growth. To get ahead of the market, we're further innovating our transceiver and power portfolios to shape the radio of the future. We're also forming strategic partnerships with ecosystem participants such as Intel and Marvell. And this strategy is working. Last quarter, we announced the collaboration with NEC to enable the first O-RAN installation for Rakuten Mobile. The automotive market is undergoing a revolution, with electric vehicles becoming mainstream. ADI is at the heart of this movement, with over half of the top 10 EV brands using our BMS solution. And our new wireless BMS offers the same reliability and performance of our wired solution while enhancing robustness and configurability. General Motors recently announced that they will deploy our wireless BMS across their entire Ultium battery line. Since the launch, just a few months ago, interest in this groundbreaking technology is gaining momentum across the ecosystem. Looking at automotive more broadly, demand for our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation is intensifying. Our innovative solutions are not only the highest fidelity performance technology in the market, but they also reduce weight, removing nearly 100 pounds from an average vehicle. We've also identified opportunities to attach our LTC portfolio with our A2B platform to deliver both data and power up to 50 watts. By combining all these capabilities, we are creating deeper customer relationships while increasing our SAM for audio system. Turning to consumer now. This is a market that have had its fair share of challenges over the last few years for ADI. However, we believe that the business has bottomed in 2020. Recent design wins across a diverse customer base for new and emerging applications like hearables, wearables, high-end audio and video solutions put consumer on a multi-year growth trajectory. So in closing, this was clearly an unprecedented year for us all. We are optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway, but acknowledge that the recovery remains dependent on the economic impacts of the pandemic. With that said, I'm encouraged by our momentum and we expect 2021 to be a growth year for the company. We've seen an improvement across nearly all of our end markets and our portfolio is strategically aligned with favorable secular growth trends, a position that gets only stronger with Maxim. In my 30-years plus at ADI, I've never been more confident about our prospects than I'm today. And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release. Let me start with a brief recap of 2020. The heightened uncertainty and significant disruption due to the pandemic certainly created a very volatile year. Revenue of $5.6 billion was down 6% year-over-year. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the year and our revenue was up 14% in the second-half compared to the first. Gross margins finished at 69%, down slightly year-over-year, but we enter 2021 within our long-term financial model. Op margins landed at 40%, as we prudently managed our discretionary spend. All told, full-year adjusted EPS was $4.91. Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up 5% sequentially, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. This exceeded the high-end of our outlook, driven mainly by stronger-than-anticipated growth in automotive. And if we look at the individual segments, in the fourth quarter, industrial, which represented 53% of revenue, was up 5% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. We saw growth across nearly all our major applications, notably automation, which makes up approximately 20% of industrial, grew for the first time in two years. For the year, industrial revenue was about flat, underscoring the diversification across customers and applications in this business. In the fourth quarter, communications, which represented 20% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially. However, the segment was up 19% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in both wireless and wireline. Importantly, our growth was not aided by customer pull-in activity related to geopolitical tensions. And for the year, communications revenue was down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding Huawei sales that were impacted in '19 and '20 by Entity List restrictions, our revenue grew modestly, a testament to our strong positions in 5G and optical control for carrier networks and data center. In the fourth quarter, automotive which represented 15% of revenue, was up over 40% sequentially and up modestly year-over-year. While we exit the year with revenue above pre-pandemic levels, it was still down mid-teens for the year due to lower vehicle production. And finally, in the fourth quarter, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, finished up 12% sequentially, down 17% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, we believe we're positioned to grow in '21 and beyond after three years of declines. Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 70%, up 160 bps year-over-year. OpEx was $431 million, up 7% sequentially, as we reinstated merit and experienced higher variable compensation. Op margins finished at 41.7%, up nearly 300 bps year-over-year. Non-op expense was $44 million, down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. And our tax rate was lower than usual at approximately 10% and adjusted EPS was $1.44. If we shift to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars on our balance sheet declined modestly sequentially and inventory days finished at 121 days, down from 125 days in the third quarter. Channel inventory fell slightly and remains below our seven-week to eight-week target as we saw strong sell-through trends across all geographies. We plan to return to our target inventory model as we progress through '21. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was $673 million, up 2% year-over-year. Given the pandemic, we continue to be judicious with our CapEx, spending only $30 million this quarter or 2% of revenue. We do anticipate CapEx to normalize to around 4% of revenue for 2021. And for the full year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, or about 80% of free cash flow after debt repayments. This was below our target, as we paused our share buyback program at the height of the pandemic and then were restricted following the Maxim announcement. As a result, our cash position increased to over $1 billion. During the quarter, we used $450 million of our cash flow to retire our 2021 notes. Total debt ended the year at approximately $5.1 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis. Recently, we reinstated our share buyback program, which has $1.9 billion left in authorization, or approximately 4% of shares outstanding. Given our low leverage, we do not plan to reduce debt further in '21. For context, over the last three years, we've decreased our debt by approximately $3 billion. This stronger balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent share buybacks and targeted acquisitions. So now let's look at our first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $70 million. At the midpoint of guide, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase high-teens year-over-year. Op margins are expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint, down sequentially due to higher variable comp and annual merit. Interest expense is also expected to be down slightly sequentially. For 2021, we anticipate a tax rate between 12% and 14%. And based on these inputs, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.10. I'll wrap with a brief update on our pending acquisition of Maxim. In September, we received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in the US regarding our merger. Followed by the overwhelming shareholder support of the combination from both ADI and Maxim shareholders, we also submitted initial applications for regulatory clearance in China and the EU. I'm very encouraged by our progress and we remain on track to close the acquisition in the summer of 2021. We are excited about this complementary combination and together, we expect that we will capture additional growth in the years ahead. So with that, let me turn it back over to Mike to lead the Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Let's get to our Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow time for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question, please re-queue and we will take your question if time allows. With that, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the strong execution, especially the free cash flow generation. Vince, my question is on the demand environment, both near-term and what do you sense for the next calendar year? So in the near-term, which end markets do you feel are back to normal levels, which are below trend line? Because when I look at your January outlook, up 15% or so year-on-year, obviously, against some easier comps. You're certainly starting the year on a very strong note. But just how should we think about the overall year in terms of the puts and takes for the different end markets in industrial, auto, comms and consumer? Any broad color just near-term and then for calendar 2021, I think, it would be really helpful to help kind of frame our models for your forecast? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Sure. Thanks for your question, Vivek. I would say, clearly, as you said, overall demand is better. And I think as well, there is a very good balance between supply and demand. Inventories are, I'd say, very, very well balanced with our customers as best we can tell. Right now, we are seeing very strong trends in automotive and industrial, while we expected comms a little softer after a big first-half of 2020. But overall, I believe 2021, I think I said in the last call is going to be a solid growth year for ADI and for the industry. And my conviction has become even stronger since the last earnings call here. Let me try and unpack things little for you. If I go through a couple of the market segments, industrial, we've clearly seen a broadening of demand. And if you look at 2020, the first-half was clearly about healthcare, aerospace and defense and automatic test equipment, strength in those areas and that strength has persisted, I think, persisted in the second-half of the year. And I think the second-half actually saw good strength emerge in factory automation, process automation, they are more horizontal businesses for ADI. So, we believe that, that strength will continue into the first quarter and beyond. Automotive, as you will have seen, we had a strong upsurge there as well and the business, in fact, is now back to pre-COVID levels. And bookings continue to remain strong in that area. And if I look at just the sub-segments within to give you a little bit of color, electrification is strong, so are BMS solutions, where we're on the fifth generation of BMS product solutions, are doing particularly well. And our infotainment business, which is - which has emerged beyond high fidelity rendering of audio and video. Our A2B solutions are emerging with great strength, given the pipeline that we've been building over the last several years really. And you will have seen no doubt as well, the active road noise cancellation solutions are riding again on top of the platform. So if I look at maybe comms a little bit here, so 2020 was strong actually across both wireless and wired. Actually, both were up in the fourth quarter of high-teens year-over-year. So if we extract Huawei, where we had the restrictions, 2020 was strong across all the rest of the customers. In fact, they grew during 2020. So, I think 2021 will be about the performance of 5G, which is a pretty good part of the communication story. I expect it will move more global beyond China, particularly with deployments in North America. And I'm glad to have report as well, consumer has been on the downward for ADI for several years. But we believe now that we've reached the bottom as we had expected in 2020. And given the diversity of applications that we're now addressing, broader-based customers, we feel good about that business in both the portable as well as the more professional solutions that we serve also. So hopefully, that answers your question completely, Vivek. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Vivek. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : We'll go to next question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the results. Vince, I was hoping you could zoom in a little bit more on comms and on 5G. You talked about O-RAN. Obviously, ADI has a very flexible approach with the software-defined radio. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about how that architecture plays into the role of O-RAN and just maybe some more comments on 5G generally? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. So if I look at what's happening in the business, maybe I'll take a shorter-term view than the slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So, what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer to the last question there, comms in general for us has seen strength in both wireless and wired technologies, optical wired, particularly in the wired area. And what we're seeing is obviously more aggressive deployments of these massive MIMO-based systems, where our channel count continues to increase, which gives ADI a lot more content for radio. And I would also say that our portfolio has never been stronger given the investments we've been making up for several years. And our customer share has never been higher with the key OEMs far more balanced in terms of the span of technologies and products that we're supplying. So, I think it's important to remember 5G is at the early stages of multi-year, probably a decade of ramp here. And I think 2021 will be characterized by the deployments of 5G more globally beyond China. I expect America to be the primary driver probably towards the second-half of 2021 for 5G. And we've also - we've seen a lot of interest in our technologies for O-RAN. We're working with ecosystem partners in that area. You will have seen. Also the first announcement we've had publicly about the use of our technologies - our radio technologies with Rakuten Mobile in Japan through our partnership with NEC. So, I think it's classical 5G being deployed for consumer applications will continue rapidly over the next three years. But I'm also beginning to see now the early stages of adoption of 5G into more deterministically critical applications like healthcare, factory automation and so on and so forth. So, I think if you look over the long-term, Tore, this is going to continue to be a growth market for ADI with more content. We've got a stronger position with our customers and we continue to push the boundaries of technology here to enable our customers to simply now to deal with the complexity, that's increasing exponentially and the more rapid innovation cycles with our software-defined radio systems. Tore Svanberg : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Tore. We'll go to next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Congratulations on solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. A modeling question for Prashanth. Prashanth, if you look at the quarter just reported, the October quarter, incremental op margins were perhaps lower than I would have expected. I'm assuming that's variable comp coming back into the model as you guys continue to do better on the top line. But I'd be curious as you look into the January quarter, how we should be thinking about OpEx just given how funky a year, calendar year '20 was because COVID had both some puts and some takes on the OpEx and expense line? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thank you for the question, John. So let me handle that in two pieces. Let's talk gross margins and then OpEx. So for the quarter just passed, 70% gross margins, we had pretty considerable upside from automotive. And so we have some mix headwind with that kind of explosive growth in automotive. It's below the corporate average in terms of margins. As we think about gross margins for the coming quarter - for the first quarter, we are passing through the holiday period. So, we're going to have a little bit of continued pressure on utilization, as we have some of our - some of our fabs will be shut down for the holiday period. But we expect that to improve as the year progresses and we bring in the remaining $50 million of cost reductions from the shutdown of the two LTC facilities in the balance of 2021. On the OpEx side, you're exactly right. We've designed our variable comp system to really act as a shock absorber, as a flywheel. So in 2020 when we had the great deal of uncertainty, that operated the way it should and it unwound. In addition, we made a decision as a leadership team to delay implementing merit in 2020. And we brought that back into place just this past quarter. So, you will see headwind from those - from both of those decisions into the first quarter and I've mentioned that in my guide. So it's both - in my prepared remarks, it's both, a full quarter of merit and better variable compensation. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, John. Cheryl, we'll go to our next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open. Ambrish Srivastava : Vince, I wanted to zoom in on the industrial business. This business has been a really resilient compared to the past cycles for yourself, as well as your larger peers. So the question really is, can you just help us understand - and you gave us a number, 20%, for automation. But if you help us understand the various segments that are contributing to how you're able to kind of cloud through what we have seen a pretty disastrous 1Q, 2Q? And then with Maxim, we all understand the complementary parts or the additive parts on the automotive. Can you just help us understand how does the industrial business benefit from the Maxim business that you'll be bolting on? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. So, thanks Ambrish. First and foremost, it's still a fairly tricky time in terms of trying to predict GDP. But we've come out of the year with tremendous strength. First-half of the year for ADI was about aerospace and defense, healthcare and the automatic test equipment sector as well. So - and that's continued, by the way, through the second-half. And then, we're building upon that in the - with the upsurge, the second-half is the expansion of growth in factory automation, which is, particularly in the fourth quarter, we began to see a very, very good surge, which we expect to continue by the way, albeit of, I'll say, somewhat depressed base as economic expansion really takes roof, I believe, in 2021. So - and also, this business for ADI, industrial is more than half of the company's revenue. The crop of products out there is stronger than it has ever been in the history of the company. Our focus - a decade ago, we decided this was really the roof of the company and we're beginning to really see, demonstrated in our results versus our competition and we're gaining market share, I think that's important to note. So, we cover more customers with more market share, with better product portfolio. So with Industry 4.0 coming on board, healthcare moving towards digitalization, telemedicine, these all bode really well for ADI for the long term. And where does Maxim add value to it as well? Industrial actually is - is really about - is primarily about precision signal processing and power management. And Maxim brings a long heritage in those two areas, which we will deploy to even greater effect across the spectrum of sensor to cloud, the raw signal that are sensing the signal, capture signal processing, connectivity. And that bodes very well for ADI. So, I'm excited about getting more capabilities to bring to more customers. As they require ADI to sell bigger swaths of problems, the complexity is growing in terms of their needs. The analog scale is becoming scarcer and scarcer. So, we will bring more of that skill to bear to solve more problems in a more complete way for our customers. So, I think that's the way to think about it, Ambrish. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Ambrish. Go to our next question, please, Cheryl. Operator : Your next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse: Thank you for taking the question. Another question on the industrial side, Vince. The business is growing 9% year-on-year in October, yet over the last few years is essentially flat. And so curious, it sounds like automation growing for the first time in two years is a real positive signal. So would kind of love to hear your thoughts on, as we come out of this pandemic, what that business segment growth could look like considering some of the growth factors that you're investing in like healthcare, as well as perhaps some of the more tried-and-true machinery, typical industrial business is beginning to recover? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. So if I look - thanks, C.J. If you look out over the longer term, so industrial automation has been really on its way down for the last two years, two and a half years. And some of that was driven by the trade tensions. Obviously, with the automotive sector way off in, I mean, SAAR was dropping anyway in 2019, the pandemic crush demand there even more so in 2020. So, automotive is a big, big consumer of sophisticated factory automation systems. So that's all improving. If I think about the long-term prospects for the business given the vectors, the market vectors, the technology vectors that we've got, my sense is if you think over the longer-term here and integrate the demand over three-year, five-year period, my sense is this business can grow in the mid-to-high single digit level for ADI. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, C.J. Go to next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Vince, I wanted to follow up on the automotive business, both in terms of your Q4 performance as well as the outlook into fiscal year '21. Just as sort of a clarification on Q4, you guys grew 40%, 40% plus sequentially. I think you were guiding that business to be up in the low teens. So obviously, a very big beat in the quarter. Was that essentially a function of higher volume across your customers and therefore, a beat across most of your customers and most of your applications? Or were there any specific standouts in the quarter? I guess more importantly, into fiscal year '21, when you think about your automotive business and the potential for growth there versus the rate of recovery in the overall global automotive industry, what kind of outperformance would you expect on top of automotive production? It appears as though you guys talk about BMS and active noise cancellation, in particular, but are there any specific drivers that you're most excited about? Thank you. Vincent Roche : So let me try and unpack that for you. So yes, in fourth quarter, we were up 2% year-over-year. And actually, we had strength across all the applications. But even though our battery management solutions were down year-on-year, we did better than the overall market at large. And our position has gained strength with the new offerings that we have and the sheer performance that we bring that nobody else can match in terms of the sensing and the single processing. So, I think that, just looking at the prognostications of what electrification will do in the electric vehicle area, I think that's a growth trend for decade, decade and a half, two decades. So, we feel good about that given our position. I think also if you just look at the fourth quarter, I talked previously about our signal processing platform, high performance signal processing platform based on our DSP, our A2B technology road noise cancellation. A2B alone was up 70% in the year. So, we've been talking about it a long time. But now the revenues are really coming home to roost in that area. If I look at 1Q, typically, the automotive business for ADI is down seasonally, but we believe that it will be up. So the strength that we've been seeing coming through the fourth quarter here will continue into the first and beyond. And if I look at just the areas that I feel really enthusiastic about that we've been steering investment increasingly towards over the last three years or so, I talked already about the electric vehicle market. And we think about that as an opportunity from battery formation to battery deployment and battery discharge. So, we're growing share in those key markets and we continue to innovate in the space and create more blue sky between ourselves and our competition, as the problems that our customers are solving become more and more challenging. So, we've brought wireless BMS quite recently, which we've announced a partnership with GM. But that is only the start. That is a new growth dimension for ADI in the automotive sector. I've talked about infotainment already, A2B, road noise cancellation. And we've managed to grow that business in 2020 despite the really, really compressor. The other thing I should point out is that we're still in the early innings of attaching our power franchise in the automotive of critical applications in which we play and that's all still ahead of us. Again, we feel good about that in areas like safety, the radar, as well as vision-based safety systems. And just in the car in general, power is an area where we've made excellent progress, I think, getting design ends. Now, we're turning them to revenue. Michael Lucarelli : Good. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Blayne Curtis : I just want to revisit answer. On the comm, you talked about longer term drivers like O-RAN. I'm just kind of curious. In the January, I think there is going to be a pause between Phase 1 Phase 2 in China. I'm just kind of curious on your perspective. Seems like it might be down a little bit in January. Just curious, when do you think comm could see a recovery in any perspective and timing of China coming back? Michael Lucarelli : Yes. I think comms is down sequentially. I mean, a big reason why comms was down sequentially in 1Q is the Huawei ban. Huawei was a low single-digit customer, call it, 2%, 3% of sales. They're going to be zero. So, that'll be a headwind into our first quarter. And you're right, I think the timing of next run of China 5G deployment are TBD. I think when they do happen, it will be a great business for us and we'll continue to grow in that market. But it's very hard to call when that market will turn back on. Sometime likely in the first-half of '21, but really unsure to pinpoint it today when that's going to be, given all the geopolitical tensions out there. I think, Vince, did a good job talking about how it's not just about China. The good thing, as you moved to '21, it's more global 5G. North America should start ticking off. Europe, Japan, Korea, has really started to broaden out and less about China. China still will be the biggest market, but really global 5G deployment should do better year-on-year in '21. Michael Lucarelli : Can we go to our last question, please? Operator : And our last question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Seymore : Thanks for sneaking me in. I just wanted to wrap up with a little bit of the linearity of demand. Can you just talk about the bookings that you've seen? Have any of the concerns that your customers have had in the past about supply disruptions and all those sorts of things? It seems like those have gone away, given your commentary on channel inventory. But just wanted to get kind of what your book-to-bill was and how linearity played out through the October quarter, please? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So let me give you a couple of data points here. We started the quarter out strong in August, which was up from July and then we had a pretty normal September. Bookings remain solid so far. I think where - book to bill is at parity, where we're going into the first quarter with very normal backlog coverage for our outlook. All of that is reflected in the guide that we have. I did make a comment about inventory in the channel. So maybe that's also worth making sure people understand that we are below our seven-week to eight-week model and then we're going to kind of build ourselves back into that model over the course of 2021. So, that should also provide a little bit of a - a little bit tailwind as we go through 2021. Michael Lucarelli : All right. Thanks, Ross. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. And all available reconciliations, any additional information can also be found in the Quarterly Results section of our IR website. Thanks for joining us and your continued interest in Analog Devices. Hope everyone has a good holiday. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Mike Lucarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mike Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now onto the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our objectives, outlook and the proposed Maxim transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q and other periodic reports and materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vince Roche : Thanks very much Mike, and good morning to you all. So I'll start my remarks with a review of our results before providing insights into how we're shaping a more connected, safer and sustainable future. The first quarter we delivered strong results that came in at high end of our outlook. Revenue was $1.56 billion and increased 20% year-over-year. The strength was broad based, the growth across all end markets highlighted by a record quarter for our industrial business. We delivered gross margin of 70% and op margin of nearly 41%. All told, we produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.44. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion free cash flow equating to 33% free cash flow margin placing us in the top 10% of S&P 500. So overall I'm very pleased with our team's performance this quarter. Now I'd like to discuss how we're advancing our mission of engineering good for the planet, social health and economic prosperity which in turn will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Awareness of the world's environmental degradation and climate change specifically is growing tremendously with a global called action building momentum. Semiconductors, as the bedrock of the modern digital economy have a major role to play in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. At ADI, our technology sit at the intersection of our customers and societies most pressing challenges and we're uniquely positioned to drive positive impact. Our industry leading portfolio with its breadth of capabilities defines the edge of performance and inherently delivers sustainable benefit. With each generation of chip designed, we increase efficiency while enhancing the performance of our customers systems. This portfolio supports customers of all sizes and spans industries that are aligned with key secular trends. So today, I'll focus on where ADI is entering goods across the automation, electrification and connectivity sectors. Firstly, the automation of human routines, factory floors and supply chains is critical to our future and the pandemic has further accelerated this paradigm. The World Economic Forum is predicting that by 2025 over half of all tasks will be performed by machines at first in human history. To support this trend, our industrial customer base is boosting deployments of robots and cobots. Over the next five years the global robot installed base is expected to increase by about 60%. With industrial motors currently consuming 25% of all the world's electricity. We urgently need to deploy technologies that not only deliver speed and accuracy, safety and flexibility. But also energy savings. Now let me share a few examples of how our technologies are meeting these challenges in automation. So firstly, variable speed drives can reduce motor energy consumption by up to 40% in a robot. Our precision signal chain isolation and power management technologies together increase response time and improve power conversion. Secondly, our time of flight sensing technology allows robots to sense and interpret the world around them. So our customers can deploy more robots per square foot and improve workers safety. Thirdly, our OtoSense condition-based monitoring solution presciently identifies motor inefficiencies enabling customers to proactively optimize and repair machinery. This avoids costly downtime and lowers energy consumption by 10%. Importantly, these technologies that improve motor efficiency and robotic control can save almost one gigaton of annual CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 330 million residential homes. In total, automation is a key component of our industrial business supporting tens of thousands of customers. We expect this accelerated digitalization to drive continued growth in 2021 and beyond. Now I'll turn to electrification and discuss the important role ADI is playing as consumer demand for greener transportation accelerates. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2030 there will be approximately 215 million electric vehicles on the road up exponentially from about 7 million today. ADI's solutions are embedded across all phases of the electric vehicle journey from supporting EV infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. So I'll share now how our technologies are impacting this ecosystem. First, the shift to renewable energy sources drives great environmental benefits. But also creates new obstacles in distribution, transmission and stability. This requires a smart grid which can vividly monitor and adjust performance. Our control and sensing technologies are critical to ensuring the grid parameters remain stable and prevent shutdowns. This shift also requires energy storage systems to mitigate intermittency issues, related to variable user demand. Here our high accuracy monitoring and efficient power conversion technologies help extend systems battery life by more than 30%. Turning to the battery which is the most expensive vehicle part. Our Battery Management System or BMS enables up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. As the market leader, over half of the top 10 electric vehicle brands use ADI's BMS technology today. In addition, last fall we introduced the industry's first wireless BMS platform. This is all the benefits of our wired solution by lowering vehicle weights and enabling the scalable battery architecture, paving the way for reuse and storage systems. GM's Ultium platform uses our wireless BMS technology which is expected to be deployed across 30 different models by 2025. Interest in our wireless BMS technology is rising and last quarter, we recorded our second OEM design win. Importantly, the environmental impact from our BMS capabilities is notable. In 2020 alone, vehicles equipped with ADI's BMS technologies prevented approximately 70 million tons of carbon dioxide when entering the atmosphere. Our solutions utilized at the battery formation stage enabled more current density thereby shrinking our customer's equipment footprint by up to four times and reducing per channel costs by nearly half. Our technology makes it possible for factories to recycle more than 80% of the energy used during the formation back into the power grid. Based on today's production levels, energy recycling during formation reduces CO2 output by about 1 million tons annually. So all told, electrification not only represents highly valuable market with long-term revenue growth opportunities. But one that will be critical to the preservation of our precious natural ecosystem. So finally, let me turn to connectivity. In the face of the pandemic, connectivity has been the foundation that is sustaining and powering our society and the economy and while the communications market is not known historically for its sustainability benefits. This ability to stay connected and productive from anywhere has also had a positive impact on the environment, a clear proof point is the reduction of global carbon emissions by a record 7% in 2020. By 2030, forecast suggest mobile traffic will increase by about 17-fold. This exponential increase in wireless data combined with pervasive cloud computing puts IP traffic on pace to double every two and a half years. And ADI is playing a critical role in building out the next generation infrastructure to support this exponential increase in data. From capturing the signal at the base station air interface to transferring the information to the data center while substantially decreasing power. So ADI has invested ahead and reshaped the 5G radio architecture, our software defined transceivers with complementary precision signal chain and power technologies are vital to enabling the 5G massive manual architecture. When comparing 5G to 4G, our solutions help deliver a 90% decrease in energy per bit at the air interface by decreasing the channel count by 10x while maintaining the radio size and terminal performance. With the exponential upswing in data generation. Our customers are upgrading their optical infrastructure from 100 to 400 gigabits per second. Our precision signal chain technologies help enable these optical modules maintain constant power while operating at four times the data rate. And with the customers looking to increase to 1 terabit and beyond ADI's opportunity will continue to expand. Capturing and transporting data efficiently is important. But computing in data centers is the primary source of energy consumption in the connectivity ecosystem. Currently, data centers generate more than 130 million tons of CO2 per year globally. So this is where the transition from 12 to 48 volt power distribution can reduce power loss and increase compute density. Our 48 volt to core micromodules power and power system monitoring solutions are enabling this transition and according to Alphabet, this approach and approved data center energy efficiency by 30%. All told, ADI is part of the ecosystem enabling greater efficiency and wireless and wired data capture transmission and of course computing and our solutions of customers to scale their investments and build next generation networks economically and resourcefully. So stepping back, I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made on our mission to engineer good but a lot remains yet to be done. We're focused on partnering with our customers to develop increasingly innovative technologies that create successful business outcomes in rich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis which exclude special items outlined in today's press release. ADI delivered strong first quarter with results at the high end of our outlook. Revenue increased 20% nearing an all-time high, operating margin expanded to 40.7% in line with our long-term model and adjusted EPS grew 40%. We saw tremendous breadth this quarter with all market segments growing year-over-year. The first time in over three years. And B2B revenue increased 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year with double-digit growth across each end market. Industrial represented 55% of revenue during the quarter increased 5% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. This represented a record quarter for industrial with broad based strength across applications, customers and geographies. Specifically demand across our automation instrumentation and energy businesses accelerated this quarter. Communications which represented 18% of revenue during the quarter decreased 10% sequentially but increased 16% year-over-year. Both wireless and wireline revenue grew double-digit despite zero revenue from Huawei this quarter. Automotive which represented 16% of revenue increased 7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. With the industry aggressively ramping up production we saw double-digit year-over-year across all applications. BMS exhibited the highest growth, a trend we expect to continue given our growing design pipeline. And lastly, consumer which represented 11% of revenue increased 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in hearables, wearables and home entertainment. This quarter's inflection puts us on track to return to full year growth in 2021. And now for the rest of the P&L, gross margin which is seasonally weaker in the first quarter finished flat sequentially at 78%. We anticipate our first quarter's gross margin will be the trough for the year as we benefit from a strong top line, improving utilization and capturing the majority of the LTC cost savings. OpEx in the quarter was $456 million up sequentially and year-over-year due mainly to variable compensation. Op margins finished at 40.7% above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $27 million and better than our outlook due to an investment gain. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. So all told, adjusted EPS came in above the high end of guidance at $1.44. This included a $0.04 benefit from an investment gain that was not in our prior outlook. Moving onto balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars increased modestly while inventory days finished at 119, down from 121 in the fourth quarter. Channel inventory as measured in weeks was flat sequentially and remained well below our seven-to-eight-week target. CapEx in the quarter increased to $67 million or roughly 4% of sales. We're working judiciously to add CapEx to meet this record demand anticipate that CapEx will run slightly above our long-term target of 4% for fiscal 2021. Turning to cash flow, over the trailing 12 months we generated $1.9 billion or 33% of revenue. You'll recall that during the last year, we paused our share repurchase program for few quarters due to the pandemic and our proposed Maxim acquisition. Therefore in 2020, we returned 80% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments. This quarter, we've reinstated our share repurchase program and given our current 1.5 leverage ratio we're committed to returning 100% of free cash flow for the year. Looking at the first quarter, we executed nearly $160 million of repo and we also announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend at $0.69 per share. Which marks our 18th increase over the last 17 years? Before moving onto guidance, I want to provide some context on the current state of supply. A sharper than expected recovery in the economy coupled with a lean inventory backdrop is fueling unprecedented demand for semiconductors and putting stress on the global supply chain. While the industry at large is aggressively working to meet this historic demand. It's more than likely we'll be operating in a constrained supply environment for the balance of the year. At ADI, we're confident in our ability to outperform in times like this. Our flexible hybrid manufacturing model, healthy balance sheet inventory and diversified product and customer base position us well. In addition, we're working to secure additional capacity from our external partners and ramping our internal operations to increase output. Now let me provide our second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.6 billion plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint, this guidance reflects would be record revenue. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth for automotive, industrial and consumer market but we do see a decline in our comms. Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be 41% plus or minus 70 bps and our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS will be $1.44 plus or minus $0.08. So in summary I'm encouraged by the near-term trend we're seeing across our end markets and while we're mindful of the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. We're optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway and with Maxim expected to close this summer. 2021 will be a transformative year for ADI. Let me now pass it back to Mike to start our Q&A. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks Prashanth. Let's go to the Q&A session. We ask that limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question please requeue and we'll take your question, if time allows. With that, Cheryl can we have our first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Good morning, guys. Appreciate the question and congratulations on the strong results. Prashanth, I just want to talk a little bit about how the model unfolds from here. I mean clearly you talked about already hitting the gross margin trough for the year. But you're guiding EPS sort of flattish on op revenue. I'm just kind of curious how should we be thinking about OpEx from current run rate levels and specifically, is there incremental OpEx needed because of the tight supply situation? What are the puts and takes as we go throughout the balance of the year? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you for the question, John. Way to think about OpEx is that, if you recall in the Proxy, we identified that last year in the first half we had a particularly low bonus payout as reflection of the macroeconomic environment. In the first half of this year you're going to see the opposite effect of that. So on average it's a normal bonus payout. But you do see a significant upswing in a variable comp for which is impacting both the first and the second quarter compares. In addition, we have the merit increase if you remember we put that merit increase in several months later than normal as a result of the pandemic last year. So you're beginning to see that on a full year run rate basis in first quarter and then it will carry in second quarter. So beyond these comp related items OpEx is really at a steady level. We're not requiring any additional investment at the OpEx level to support the demand that we're generating. John Pitzer : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks. We'll have our next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ambrish Srivastava : Prashanth and Vince, I just wanted to get back to the current constrained supply condition that the industry is facing. So could you please comment on your lead times and then what are you seeing in the cost increases as you're experiencing and are you able to pass along pricing through the customers and more importantly, does it change your approach? Is there a structural change that you see happening? Prashanth, you talked about CapEx running a little bit higher. Where does that additional CapEx going? Is back end, front end? And I just wanted to get a better sense of how things change from here on the supply chain front for ADI? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Okay, so there's a lot packed into that question, Ambrish. Let me take a couple pieces of it. So we're producing and shipping at record levels and second quarter outlook is going to be a record. We have enough capacity to meet to the guide. But significant additional upside versus that guide will depend on what we're able to procure both from an external wafer standpoint as well as the capital that we're in the process of deploying into our internal facilities to support that. What we're doing to help alleviate that situation is we have been consistently building inventory since last summer to deplete what was pulled down during the pandemic shutdowns. We're adding additional supply both internally and I mentioned the capital that we're deploying which is mostly going to the back end and then externally we've gone out and acquired additional wafers from our partners. I think the answer to your question on CapEx is that is mostly for test and then, on the capacity side. Where we can get additional capacity from our partners, we're doing that. But even with this additional capacity it's very likely that the strength of demand is going to outpace supply for some period of time. So I think we will be chasing demand at least for the balance of this year. From a capital deployment standpoint, some of that as we guide as percentage of revenue some of that is dependent on how strong the year continues to rollout. So when I say slightly above 4%. It could come down to 4% or maybe just a hair below if revenue continues to cripple on here. Vince Roche : Yes, just on the lead time question, Ambrish. So we entered our first quarter with what we've recalled normal lead times. But during the quarter and into the early part of this quarter we've seen lead times extend which I think is pretty consistent with the industry at large. So while we see some hot spots. We're really talking about is few weeks of extension in different places. Let me remind you too that, we run this company. We run our manufacturing plants; the operating plants are run to POS rather than POA. So what we're seeing right now is a good balance between POS and POA. But as Prashanth said, we're preparing for quite a bit of upside during this year and we've pretty substantially increased the CapEx in our backend. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks Ambrish. Go to next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stacy Rasgon : I wanted to ask about comm. So it's down sequentially and year-over-year I guess into Q2. Is that the trough for the year for comm.? And do you think the comms segment overall can grow year-over-year for the full year 2021? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: You want to take that, Vince? Okay, I'll take the first part of that, Stacy. So let's break comms into wired and wireless. On the wired, we're looking for continued growth as carriers and data centers are upgrading networks. On the wireless, we said that, that the US deployment of 5G was always going to be a second half event and our view on that has not changed. What we have seen is a bit more of a slowdown in China as they're digesting kind of the 5G that they deployed and the channel counts are a bit lower. So we do think comms troughs in second quarter and then begins to pick up in the second half with the global 5G. In terms of our view on whether we can grow comms on a year-over-year basis. Given the significant headwind we have from Huawei going to zero, that's a tough ask. Vince Roche : Yes, I think as well, I'll remind everybody that the three-year CAGR for comms has been 7% and that's with that's very, very significant headwind in China. I think when you look at ADI in the comms business it's tremendously diverse. Many, many hundreds of customers. 5G is a critical part. Wireline is an increasingly critical part. So very, very hard to predict in a lumpy business. But our expectation is that, when you have CAGR [indiscernible] we produce better than mid single-digit growth for that business. Stacy Rasgon : I'm sorry, was that a long-term statement? That didn't sound like that was this year. Vince Roche : Over the next few years I think Stacy. We will produce something better than mid single-digit growth in that business. Mike Lucarelli : Yes, Stacy what Prashanth says we don't think it will grow this year in fiscal 2021 due to, I will say the Huawei headwinds, as they go to zero and lower channel count in China. But then pivoting to Vince, over the long-term we should grow - we've been growing 7%. There's no reason to go - going forward we can't grow at least in line to that. Stacy Rasgon : Didn't you used to talk about double-digit growth in this business? Mike Lucarelli : We did Stacy. I think the world has changed over the past two years quite a bit. Could it grow double-digit? Sure it could. There's no reason it can't. But I think as we look today with the pressures, you're seeing geopolitically those are things we didn't know two years ago. Vince Roche : I think high single digits is a reasonable expectation. The early stages of 5G, I think being able to grow at double digits pretty plausible but we're working off a bigger numerator at this point in time. So I think if we can produce something in the high single digits. We'll be in very, very good shape. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Thank you, guys. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks Stacy. Cheryl, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Vince, you talked about second design win for your wireless BMS solution or second OEM using that technology. Could you elaborate a little bit on how quickly this technology is going to penetrate the auto market? Could you potentially get to six, seven OEMs embracing this technology this year and or next? Vince Roche : Well that's certainly our expectation. I think in terms of getting to market. The latter part of this year we'll see the start of production. And I think between now and the end of 2023 say, we should expect four to five OEMs to adopt that technology. With a strong pipeline, but also remember we have a very strong wired portfolio in BMS. So we've got those two tailwinds working for us. But I think overtime it will be kind of hybrid between wired and wireless. But clearly wireless is the bright star at this point in time and our expectation is, that we'll have at least a handful of OEMs using this technology by start of 2024. Tore Svanberg : Very helpful. Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks Tore. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Vince, I wanted to talk about just fiscal 2021 and the sustainability of growth. So you're starting the year of very strong, right? 20% growth rates in Q1 and the Q2 outlook. How should we think about the second half of other - do you want to talk about the fiscal year or the calendar year? Which markets do you think right now are over heated because of whatever reasons which are kind of only - which are in line with demand and which ones can actually accelerate going into the second half? Just how should we think about how the segment mix changes as you go towards the second half of the year? Thank you. Vince Roche : Thanks for your question. Typically 1Q is the low point for ADI. We had a reasonably strong first Q compared to kind of normal pattern. But I want to stress there's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there. And I don't want to get into the business of making strong speculative predictions here. But we can only kind of guide one quarter at a time particularly in this varying market. But if I look at the markets and just kind of peel the story back a little bit for you. So our industrial business which represents about half of the company's revenue was down we had two consecutive down years in 2019 and 2020. But we produced the record quarter in the first. We expect ongoing strength in that business and one thing I'm very, very pleased about is that the most diverse part of our industrial business is automation and I think given the strength of our opportunity pipeline, the new products we've got coming to market. I expect to see a multi-year tailwind in the automation part. I think right now in automotive there's a big push to electric vehicles and I see that as I said in the prepared remarks that is expected to grow by 2030 from kind of 7 million deployed electric vehicles today to over 200 million by 2030. And we talked a lot last quarter about the strength of our cabin electronics business, active noise cancelation, premium audio, our A2B bus deployments and all that through provides good tailwinds for the company going ahead. Comms as we've just narrated weak in the first half of 2021. But really, I think that's about the timing of deployments and my expectation is that, that business would snuck back in the second half of 2021 and continue into 2022. Last but not least, our consumer business has shown our couple of sequential growth quarters and we no longer have the overhang of one big socket and one big customer. So with the diversity of our business. We were addressing more applications, we've a stronger product portfolio than we've had say three years ago. I think we're on a growth track of that business and we're certainly off to a very, very good start. So we believe that 2020 was bottom of that business and certainly the signals are that is the case. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks Vivek. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Vince, you guys talked about growing capacity both internally as well as externally with your foundry partners. How should we think about the step up in your capacity, again both internal and external, over the next couple of quarters? The magnitude at which you can grow capacity for the overall business? And secondly, a couple of your peers have talked about signing long-term contracts with customers. Is that something that ADI is thinking about or considering? Thank you. Vince Roche : Well, I think what you've got to remember is that first and foremost we're producing and shipping products at record levels. 2Q will be an all-time record for the company, so we're certainly keeping ahead. Our investments are keeping ahead of these revenue levels, obviously. Like most of our peers in the industry, there are supply constraints in parts of the business, so we're not able to meet all of the demand, particularly in auto, which has been very, very well-publicized. And the constraints continue across the front end in wafer procurement and also the backend. But I want to remind you, too, we produce about half our silicon inside ADI, and the other half we procure with external partners. So I think something else worth noting is that we've been building inventory since last summer in terms of die stock and finished goods, which was heavily depleted during the pandemic shutdown. So, as I said, internally we're ramping up our own manufacturing operations and we've been successful in acquiring additional wafers from our external partners. So I think that's the best I can give you in terms of the atmosphere that we're working within. We're certainly keeping CapEx deployments ahead of where we think the revenue could be this year based on the demand patterns we now see. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Toshi, I would expect that our guide for each of the subsequent quarters is going to be partly influenced by what we're able to supply. So as I said earlier, I think we're going to be chasing demand for the rest of this fiscal year, and we will use our guidance range to inform how we think - what we can build to base on our ability to get capacity third parties as well as increase capacity internally. Toshiya Hari : And then the long-term contracts, is that something that comes up in conversations or not really? Vince Roche : I think it depends. We do have long-term contracts, but we're doing that on a more strategic basis than tactical, let's say. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thank you so much. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Toshiya. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Craig Hettenbach : Any update on just the linear cross selling synergies and efforts? I know a little while back you talked about the pipeline, but just how you're seeing that kind of unfold? And any particular markets for product segments that you're seeing the most traction along those lines? Vince Roche : Yes, so, Craig, there's a couple of ways to look at this. Obviously, the battery side of things is very, very strong. We've more than doubled the size of that since we acquired LT. And overall, when I look at, for example, power, the mixed signal portfolio, as well as the battery management side of things, we have more than $500 million worth of new revenue going into production this year, and that's just the beginning. So in terms of areas where we're winning, we've got notable wins in communications, in wireless as well as and data center and cloud. In Automotive, we're strongly attaching to our infotainment business, the autonomous radar systems. And the strongest surge in terms of growth in industrial for the LT portfolio, the additional cross selling is instrumentation tests and micromodules generally speaking across the board. We're seeing very, very strong demand for those products. So I think all that said, we had expected that we would double the LTC growth from 3% to 4% historically to high single digits in a five-year period. And that's quite similar to how we viewed our opportunity with Hittite at the beginning and what also has materialized. So that's the story in terms of the markets and the expected growth. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks, Vince. Mike Lucarelli : Cheryl, can we have our last question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from C. J. Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. C. J. Muse: I guess, Vince, to follow-up on that last question and to kind of go back to what you talked about a quarter ago. I think you said factory automation turned positive for the first time in quite a while year-on-year yet was still significantly below the Q3, 2018 levels. So I was hoping we could level set where we are today in your industrial bucket. And as you think about where you are relative to prior peak, what kind of acceleration in growth should we be able to see in 2021 and 2022 particularly around factory automation, A&D and instrumentation? Vince Roche : I'd say I mean, just Mike can give you some numerical color. I'll just give you a couple headline here. So what we're seeing, as I said in the prepared remarks, is an acceleration of the market in general, but we're still well below the previous peak. And given the pipeline of opportunities that we've got, the technologies and the products that we've got, I think the long-term trends are going to be very, very strong, accelerated of course by the obvious need for resilience and driven by automation as a result of the pandemic. But, Mike, you might want to add? Mike Lucarelli : Yes, sure. C. J., you're right. If you look at our Industrial business, we did just achieve a record quarter and we're guiding to another record quarter. So I'll clarify that. But what's interesting is if you peel back a bit, we have six application areas within industrial. Only two of them are above previous peaks. So there's a lot more room for upside across all the verticals. But even if you look back at previous peaks, there's still four application areas we still have more room to run before we hit those peaks. Automation being one of those as well. So I think, as Vince said, it's a long-term growth market, automation and industrial, and you're starting to see that business turn late last year into this year. And I think that continues hopefully into 2022. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Maybe just to close on that, C. J., we've been gaining share in industrial, and we've been gaining share over the last couple of years while the market hasn't been as strong. Now you're going to see the compounding effect of a growing market with the benefits of the share that we've picked up. So I think you will see significant outperformance for ADI's industrial business versus our peers over the balance of this year. Vince Roche : I think healthcare as well, C.J., is worth noting that it still remains considerably above pre-COVID levels. We obviously got a boost during the upsurge in COVID-19. And again, I think this has been growing at 10% for the past five or seven years. I think, a multi-year growth market, and we're beginning to see also the acceleration of demand as a result of the pandemic getting healthcare capabilities to anywhere so to speak. So I think - we look across industrial as an area where we've been, I'd say, steering a lot of our R&D over the last decade or so. It's kind of a long burn business, but we're seeing the benefits now in terms of strength of our technology pipe and our customer engagements. C. J. Muse: Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : All right. Thanks, C.J., and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on the website. Thanks for joining the call and your continued interest in Analog Devices.

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Mike Lucarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mike Lucarelli : Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. Now onto the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q and other periodic reports and materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vince Roche : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. So I'm very pleased to share with you that we delivered record revenue and earnings in the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our outlook.  This strength was driven by our disciplined operational execution and our ability to capture the value presented as our solutions become more vital in the modern digital economy. The supply and demand dynamics in our industry have been well publicized. Broadly speaking, the economic recovery has materialized faster and stronger than initially anticipated, placing unprecedented stress on supply chains globally. Late last year, ADI moved with speed and agility, proactively making capital investments to add capacity, positioning us to navigate this disruption and better serve our customers. That said, we, like many others in the industry, will face a supply constrained environment through the balance of 2021. Despite this backdrop, we're positioned for a strong second half as our continued capital investments are aligned with robust demand. Moving to a summary of our results. Revenue was $1.66 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year. The strength was broad based, highlighted by record quarters for our industrial and automotive markets. Gross margin expanded to nearly 71% and operating margin to approximately 42%. Adjusted EPS of $1.54 increased 43% year-over-year.  Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow. This equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very proud how the ADI team executed this quarter to deliver these impressive results.  At ADI, innovation is the root of how we generate value. And to maintain our virtuous cycle of innovation driven success, we invest more than $1 billion in R&D annually. This commitment coupled with the diversity of our business across customers, products and applications, positions us to deliver long-term profitable growth. Now let me share a few customer highlights with you. ADI solutions are embedded across the electrification ecosystem from developing and managing the vehicle battery to the distribution and storage across the digital grid. With the rapid shift to EVs, we're seeing new and increasing investments in battery manufacturing capacity.  This quarter, we secured a design win with the supplier of one of the world's top battery producers. Our innovative solution reduces system cost by half by integrating all measurement, control and diagnostics functions. And our portfolio of wired and wireless BMS provides unmatched accuracy to deliver market leading vehicle range as we grow and diversify our BMS business. This quarter, we added Volvo as well as three additional large auto manufacturers, including a prominent luxury brand in Europe and two leading brands in Asia.  Moving on to energy infrastructure. Here, energy storage systems are required to make renewable energy a reality and to build the charging infrastructure to support EV proliferation. Our precision Signal Chain Power management and BMS portfolios delivered the level of accuracy necessary to ensure a consistent supply across the digital grid. We have design wins of more than 80% of the top customers, from traditional energy and industrial companies to new entrants. Another area of increasing importance for ADI\u2019s connectivity, which of course is becoming more pervasive across demographics and industries, presenting new opportunities for us. For example, in our communications business, we announced the complete radio platform for the 5G O-RAN ecosystem. This radio platform builds on our market leading integrated transceiver position by expanding into the digital frontend.  Our full system solution enables significant size and performance improvements, while reducing customers\u2019 design cycles. O-RAN represents a new vector of growth in the communications market by enabling new entrance and applications, such as private networks that support connected factories. In addition to the partnerships with Intel and Marvell, we are working with key carriers and system integrators to enable this ecosystem.  In our space business, our beamforming solution will be used in Telesat Lightspeed LEO satellite constellation scheduled to launch in late 2023. This win speaks to the breadth and depth of our RF portfolio and domain expertise at ADI, which is supporting the adoption broadly of LEO communication satellites.  Additionally, we continue to have strong design momentum across our diversified industrial market, the largest, stickiest and most profitable business at ADI. Over the years, we've established a heritage of providing the most precise and efficient solutions required by our factory automation customers.  I believe we're at a tipping point in Industrial 4.0 as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing, and connectivity to make supply chains more robust, more efficient and flexible. We recently won an ultra-high frequency wireless solution at a key automation company. Our solution is being used in advanced robotic systems to reduce downtime and costs.  On the wired side, customers are beginning to upgrade to deterministic Ethernet to ensure machines are constantly connected and monitored. This quarter, we secured numerous design wins for a robust Ethernet solution, including two of the largest European industrial machine manufacturers.  We recently hosted a deep dive on our instrumentation and test business. This is truly a performance-driven market that requires ADI\u2019s most advanced technology and solutions, making it a great fit for our high-performance precision Signal Chain Power and RF portfolios.  Our broad diverse instrumentation business comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments is aligned with all secular growth trends across our industry.  The increasing complexity of these applications is driving the need for solutions with more advanced technology capabilities. As a result, we expect our SEM to increase by over 20% in the next five years. Now these examples represent only a fraction of the incredible work across ADI.  Our team is partnering with our customers everyday to develop increasingly innovative technologies that not only create successful business outcomes, but also enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world.  To that end, I wanted to share an exciting update on how we're leveraging innovation to advance our mission of Engineering Good. In April, we launched an innovation accelerator with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. As part of this program, we'll be combining ADI\u2019s engineers and technologies with WHOI\u2019s science and technology platforms to continuously monitor critical oceanographic conditions. This effort supports our overall climate agenda, which includes our commitments to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.  We also published our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report last week, which provides additional information on how our technologies will continue to play a major role in improving our standard of living, while protecting our planetary health. So in closing, the last year has underscored how semiconductors as the bedrock of the modern digital economy and information age are increasingly important to accelerating digitalization across all industries. We're encouraged by our results this quarter, and the momentum in our pipeline sets the stage for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. So with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth who will take you through the financial details. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.  ADI delivered a record second quarter as revenue, operating margin and EPS finished above the high end of our outlook. As I mentioned last quarter, upside to our second quarter outlook would be predicated on our ability to increase production. And thanks to early strategic investments in capacity, as well as strong execution by our manufacturing operations team, we did just that.  Now let's look at performance by end market. Industrial represented 59% of revenue and increased 14% sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. This quarter marks the second consecutive all-time high for industrial. We saw strength across all applications and geographies, with all sub-segments growing double digits sequentially and year-over-year.  Communications represented 17% of revenue, fell slightly sequentially and was flat year-over-year. Wireline increased double digits year-over-year, which balanced softness in wireless. As we outlined in the last call, 5G builds have been muted year-to-date. However, we anticipate momentum to pick up as 5G deployments broadened globally in the second half of this year, especially in North America, now that the C-band auction is complete. Automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 5% sequentially, and 42% year-over-year. Again, we saw double digit growth across every major application as industry production has picked up notably from a year ago. BMS grew the fastest, more than doubling year-over-year.  And lastly, consumer decreased 12% sequentially in the seasonally weaker second quarter and represented 9% of revenue. Importantly, consumer grew 8% year-over-year, positioning us to deliver growth in fiscal '21. Now covering the rest of the P&L, gross margin finished just under 71%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 320 basis points year-over-year on higher utilization and better product mix. We expect additional gross margin expansion in the second half as we realize savings from the consolidation of our manufacturing operations.  OpEx in the quarter was 484 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Merit increases went into effect during the second quarter and we also recorded higher variable comp due to the strong results.  This netted operating margin of 41.7%, non-op expenses were 44 million, down nearly 10% from the prior year driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate was approximately 12%. And all-in, adjusted EPS of $1.54 exceeded the high end of our outlook and marks an all-time high.  Now moving on to the balance sheet. Relative to the first quarter, inventory dollars increased 23 million to a record 641 million. This increase was driven entirely by raw material and work-in process, as we wrap utilization to better meet the strong customer demand. Days of inventory were relatively unchanged at 118.  Weeks of channel inventory finished lower sequentially once again. And due to the strong sell-through at our distys, we anticipate remaining below our seven to eight-week target through the end of the year.  CapEx for the quarter was 59 million, bringing our year-to-date total to 127 million or more than double compared to the second half of 2020. We expect to continue to increase capital investment and for CapEx to trend above our long-term model of 4% this year. Turning to cash flow, we generated 2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, which equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin. And over the same period, we returned approximately 75% of free cash flow after debt repayments via dividends and repos. This is below our long-term target as we paused our buyback program, given the pandemic uncertainty and the pending Maxim deal. We ended the second quarter with 1.3 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet and our net leverage is now 1.3 on a trailing 12. We\u2019re comfortable with the leverage and do not plan to reduce debt. As such, we remain committed to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.  So let me finish up with our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be 1.7 billion plus or minus 70 million, up sequentially as additional capacity comes online. This is in line with seasonality after a very strong Q2. At the midpoint, we expect each of our B2B markets to increase slightly sequentially, and consumer to be up low double digits. Based on the midpoint of guide, op margin is expected to be 42.5 plus or minus 100 bps. And our tax rate is expected to fall between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.61 plus or minus $0.11.  So in summary, ADI delivered a very strong quarter highlighted by record revenue, earnings and free cash flow conversion. Importantly, bookings and backlog remain very strong and we're continuing to invest to increase production for the balance of the year, giving us great confidence that our second half will be stronger than our first. We've also made meaningful progress towards closing the Maxim acquisition. Shortly after the deal closes, we are going to hold a conference call to provide an update regarding our capital return plans. As a reminder, once combined, we anticipate having more than $3 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below 1.  Let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&A. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Let's go to the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question, please requeue and we'll take questions if time allows.  With that, Cheryl, can we have our first question please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Yes. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Vince, Prashanth, 90 days ago when you sort of guided for the April quarter, the key gating factor was your ability to grow supply. I'm curious, as you look at the July quarter, are you still in a supply constrained environment? And I guess more importantly, given the internal CapEx you\u2019re spending and your work with your foundry partners, how do we think about your ability to grow supply beyond sort of the July quarter guidance? Vince Roche : Yes. So, John, thanks for the question. Yes, we are constrained. We've got a very, very positive book to build. But what we have forecast for the July quarter factors in all the elements of supply across silicon supply, both internally, externally as well as all the backend operations, assembly and test. So we feel very confident in that number. But beyond that, there is opportunity to ship more. There is more demand out there. But at least in the July quarter, we feel very comfortable with what we have forecast. John Pitzer : And how do we think about supply growth beyond July? Is July a good proxy to what you should be able to do sequentially for the next couple of quarters, or are you getting a particularly strong uplift in July and things moderate going forward? Vince Roche : Well, I think -- ultimately, everything will depend on demand. We're increasing our capacity. We're getting more wafer supply in general. And we are, as Prashanth said in his remarks, we've been investing in capital equipment inside the company to expand our backend operations. So you'll see sequential improvements in ADI\u2019s output over the coming months. So as Prashanth said, the second half of the year, given our confidence in supply, we will have a better second half than first half. John Pitzer : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, John. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the record results. Prashanth, you talked about just the inventory being sort of way below the seven to eight-week target. Could you tell us where exactly the numbers are right now? And also, do you expect to get back to seven to eight at some point or is this kind of like a new norm now where disty in the channel is going to be sort of running below at what it has historically? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks, Tore. Inventory is very lean. We entered the quarter below seven weeks and it decreased again in the quarter. So we would like to build inventory backup. It's unlikely that that's going to happen. Whatever they get their hands on sells through immediately. So until the supply gets improved over the coming quarters, I don't think you'll see us return to normal inventory levels in the channel. But I would say that we do maintain the view that sort of that seven to eight weeks is the right balance for us to have in the channel. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Tore. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Vince or Prashanth, I was hoping you could quantify lead times and book to build in various end markets to the extent possible, where are lead times stretched the most? And importantly, what are you doing to prevent double ordering? Are you implementing any firm price, non-cancelable programs like some of your peers are? Any perspective on how do we quantify the state of supply/demand imbalance and how do we get some assurance that this will be resolved I guess peacefully is one word that comes to mind, I think that will be very helpful? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vivek. Maybe just to start with some comments on where demand is coming from. So we're experiencing significant growth in demand and it's very broad based in all of our markets. And when you rewind and think how we got here, our customers entered the pandemic with pretty lean inventories. Then we had this synchronized government stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. We had very strong growth during the pandemic of consumer electronics with the high use of cloud compute connectivity. We're coming out of the pandemic now with GDP driving industrial, and that's driving companies to rethink both where they manufacture and upgrading the style by which they manufacture. So on the supply side, we've been planning for additional capacity, as Vince mentioned, since late summer of 2020. And as we add capacity, our revenue forecast is increasing. And that's really what helped us deliver a better Q2 guide up for Q3 and feel good about Q4. So I think supply will eventually match demand, but I don't see demand really going away. So this feels -- given the secular drivers behind it, it feels that this is going to be with us for a while. Book to build for the past quarter was above 1, and it was the same for all end markets. So it's, again, very broad based. And I think it's really just a reflection of the incredible role that ADI\u2019s products play across the manufacturing ecosystem. Vivek Arya : And any pricing programs that you might have put in place like your peers? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I guess a few comments to make there. We are efficiently managing our orders. We're working with our customers, both large and small, across all markets to understand the demand timing and to allocate the supply based on demand. Remember that while we report on a POA basis, we actually run the business on POS. So we look through distribution to understand what's happening at customer. We've also put in a non-cancelable, non-returnable for up to 90 days to help give us better visibility into the backlog and that helps customers sort of manage what they can expect to get from us. So at this point, I would say the focus really has been on communication. And that's the feedback I think Vince has heard from customers as well is that what's important to them is communicating what they're going to get and when they're going to get it, so they can plan their respective downstream production requirements. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Vivek. We\u2019ll go to the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much, Prashanth and Vince. I wanted to just unpack the gross margin comments that you made, Prashanth. You are at the model 70% plus and when you talk about gross margin incrementally getting better, what's the right way to think about it? You had referred to the cost savings that you'll be getting from factory consolidation. Is there an impact from pricing? And then kind of -- and related to that, how are you managing the input cost, which seem to be going up across the board versus pricing? And is that also playing a factor in the gross margin? And sorry, related to that is would you be building inventory as you go through the second half? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Ambrish. Do you have a few more add-ons to that? So let's start with -- let's do a quick one on, on pricing. So net impact of pricing changes are immaterial to gross margin. So we're managing our cost increases to net those out from a price standpoint. The gross margin lift that you're seeing really is the productivity that we're driving. So I did say in the first quarter earnings call that that would be the bottom of gross margins for the year and we would expect sequential improvement. You're seeing that in the Q2 results printed. You see that in the guide that we've given for Q3. That is coming from the manufacturing consolidation of the linear factory closure, which we have talked about, and also some step-up in utilization. So that's kind of a tactical way to think about how gross margins with evolved over the balance of this year. Our model remains 70%. And I don't know, Vince, if you want to give some guide on how we think about gross margins long term? Vince Roche : Yes. Look, the root of our value creation really is innovation. We're spending over $1 billion a year. And we like to have the highest performing products out there that we got well paid for. And I think also the diversity of our product application and customer domains helps us protect margins, as we've seen through the pandemic here. So 85% -- we've got 125,000 customers and 85% of our sales comes from products that individually contribute less than 0.1% of our revenue, or even less. So that's the model of the company. So there's a lot of resilience -- a lot of optionality and resilience built into it. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Ambrish. Ambrish Srivastava : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Blayne Curtis : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Just kind of curious on the industrial segment. I think last quarter you talked about two of six segments being at peak. You talked about all being up in the April quarter. So just any color by segment there and if any more of them are at record revenue, that would be helpful? Thanks. Vince Roche : Yes. Well, we've seen -- this is a very, very highly diversified business. We saw broad growth across all the individual sectors. In fact, all applications grew double digits year- over-year and sequentially. And I believe there's a lot more upside to come, because we're in a multiyear growth cycle driven by secular trends, Industry 4.0, et cetera. I would say the -- we've seen really strong acceleration in the automation sector. And I think that's driven by such things as the need for onshoring, more flexibility and more robust and connected supply chains. If I just pick healthcare, it has already been a multiyear growth market for ADI. And the pandemic kind of underscored the importance of information technology in managing our healthcare systems. So we've seen an acceleration in our digital healthcare business, as we begin to migrate the hospital environment to the clinic and the home with point of care solutions or healthcare anywhere mentality. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, the energy sector with the move through renewables and this charging infrastructure that's being laid in to support these electric vehicles, those are some of the areas that we're seeing strongest growth within the industrial area. But I think automation underpins it. Also, I would say, I've been very pleased with the results that we're getting in the very broad bench, scientific and test equipment, analytics equipment, and so on. So it's been very, very broad. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And Blayne, just to touch on your last point about the record applications. You're right. I think last quarter, two or three had records. We increased that. Four of our six applications are at record. So I think I echo what Vince said is that we're early stages of this cycle. And yes, at some point, we expect all of our applications to be at record probably next year or so. And with that, can we go to our next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Vince, I had a multipart question on your BMS business. You guys talked about revenue more than doubling in the quarter. I was hoping you could speak to kind of the breadth of your customer profile there on the quarter on a year-over-year basis. And I guess more importantly, based on some of the comments that you've made on past calls and also this call as it relates to your design win pipeline, should we expect some of these wireless BMS projects to ramp in fiscal '22 or is it more fiscal '23 and beyond? And lastly, as it pertains to the combination with Maxim, how should we think about how your position in BMS evolves over time post the combination? Thank you. Vince Roche : Yes. Thanks, Toshi. Well, first off, we're the market share leader in the electric vehicle battery management systems. And as you know, we have really two portfolios. We have the existing, we like to call it the wired portfolio, the more traditional way of moving data from the battery system and we've introduced a wireless version, a robust cognitive radio-based wireless system. So I think the next 12 months will be driven by the traditional wired battery technology. And after that in late '22 into 2023, we\u2019ll begin to see the upsurge of the wireless battery technology that will complement the wired. So what I believe will happen is, today, what have we got? 2 million, 3 million cars per year being produced -- electric vehicles being produced. That's going to move to we believe somewhere 10x at least over the next seven, eight years. So this is a multiyear cycle. Where our BMS chips today are being used in over half of the top 10 selling EV cars globally, and we're getting share in each of those areas. Today, our best position is in North America and China. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're beginning to make real tracks in Europe as well as Japan and Korea. So, ultimately, if a manufacturer wants the most miles per charge, they're going to turn to ADI. So that's what we're working on. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Toshiya. We\u2019ll go to our next question please. Cheryl, we'll take our next question. Cheryl? Vince Roche : Cheryl, can you hear us? Operator : Please go ahead Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank, your line is open. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Vince Roche : Yes, we can, Ross. Ross Seymore : Okay, great. Glad Cheryl came back. Just had a couple of questions on your communications business. I guess in the tactical sense, it looked like it was better than you expected in the quarter, the April quarter. Was that specific to the wired or wireless side, or was it just the supply coming on? And then more importantly, looking forward, can you give a little bit more color on what your expectations are for the wireless side? Obviously, we had some difficult comps with what happened with Huawei year-over-year, but how do we think about that returning to year-over-year growth, given the second half commentary that you talked about with some ramps in North America and beyond? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks. So I said in the prepared remarks that the communications business for the second quarter was really driven by very strong growth in the wired. I think it was up double digits. Wireless remains lumpy. But we feel pretty good that comms has bottomed in the second quarter and we're going to see growth in the second half, and I'll let Vince jump in with some of the customer conversations he's been having. But with the completion of the C-band auction, we feel very good that you're now going to see the build out of 5G for which we are the largest participant certainly with the transceiver product for both the U.S. and starting to see that in Europe as well. Vince Roche : Yes. So Ross, what I want to mention is that at this point in time the rest of world is 3x larger than China for ADI. I think that's very, very important to remember. And we're certainly seeing 5G momentum pick up on a global basis. North America, we've recently -- obviously, the C-band auction is complete. And we're beginning to see orders today that we expect will accelerate during 2022 and beyond. Even Europe, where there's been real lethargy in upgrading their communication systems in general over the last several years, we're beginning to see signs of life in the deployment of 5G. India is also -- India has a significant government funded program to make 5G a reality there. We\u2019re beginning to participate in trials. And last but not least is O-RAN. We already have revenue as a company with Rakuten, the online shopping company in Japan and we're very well positioned given our ecosystem position there to unlock potential in what is a brand new stream of revenue, particularly I think as it gets deployed into private networks for machines. Ross Seymore : Great. Prashanth, just one quick clarification. Double digits in the wired, was that a year-over-year or a sequential comment? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: That was a year-over-year. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to follow up on that comm question. So if I go back to last quarter, you'd kind of talked the comm trajectory down a bit and it was a China statement. So I just want to clarify. Is that -- it doesn't sound like that's changed. It does sound like the uptick you're seeing right now is outside of China, U.S., Europe, India. I guess is that correct? I guess why didn't you see that uptick 90 days ago -- expectations for that uptick 90 days ago versus today? And then what are your broad thoughts on 5G rollout in China going forward from here? How does the rest of that play out given all the dynamics that are happening there? Vince Roche : Yes. So I think first and foremost, China's opportunistic for ADI at this point. We will sell I think lots of components, and therefore it is more opportunistic. Prashanth, you can talk about the specifics. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. I think, Stacy, we have always said that we expected 5G deployments in North America to come next and be followed by Europe. When we gave you the commentary for the -- leaning into the second quarter, we were focused on the pause in China. But we have seen now that the auctions are complete, and particularly Verizon being much more public about what they intend to do in the 5G space, as Vince mentioned, orders are starting to come in for that. So the trajectory for communications or for wireless specifically is going to be up in the second half. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Can we go to our last question please? Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from William Stein from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. William Stein : Great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Guys, I'd like to ask about the cost function. We have two potential looming problems. I think one is inflation broadly, not just materials, potentially labor as well. And then on the OpEx side, the return to work face-to-face sort of operations suggest maybe we start spending on travel and things like that. And I wonder if you can comment as to how we might sensitize our models to these factors? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So let me take the inflation piece first. So I think it was Ambrish who asked a question and we are seeing cost increases from our supply base, but we feel that we're guiding margins on a net basis are going to be neutral for that, because we are where we can pushing that price through. So I'm not as concerned about the inflation side. We have been very mindful of the labor side. And I would say that the data we're seeing is that it's taking us about a week longer than normal to fill jobs at the factory level. So our U.S. factories are facing a little bit longer time to fill jobs, but it's not anywhere as dramatic as what we're hearing in the media in terms of filling these high paying manufacturing jobs. And then for return to office, that is something we spend a lot of time on. There is no doubt that there will be some return to travel. I think that's going to be universal across all companies. But more specifically to how ADI is thinking about return to office, maybe I'll let Vince talk about how we're thinking about that. Vince Roche : Yes. So we've instituted a three-day per week policy to start with here at ADI for those who have been working remotely, and we will see where things go from there. But my sense is on the OpEx side of things, we will probably not get back to per capita travel spend, entertainment spend and so on and so forth. The other thing I'll remind you, Will, is that we work relentlessly at the company on taking costs out of the business. So we work hard on cost of goods, we work hard on making the business efficient below the cost of goods line as well. So inflation is nothing new. We'll see how it moves over the next -- if we see an acceleration in inflation, then we'll figure out what actions to take. William Stein : So we shouldn't be modeling some step-up cost function in OpEx related to travel and such activities? I know there's some increase you've already guided to for I think bonuses and such, but for travel no? Vince Roche : Well, I think that's true. And when you look at the expenses today, our OpEx is laden with some very rich bonus payouts, because the business in terms of growth and profitability is doing very, very well. But we will -- over time, I expect that the growth will moderate and the bonuses will also moderate. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Will, maybe I can wrap up by saying we're expecting second half revenue to be strong. We indicated that second half gross margins are going to continue to increase, which is going to give you incredible leverage and therefore there is no reason you won't see a meaningful lift in op margins as each quarter rolls out. And all of that is going to translate into more cash flow, which we'll have available to deploy since we're not doing any further debt reduction, that's coming back to shareholders. William Stein : Great. Thanks so much. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Will, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our Web site. Our reconciliations will also be there. You can also find our new CSR report that Vince outlined in his script on our Analog Investor Relations homepage. And with that, thanks for joining us and your continued support of ADI. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vince Roche. Vince? Vince Roche : Thank you, Mike. And a very good morning to everybody. So, ADI delivered a second consecutive Quarter of record revenue and earnings, despite the challenging supply environments. Our strong performance was driven by continued operational excellence and insatiable demand as semiconductors power the modern digital age. Broadly speaking, the economic recovery continues to take shape with demand still far exceeding supply. We, like many others in our industry, will face a constrained supply environment into 2022. Despite this backdrop, our business continues to achieve record results as our investments and design win over the last few years are matched with strong demand across our end markets. So looking ahead, the combination of robust bookings, lean inventories, and ongoing capacity additions position ADI to close Fiscal '21 on a high note and continue to grow in the next year. So moving to our third-quarter results, revenue was $1.76 billion up 21% year-over-year. All markets increased sequentially with industrial and automotive once again, achieving the record. The gross margin expanded to over 71% and the Operating margin over 43%. Adjusted EPS of $1.72 increased 27% year-over-year. Despite elevated capital spending to increase our capacity, free cash flow over the trailing 12 months was $2.2 billion. This equates to a 34% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and our team's outstanding execution. As you know, at ADI, our ethos of innovation and deep customer engagements ensure that we stay ahead of what's possible. We invest more than a billion dollars annually in R&D focused on strengthening our core franchises and capturing market opportunities presented by sector growth records, which have accelerated the economic recovery. Now, let me share some recent highlights with you. Our industrial business is our most diverse segment across customers, products, and applications and features sticky long product lifecycles. Our largest industrial segment, instrumentation, and test, is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement, and scientific instruments. This is truly a performance-driven market that aligns perfectly with our high-performance precision Signal Chain, Power management, and RF portfolios. Importantly, instrumentation and text are aligned with all secular growth trends from connectivity to EVs to sustainability. The growing technical complexity of these applications required more testers with more advanced performance capabilities. Today, ADI is the leader in communications tests. And we're collaborating with Keysight, for example, to advance the development of O-RAN solutions. This partnership will enable the fastest path for the design and cost-effective and power-efficient radio units. Looking ahead, we're already beginning to partner with our customers to test emerging 6G technologies. Our innovations in the instrumentation market also have a positive impact on human and planetary health. One particular area is our environmental monitoring business, where there's an increased need for highly reliable and accurate instruments to improve the standard of living globally. Our market-leading portfolio of precision converters enables 10 times greater measurement resolution of fine particulate matter, better identifying trace pollution. The next largest industrial segment is factory automation. Over the last year, many of our customers are rethinking their factory flows and supply chains to make them more resilient, cost-effective, and flexible through automation and connectivity. To achieve this, our customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factories, and increase their use of robots and cobots. Specifically, cobots require ADI's precision signal chain and power franchises sensing technologies, and robust wired and wireless connectivity. This new vector of growth increases our sum opportunity by three times that of a traditional robot. To that end, our precision motion control business is on track for a record year of design wins, including a recent win at a leading Japanese robotics Company for its next-generation robots. In addition, we are leveraging our domain knowledge and system-level expertise in a collaboration with Universal Robots to design smaller, smarter, and easier-to-use robots that help scale tasks safely and transform workforces. We're turning now to our Communications business. 5G is beginning to broaden globally, especially in North America, as carriers look to deploy newly acquired C-band spectrum and all-round continues to gain momentum also, with several of the largest European carriers setting ambitious 2025 all-round deployment targets. This includes Vodafone where our technologies are very well represented. This quarter we extended our market-leading position in 5G radio solutions with the introduction of the industry's first software-defined transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. Our innovative radio architecture greatly improves power efficiency, thereby reducing radio weight, size, and carrier expenses. This high level of integration eliminates FPGAs to simplify implementation and facilitate the proliferation of these emerging O-RAN networks. Our next-generation receiver platform is already designed at a major Tier-1 global supplier that is gaining share in this 5 G and O-RAN deployments across North America as well as Europe. Stepping back, we expect our communications business to return to growth in 2022. We have strong design momentum and our geographic mix has shifted with North America, Europe, and Korea representing our largest sources of revenue. Moving now on to automotive. Over the last 2 years, we've realigned our business to focus on electrification and the in-cabin human experience. We're seeing the benefits of this strategy as we continue to scale our market leadership in battery management, power management, audio systems, and connectivity.  Starting firstly with our battery management systems or BMS, our wired and wireless portfolios provide unmatched accuracy to deliver market-leading vehicle range and can measure all key battery chemistries, including zero-Cobalt LFP. Additionally, our solutions incorporate ASLD functional safety and an ultra-low power continuous monitoring feature that ensures the battery remains stable even while parked, which is a first in the market. In addition, this quarter marked the first time we recognized revenue for our wireless BMS solution as General Motors prepares to ship its first of 30 EV models powered by the OTM battery platform. And this is just the beginning of this groundbreaking BMS technology as OEMs realized the power of wireless data in scaling their fleets. Turning to audio systems and connectivity. As complexity continues to increase, there's a very strong demand for our market-leading audio systems with signal processing. A2B connectivity, and active road noise cancellation. Our solutions offer the highest fidelity performance in the market while reducing vehicle weight, removing nearly 100 pounds per vehicle. During quarter 2 leading OEMs adopted A2B and a Top 3 European vehicle manufacturer implemented A2B as its audio connectivity standard across its entire fleet. In total, A2B is now designed in over 30 OEMs, including 18 of the top 20 global automotive Companies. Furthermore, interest in our active road noise cancellation feature continues to intensify. We're designed in at 9 OEMs, up from 5 just a year ago, including Hyundai and a leading EV manufacturer. The gadget capability can more than doubled the value of our A2B solution. These are just a few of the countless examples of the tremendous work underway at ADI.  We remain focused on delivering breakthrough innovations to stay ahead of our customer's needs. So in closing, I have never been more confident about ADI's future. Over the last decade, we've built an industry-leading portfolio with unparalleled breadth and depth of capabilities that are aligned with more profitable end markets. And our portfolio and leadership position will only get stronger with the acquisition of Maxim, enabling us to deliver strong returns in the years to come. And so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning and welcome to our third-quarter earnings call. My comment today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. ADI delivered exceptional third-quarter results, underpinned by our ability to increase production. Revenue and EPS reached all-time highs for the second straight quarter, with continued gross and Operating margin expansion. If we look at performance by end-market, industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased 3% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. Notably, this business surpassed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. We experienced broad-based strength across applications and geographies. All subsegments increased double-digits year-over-year, except healthcare, given the elevated pandemic demand a year ago. Communications represented 16% of revenue and decreased 21% year-over-year, while up 4% sequentially with growth in both wireless and wirelines. As we outlined last quarter, we believe our communications revenue has bottomed and we'll continue to grow as 5G deployments broaden globally, especially in North America. Automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 13% sequentially, and 80% year-over-year. Strength was broad-based with double-digit growth across every major application. BMS and A2B remain our fastest-growing applications and both are on track to nearly double in size this year. As Vince shared earlier, ADI has been strategically pivoting resources to focus more aggressively on electrification and the in-cabin human experience. As part of this strategy, we are licensing select radar IP to a large European Tier-1 auto supplier. This resulted in immediate revenue recognition of 24 million in the quarter. Consumer represented 10% of revenue and increased 16% both sequentially and year-over-year. Our strategy to diversify and grow this business in Fiscal '21 is working, as strength across home entertainment wearables, and wearables more than offset a decline in portables. And now moving to the P&L, gross margin expanded sequentially and year-over-year, finishing at 71.6% mainly due to the cost savings from the LPC manufacturing optimization and the IP license agreement. OpEx in the quarter was 493 million up modestly sequentially, due to a full quarter of mere increases and continued strong variable comp. This netted an Op margin of 43.6%, which marks the 5th straight quarter of year-over-year Op margin expansion, underscoring the strong leverage in our business. Non-op expenses were 37 million below our typical quarterly run rate of approximately 43 due to an investment gain. And our tax rate was approximately 12%, which gives us an adjusted EPS at $1.72, including $0.05 of upside attributable to the IP licensing agreement. Moving onto the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with an ending cash balance of 1.5 billion and a net leverage ratio of 1.2 times. Relative to the second quarter, inventory dollars increased by 16 million, driven entirely by raw materials and the working process. Days of inventory were unchanged at 118 and weeks of channel inventory remain well below the low-end of our seven to eight-week target, as sell-through remains stronger than sell-in. Capex for the quarter was $86 million up meaningfully sequentially, as we continue to add capacity to support our robust and growing order book, which now stretches into Fiscal '22. We will continue to increase capacity in the fourth quarter resulting in full-year capital intensity above our long-term model of 4%. In turning to free cash flow, we generated more than $2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, up 23% from a year ago. And this represented a 34% free cash flow margin. Over this same period, we have returned nearly 85% of free cash flow after debt repayments via $970 million in dividends and over $500 million in share repurchases. And now onto the Fourth Quarter outlook : Revenue is expected to be $1.78 billion, plus or minus $70 million, up sequentially as additional capacity comes online. At the midpoint, excluding the automotive IP licensing revenue, we expect each of our B2B markets to increase sequentially, led by communications and consumers to be up to 5 single digits. Based on the midpoint of the guide, we expect to deliver a record gross margin. And for operating margins to be 43.7% plus or minus 100 bps. Our tax rate is expected to fall toward the upper end of our range. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.72 plus or minus $0.11. So before moving to the Q&A, I'd like to give a brief update on Maxim. Our discussions with the Chinese Regulatory Authorities have been productive, and we're working towards closing within the initial timeframe. We plan on closing no later than the 3rd business day after China approval has been granted. As we shared before, shortly after the close, we will hold a conference call to provide an update on our capital return plans. Once combined, we anticipate having nearly 4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a leverage ratio well below one, and more than 3 billion of annual free cash flow. I'll now turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Let's get to our Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question, please re-queue and we will take your questions if time allows. With that, to our first question, please. Operator : If you are listening on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking your question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Once you mentioned demand far exceeds supply, I was hoping if you could help us quantify that. Are you under-shipping by 5%, 10%? How much of a demand cushion does ADI have right now?  And kind of Part B of that is how much incremental capacity are you planning to bring online in the next year and is that kind of a proxy for what kind of sales growth we should be looking at? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Vivek. So demand continues to grow across our markets. All end markets are up and our book-to-bill was above 1.2. Supply is also expanding. We grew 4% sequentially in the third quarter, and we're at the midpoint, we're going to be up another 3% for the fourth quarter. So you look at that math and it says the supply-demand gap is growing or said another way, the backlog is increasing quarter-over-quarter and it now extends well into 2022. Our view is this gap is likely to persist into calendar year '22 given the long lead time it takes to add supply in the industry plus just the broad strength of the demand. Vince Roche : Yeah, I think the second part of that question, Vivek, just a little bit of color. So, we're leering an investment in CapEx to support our growth objectives, particularly on the backend of our operation, assembly, and test. And we need this capital now to meet the demand, but also in the longer term, we're very, very optimistic about the tailwinds right across our business, from automation to electrification, connectivity, and so on and so forth. The outlook we've just given you supplies feasible and it is certainly the governor, I would say, right now on revenue for the Company. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Vivek. We go to the next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit more on the Maxim merger. You said that you'd still expect it to happen within the timeframe you had announced. I believe you had said the summer of 2021, correct me if that was wrong. And related to that is, again, China the only remaining obstacle before you can close the deal? Vince Roche : Thanks, Tore. So look our confidence in the closing remains unchanged. And as we said in the prepared comments, our discussions with the Chinese Regulatory Authorities have been positive and productive. And we are working towards closing within the initial timeframe. So China is the only outstanding regulatory approval need at this point in time. And I will remind you as well that all of the other regulatory bodies across the globe have approved our deal without condition, without remedies. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you for that, Vince. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Tore. Go to the next questions. Operator : Your next question is from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question, Vince, I wanted to pick up on your prepared comments about your industrial business. You're now going in the third consecutive quarter of sort of record revenue s in that business. You have to go back to April of '18 before -- which was the last peak. But -- but the other date -- but fiscal year to date, that business is up about 30% year-over-year, and for a lot of investors, they're concerned that perhaps that represents more cyclical excess than structural sustainability. And so I'm kind of curious as you break apart your industrial business. What do you think is being driven by the \" cycle versus stuff that's a little bit more sustainable? \" Vince Roche : Yes. Thanks, John (ph). First and foremost, I'd like to remind everybody that ADI's industrial business is built on a foundation of many individual market segments like automation, instrumentation that I talked about, healthcare, our space business, and energy, as it moves to renewables and charging infrastructure, for example, the whole need for grid efficiency and stabilization. So that's the foundation. It's a highly diverse business. We've got many tens of thousands of customers. And, you know, the lifecycles in the business are 15 years plus. And it's a very, very, very sticky socket that we've got. So, those of you who followed ADI for a long time, remember about a decade ago, we fairly dramatically increased our focus in terms of R&D, go-to-market activities, in ensuring that we could really grow that business. And the last years have shown that we've been getting market share across the board there. So I think there were a lot of programs that were stalled last year, so there's a certain amount of catch-up there. But I do think that the breadth of the portfolio that we know has the investments we've been making in terms of customer engagement, R&D activities, and the secular trends that we've got all these concurrent secular drivers are propelling that business beyond the market. Mike Lucarelli : I'll add one thing, John. You're right. As you've seen in our prepared comments, all the markets did increase double-digits year-over-year. Of our 6 applications that Vince outlined, 2 are still below pre-peak levels. We do think Fiscal '21 marks a record for all of them and we don't see why they won't hit another record in '22 given the strong trends that Vince outlined. And with that, we'll go to our next question. Operator : Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question about the pricing environment. Given just the tight supply and the shortage situation, we're starting to see some hints of some of your peers starting to take prices up. And I was curious what you guys are seeing in the pricing environment. Are you seeing that? Are you able to actually do that? Are you trading your own pricing environment down more conservatively? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks for the question, Stacy. So I would say that for the results that we printed, pricing is net-neutral. We're passing on cost increase so that we're not impacting margins, but we've made a decision not to take advantage of our customers by structurally increasing pricing in this environment. Our long-term model is unchanged and that is 70% plus. So the goal really is to drive the revenue growth and make the trade-offs that are necessary to drive that revenue growth. Focusing on delivering on the top margin and the free cash flow. So you'll see, if you back out the IP license impact, we had a 71.2% gross margin in the third quarter. And while we don't guide to gross margins, if you impute it from the guide that we gave you, the fourth quarter is going to probably be a record for ADI in terms of gross margins. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Thank Stacy. Next question. Operator : Your next question is from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the comms business. Vince, you talked about 2022 being a growth year, and you talked about North America, Europe, and Korea being the key drivers for you guys going forward. How should we think about the shape of the recovery going forward? Is it going to be a fairly gradual recovery? Could it be sort of a V-shaped recovery over the next couple of quarters? And when you talk about the return to growth in '22, what's sort of implicit assumption are you making for China? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Okay. Thanks. We're going to split that into 2. Let me just quickly talk about what happened and then I'll let Vince speak too more broadly. In the second quarter, as a reminder, we did call the bottom on comms and said that we would grow on a sequential basis. We delivered that in the third quarter and we are on track to deliver that for the fourth quarter. So we believe we're really well-positioned for strong growth into Fiscal '22. And between the two sub-segments there, wire demand remains strong and we expect that to continue as both carriers and data centers continue to do the upgrades to their networks. And wireless, it's always lumpy, growth in the past quarter was really driven by the rest of the world. North America. We do think China bottomed in the third quarter. So that should also represent some growth momentum for us as we go forward. And then I'll hand off to Vince to kind of speak more broadly about what we're seeing. Vince Roche : Yes, Toshiya, why do I have the confidence I have about 2022 being a strong growth year? So maybe I can unpack that a bit for you. So I think our comms' revenue mix is seeing a benefit from the rest of the world beginning to emerge in 5G. So today, the rest of the world outside of China is 3x in terms of the term. So that's number 1. If you look at then the geographies of North America, the auction to C-band auction's complete. Revenue's really just beginning here. And all the indications are that 5G revenue here will accelerate in 2022 and indeed beyond. Europe, it's -- I would say, a step behind, but we're beginning to see good signs of life in that region but I think it'll be a more elite 2022 driver. We've talked several times in various calls here about O-RAN, what's happening, but we're beginning to see revenue. We've talked before about Rakuten in Japan, that business continues to accelerate. And European carriers are looking right in to make it also an important part of their 5G offering. I mentioned during the prepared remarks as well that Vodafone is a major player there and we happen to be very well represented in their systems. And I'm also having conversations with customers about the use of 5G and O-RAN beyond the classical consumer market. So it's early days, but the characteristics of flexibility, scalability, quicker time-to-market, cost savings, and so on, are enabling private Networks to be configured in factory environments, for example. So that's all still on the comm, but that gives you a sense of our confidence in 2022 and beyond. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Toshiya. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. We'll go to the next question. Operator : Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hey, thank you. Good morning, folks. I have a question about Maxim. And so my investment case for ADI has not been Maxim and you have a very sticky shareholder base who have been with you before Maxim, but I get this question a lot, so I think it's a fair question to ask. If Maxim was not to go through, what do you think about capital allocation? Do you then go back to the playbook and say you would be changing how you think about capital allocation or you would continue on the M&A path and look at other opportunities? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So, in response to this, let me just remind everyone what the capital allocation policy is today because I think that we have a very shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. This is, that first call is really to invest in the business and that, although not a traditional definition, we do consider that organically kind of how we spend our R&D, and that is heavily pointed towards the B2B markets. And then we think about inorganic really more as it helps the technology portfolio or finds other ways to help us become more important to customers. But our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to customers. So, we are at 1.2 level leverage today. We do not need to reduce debt. So on a -- in an environment, despite the confidence that we have in the Maxim deal closing in an environment where that was not to have happened, would not look for us to really be changing that view of having all our incremental free cash flow go return to shareholders either through buybacks or through dividend. And as a reminder, I think over the past 3 years, we've averaged about a 10% increase in our dividend. So a very healthy commitment for our fixed income-focused investors as well as the repo. I think we're on track this year for an all-time high in terms of our repo activity. Back to the M&A, I'm going to hand that one to Vince to talk more about the alternatives there. Vince Roche : Yes. So as you know, you've seen over the years, we've always acquired very, very high-quality assets, and that will remain to be our view on things in the years ahead as well. Ambrish Srivastava : Okay. Thank you. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks. Ambrish. Next caller. Operator : Your next question is from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you looked at the B2B guidance, it's fairly flat, as I think industrial probably is flat given the slug segment guidance you gave. I'm just kind of curious as you look at this. Obviously, you had strong comments on the bookings. Is that gap really supply or are you starting to see demand tends to start to settle out at this level? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: That is purely clearly supplied. I think I mentioned in maybe the first or second question that book-to-bill for the quarter was over 1.2 and that's across all markets. So we are seeing very strong interest in products across all markets. Mike indicated in one of the other Q&A that they were likely to have the industrial markets hit an all-time high collectively for a calendar for Fiscal year '21 and expect that to continue to be on track to another record in FY '22. So very much a supply-constrained environment. Blayne Curtis : Thanks and I just want to follow up on the gross margin, Prashanth. So you indicated the gross margin would be up and I think that's with the license impact as well. So you saw a benefit from the linear. I was curious how much more there is of that as a benefit. And then maybe just talk about utilizations and another pulling gross margin as you look over the next couple of quarters. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. So I presume you're asking with respect to the guidance. So in the fourth quarter, and we're not guiding gross margins, but we're pretty confident we are going to hit a new record for gross margins that are coming from the LTC synergies, I think we hit the final phase of closing down the manufacturing operation in California. We still have an opportunity as soon as the supply environment allows us to get some additional savings out of Asia because we haven't closed that facility up because we have no time to shift the tools to their new location. Utilization is also going to provide some level of increase. I would say the mix is a bit of a headwind into the Fourth Quarter. And Fourth Quarters typically have some level of challenges in terms of a holiday shutdown. So, we need to manage through that, which can provide a little bit of headwind for us as well that we got to work ourselves around. Vince Roche : You know, the foundation for our gross margins being where they are, It's the number 1 innovation. We produced the best performing solutions between the physical and digital worlds and we got a premium. We got very, very well paid for doing that. Also, the diversity of our products and customer portfolios, 125,000 customers with I think I've said this before, 85% of our sales come from products that individually contributed less than 0.1%. And the pricing environment, as we said earlier on the call, has been very, very stable, very steady. Mike Lucarelli : Thanks, Blayne, for that two-part, one-part question. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Your next question is from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good morning and congratulations on the strong results in quarterly execution. Channel inventories continue to remain below your target 7 to the 8-week range. You guys can also monitor direct customer inventories at least for those that are on consignment programs. Any signs that customers have been able to build inventories? I mean, it seems unlikely because the entire value chain appears to be sort of hand-to-mouth from a chip supply perspective, but I wanted to get your views. And when do you believe customers will be in a position to start to build that inventory? I'm assuming the soonest is sometime in calendar '22, but I wanted to get your views as well. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thank you, Harlan Sur. I'll take that. So first, a couple of comments on inventory. Inventory on our balance sheet is up year-over-year and sequentially, but that is exclusively due to raw materials and width. We can't keep a finished good in stock. So when it's produced, it either goes to the customer or it goes into the channel, and then it goes out of the channel immediately. So we are struggling to build finished goods inventory both in ADI warehouses as well as in our channel partners. Roughly, let's say a significant amount of our auto business is on consignment which gives us good visibility for that direct business as to what's happening there. And that is also we are seeing that demand pull through pretty quickly and no opportunity for those auto customers to build the inventory within their warehouses, but that's on our books. So it's still very much hand-to-mouth and the focus that we have as we've talked throughout this call and in the prepared remarks is on increasing our capacity or ability to supply by making some significant investments in capacity. I don't see this balance coming into some sense of normalcy until sometime in calendar year '22. Harlan Sur : Okay, thank you. Mike Lucarelli : All right. We'll have our last question, please. Operator : Your next question is from William Stein of Trust Securities William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my question. You just talked about inventory not coming to some level of ability to rebuild anything until sometime in '22, you talked about the supply debate about lasting. We're well into '22, which put you up to the bill, etc. When we look out to the next quarter, the January quarter, typically, that's a sequentially down quarter in automotive, industrial, consumer, and for the whole business as well. But given these supply constraints of this very significant backlog, should we think about that seasonality as different in the coming year? Should we expect maybe some visibility to sequential growth for the next several quarters? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah, I think the way to answer that would be to say that seasonality in today's environment is a bit of a meaningless concept because revenue growth is really dictated completely by supply. So the print for Q1 is likely to be driven by what more capacity we can get online over the fourth quarter to allow us. Again now we've got a couple of things we need to work through in the first quarter that would be a little bit of an offset. And first, there's the holiday season. So we do need to adjust factory capacity for that. And fourth quarter is the key quarter for the consumer; that's when they build for the holiday season. So there's always going to be a little bit of seasonality impact for the consumer just because they don't need it in our fiscal first quarter as that is the holiday period. So maybe that's where I will finish. Mike, anything you want to add to that? Mike Lucarelli : Yeah, sure. I guess if you look back, you're right. We talk about seasonality not being as meaningful now, but just give you a bit of a history lesson. If you look past over the past 10 years, you're right, our B2B markets, I would say in good times, which I would call now good times, it's usually flatted down slightly in 1Q and consumer, I will say in good and even normal times it down 5% or maybe more in 1Q. And with that, I want to thank everyone for joining the call this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. And all reconciliations and additional information can also be found in the Quarterly Results section. Thanks again for joining and your continued interest in ADI.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. Please note we published a table on our Investor web page of historical pro forma combined end market revenue aligned to ADI fiscal quarters. As part of this exercise, we also mapped subsegments to match ADI's groupings. As a result of this reclassification, about $150 million of annual revenue moved from industrial and communications to consumer for the Maxim business. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. Well, once again, we delivered record revenue and profits in our fourth quarter, closing out what was a milestone year for ADI. Our success was driven by our industry leading high performance portfolio and our team's strong operational execution, enabling us to better meet the insatiable demand for our products. Now stepping back a little. 2021 truly demonstrated the vital importance of semiconductors to the modern digital age. We invested ahead of this inflection, building a comprehensive portfolio to better solve our customers' most complex problems in this ubiquitously sensed and connected world. As we enter 2022, our backlog and bookings remain robust and we continue to invest in manufacturing capacity, positioning us well for another successful year ahead. Now moving on to our results. Our fourth quarter revenue was $2.34 billion and EPS was $1.73, both exceeding the midpoint of guidance. And for 2021, our revenue was $7.32 billion and EPS was $6.46. Looking at our organic ADI. We delivered new high watermarks on revenue and profits. Industrial and automotive achieved record revenue this year, while consumer returns to annual growth for the first time since 2017. And communications revenue declined its continued strength and wired was offset by weakness in wireless related to the China market. In 2021, we generated a record $2.4 billion of free cash flow, equating to a free cash flow margin of approximately 33%. This maintains our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. In line with our revised capital allocation strategy to return 100% of free cash flow, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share buybacks. It was not only a record year for performance and shareholder returns but also for investments that position us to better capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers in our business. First, we took decisive action to add capacity throughout the year with more than $340 million in capital expenditures. This is enabling us to better navigate the near-term supply/demand imbalance while achieving our long-term growth objectives. And in 2022, we're planning to expand our internal manufacturing capacity at our factories in the US and Europe. These additional investments will create more profitable, flexible and resilient manufacturing capabilities at ADI. Now at our core, we're an innovation driven enterprise. And together with Maxim, we will invest more than $1.6 billion in R&D annually to ensure we continue developing solutions that define the edge of possible. As you know, to complement our organic efforts, we selectively use M&A to expand both our scale and our scope. In 2017, the acquisition of LTC reflected this strategy. Since acquiring the franchise, we delivered on our goal to double its historical growth rate. Equally impressive was our ability to improve on Linear's industry leading gross margins. More recently, we completed the acquisition of Maxim Integrated. Similar to previous acquisitions, we're combining the best from ADI and Maxim to develop a new operating system that enhances customer engagement and drives long term profitable growth. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made already. On the customer engagement side, the integration of our field teams has brought a tremendous degree of excitement. The team is already beginning to identify cross selling opportunities and building out our opportunity pipeline. From an engineering and operations perspective, our teams are coming together at a remarkable speed and we're aligning product and technology road maps to help accelerate growth in the years ahead. This combination also strengthens the diversity of our portfolio and enriches our resilient business model. To that end, we now have approximately 75,000 product SKUs and 80% of these products individually account for less than 0.1% of our total revenue. And the addition of Maxim provides us with a more comprehensive power portfolio, Maxim's primarily application focused power offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. This adds new SAM in all our markets and enhances cross selling opportunities, accelerating revenue growth in our $2 billion-plus power portfolio. Given these investments, we entered 2022 with an unparalleled portfolio of technology and talent aimed at capitalizing on the secular growth trends across all our markets. And now I'd like to share a few examples of how our business is at the heart of these emerging trends, starting with industrial. 2021 was a better year for our highly diversified and profitable industrial business with all applications achieving all time highs. Our unrivaled high performance portfolio continues to benefit from the mass digitalization movement across industries. Our largest industrial segment, instrumentation and test, is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments. These applications must combat increasing test times as system complexity and metrology requirements rise exponentially. For example, processors in memory and data centers are leveraging finer node geometries with higher levels of integration, which can double the test time. This challenge is our opportunity. Our innovative, purpose built solutions are bringing test time back to parity while increasing our content by more than 50%. Factory automation is one of our largest industrial segments. I believe we're at a tipping point in the Industry 4.0 as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing and connectivity to make their supply chains more robust, efficient and, of course, flexible. ADI's precision signal chain and power franchises, sensing technologies and robust wired and wireless connectivity are critical to enabling these efforts. Looking ahead, we have an enormous opportunity to connect Maxim's rich power portfolio, which is underrepresented in the industrial sector today with ADI's strong position. Shifting now to automotive. In a year dominated by chip shortage headlines, we achieved record revenue as consumers and manufacturers are embracing electric vehicles and an enhanced in-vehicle experience. These two areas need additional semiconductor content and align very well with the strengths of both ADI and Maxim. In electric vehicles, our market leading wired and wireless battery management systems, or BMS, offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability and safety as well as flexibility to scale across all battery chemistries, including the more environmentally friendly zero cobalt LFP. Our BMS position is further strengthened with Maxim. We now sell to seven of the top 10 EV manufacturers and our increased technology and product scale enables us to address new SAM. Our efficiency is also critical in electric vehicles to better optimize performance and range. Here, Maxim's strong and growing power management capabilities complement our portfolio. Now inside the vehicle, automakers are enhancing the in-cabin experience. ADI's market leading audio systems with signal processing, A2B connectivity and active road noise cancellation continues to gain traction. In 2021, our A2B franchise was designed in at five major OEMs. And since its launch in 2016, we've shipped over 50 million A2B nodes, and we expect this to double within the next three years. With Maxim, our in-cabin connectivity offerings expand to include their industry leading GMSL franchise, which is critical in architecting advanced driver assistance systems. Turning to communications. 2021 was an uneven year as strength in wired was offset by weakness in the China wireless market. Encouragingly, as we look to 2022, the proliferation of 5G is gaining momentum globally, especially in North America. In the wireless market, ADI is the leader with more than double the market share of our closest competitor. This year, we introduced the industry's first software defined radio transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. This next generation transceiver platform enables us to defend and extend our position in traditional 5G and emerging O-RAN networks. Additionally, Maxim's power portfolio will support our goal to increase our power attach rate in the wireless market. In our wired business, we grew again this year as data centers and networking became increasingly vital to accelerating digitalization. Maxim more than doubles our exposure to data centers and adds new growth vectors with its power management solutions for cloud processors and accelerators, and momentum is building with a strong pipeline across traditional customers as well as hyperscalers. Finally, moving on to consumer. Our business delivered double digit growth this year as we executed on our strategy to diversify our customers' products and applications. Maxim further builds in these efforts, bringing additional power, audio and sensing capabilities and adding new applications like fast charging and gaming. Given the strong pipeline and design wins for our signal processing solutions across hearables, wearables and professional audio video, combined with our power management capabilities, I'm confident that we're on the path for continued growth. Now I'd like to focus on ESG just a little, which is now an integral part of our business strategy. Broadly speaking, I believe semiconductors can play a major role in improving our standard of living while also protecting our planetary health. For example, ADI's technology is critical to optimizing global energy efficiency from EVs and charging stations to sustainable energy and smart grids. We're not only investing in these applications, but they represent a meaningful and growing portion of ADI's revenue today. So we've made substantial progress on our ESG initiatives in 2021, including a commitment to increase the use of sustainable energy for 100% of our organic ADI manufacturing activities by 2025, up from 50% today. Actions like these will help us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. We launched the Ocean and Climate Innovation Accelerator Consortium focused on the critical role of oceans in combating climate change. And we've enhanced our disclosure and transparency in ESG topics, especially around diversity, equity and inclusion. In the year ahead, we look to extend our ESG initiatives across the combined company and, of course, make further progress toward our goals. So in closing, I'd like to thank our employees and partners who worked tirelessly throughout this past year, helping ADI achieve these historic results. We're off to a strong start in 2022 with continued robust demand and line of sight to capacity additions. And I've never been more optimistic about ADI's future. Our industry leading position is stronger with Maxim as we expand our capabilities to capitalize on emerging secular drivers positioning us for faster growth in the years ahead. And with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our year end earnings call. Except for revenue, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Also, the acquisition of Maxim closed on August 26th. As such, I will discuss results inclusive of Maxim's contributions for approximately 9.5 weeks. I'll begin with a brief review of 2021. We delivered sequential revenue growth every quarter, leading to a new all time high of $7.32 billion. Gross margins of 70.9% increased 180 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and the savings from a legacy LTC plant optimization. Operating margins of 42.4% increased 250 basis points, reflecting gross margin fall through and disciplined discretionary spending. All told, adjusted EPS increased more than 30% to a record $6.46. Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $2.34 billion exceeded the midpoint of our updated guidance. Maxim's contribution to revenue was $559 million. Looking at the end market results and to give a better view into the underlying trends, I'll focus my remarks on organic ADI results. But this will be the last earnings call where we provide ADI organic commentary. Industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased slightly sequentially and 25% year-over-year with growth across every subsegment. For the full year, industrial increased 28%. This strong performance once again, is a testament to our sustained relative outperformance in the industrial market. Communications represented 16% of revenue and was flat sequentially while decreasing year-over-year. For the year, we delivered record wired sales while total comps declined due to the weakness in China wireless, largely related to geopolitical tensions. Excluding this region, total comps grew more than 20% in 2021. And overall, our [comms] geographic mix shifted with North America, Europe and Korea, now representing our largest sources of revenue. Automotive represented 15% of revenue and was down 9% sequentially as the third quarter included revenue from an IP licensing agreement. Excluding this, auto was flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, auto increased 15% with BMS more than doubling, reflecting our leadership position in the electrification ecosystem. For the year, auto exhibited robust broad-based growth, finishing up 36%. Consumer represented 12% of revenue and increased more than 20% sequentially and year-over-year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of annual growth. Over a year ago, we said consumer would grow in 2021 and the team delivered on this commitment with consumer increasing 12% for the year. Moving on to the rest of the fourth quarter P&L. I'm going to speak to the results inclusive of the partial quarter of Maxim. Gross margins were 70.9%, up 90 bps year-over-year. Operating margins finished at 43.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. Non-op expense was $44 million and the tax rate was 12.7%. All in, adjusted EPS was $1.73 above the midpoint of guide and up more than 20% year-over-year. If we look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and equivalents and on a trailing 12 month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 turns. Building on our ESG efforts, we continue to strategically leverage sustainable financing. We're proud to be the first US tech company to deploy three sustainable finance instruments with our inaugural green bond issuance, a sustainability linked revolving credit facility and a sustainability linked to bond offering. Specifically, this bond offering was part of our $4 billion refinancing efforts during the quarter. And as a result, we lowered our weighted average coupon to 2.7% while extending the average duration of our total debt by nearly 10 years. Inventory dollars increased slightly sequentially after adjusting for the partial quarter of Maxim activity and the fair value step-up of inventory related to the acquisition, while inventory days were down slightly. Channel inventory declined and remains below the low end of our seven to eight week target. Moving to the cash flow statement. For the year, cash flow from operations increased 36% to more than $2.7 billion. We generated a record free cash flow of $2.4 billion or approximately 33% of revenue despite CapEx more than doubling to $344 million or 4.7% of revenue. We also returned a record $3.7 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow to shareholders this year by dividends and buybacks, including 80% of our $2.5 billion ASR program. As a reminder, we plan to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. This is accomplished by growing our dividend annually with 40% to 60% dividend payout target and by using residual cash flow or buybacks. We entered 2022 as a much larger enterprise with an attractive long term outlook. As Vince mentioned, we plan to increase our capacity investments to support revenue growth and reinforce the resiliency and efficiency of our hybrid manufacturing model. As such, we anticipate CapEx being 6% to 8% of revenue for 2022 above our long term model of 4%. This step-up in CapEx will not impact the commitment we made in September to buy back 5 billion of shares by the end of calendar '22. So now on to the first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.6 billion plus or minus $100 million. Based on the midpoint, we expect operating margin to be 43.3 plus or minus 70 bps. We expect non-op expenses of approximately $50 million, a 12.5% tax rate and a share count of approximately 530 million. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.78 plus or minus $0.10. For additional context, using the fourth quarter pro forma combined revenue as a base, our guide at the midpoint implies low single digit growth quarter-on-quarter in Q1 to what is normally a seasonally weaker quarter. This growth is driven by an increase in B2B quarter-over-quarter, while consumer is down sequentially. So before closing, I want to give a brief update on our Maxim integration progress. Phase 1 of shareholder value creation is well underway, building conviction in our cost synergy timeline. We anticipate realizing over 40% of the initial $275 million OpEx and COGS synergy target in fiscal '22 with the remaining coming in fiscal '23. I'm proud of the team's effort and confident this pace of execution will continue. At our Analyst Day next spring, we'll update investors on our progress as well as provide more details on Phases 2 and 3, which relate to additional savings from infrastructure optimization and revenue synergies, respectively. Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to congratulate Mike Lucarelli on his promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Look forward to working with you Mike in this continued partnership. Let me hand it over to you to take Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. All right. With that, let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, we have our first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Congratulations on the solid quarter. Vince, Prashanth, if I exclude kind of the Maxim revenue in the October quarter, the core ADI business just came in line with the midpoint of your original range, which is clearly not horrible. But just given strength of business and kind of your pension to tend to give upside and the view that maybe Maxim was more supply constrained than ADI. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand that dynamic and maybe it's getting rectified in the January quarter being guided above seasonal. But were there supply constraints in the quarter that impacted either revenue and/or margins? And any kind of conversation around that would be helpful. Vincent Roche : In the past quarter, our organic supply had some impact from some COVID shutdowns in Southeast Asia that affected much of the industry. We still did grow sequentially in the fourth quarter. But as we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, our supply has been limited and revenue really is a function of supply. So that hiccup did put a little bit of pressure on the revenue line, and you'll see that correct itself as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Mike, congrats on the promotion. I guess I had a question on pricing and also long term supply agreements. Quite a few of your competitors or peers in the industry have talked about approaching customers, or customers approaching them about long term agreements. I think you gave a couple of comments on past calls, but if you can update us on how you're thinking about initiatives of that sort, that would be super helpful and how you're balancing that with your long-term purchases of wafer capacity. Any comments on how to think about pricing broadly going forward would be super helpful. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Why don't I take pricing, and I'll let Vince kind of speak how we think about it longer term. So the short answer is, for 2021, we've been talking about rising cost inflations over the course of the year, and we've been raising our prices with the goal of neutralizing the impact to margin. I would say that in the fiscal year that just finished, cost increases and price increases were not completely synchronized. So it's very likely that cost inflation outpaced our pricing actions for the year and we're likely a modest headwind to the year. As we go into 2022, we're looking for the inverse of that. We're looking for pricing net of inflation to be a modest tailwind to the year as the price increases that have begun -- begin to get more traction. And we believe that while we still will have some cost increases over the course of the year, most of those are now baked into the run rate. Vincent Roche : Toshi, I can take a slightly longer-term view of things. I think it's true to say, certainly from our standpoint, that price increases aren't new. We've been systematically raising prices as a company for many, many years, I think we've talked about before. We continue to deliver increasing value in our new product streams. And we also maintain products for our customers that are often more than 20 years in -- 20 years old in vintage terms. We've taken a very measured approach to pricing over the last year. And we've been very transparent with our customers as well that price increases are really more about passing on costs rather than looking to enhancing our margins. Last comment on pricing. I think the industry, as we approach this kind of post-Moore's Law era, we're in an era now, I believe, of structural price increases rather than cyclical. In other words, I think you'll start to see inflation sustained for the industry in the years ahead. It's been proven over the last couple of years for certain that semis are the roots of the modern digital economy. And I think customers understand as well that importance and the value that is increasingly created by semi. So I believe that, as I said, inflation will persist. It will moderate, but I think it's a facet now of the business structure of the semi industry and indeed ADI's business. Operator : Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations on the record results. Vince, you're probably not going to share revenue synergy numbers with us probably until the Analyst Day. But could you perhaps just give us some examples of potential revenue synergies between Maxim and ADI, please? Vincent Roche : I mean, there are many, many. I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for example, that Maxim is very underrepresented in the industrial space where ADI is very, very strong. Half our business, total business is industrial, and it's a very, very small part of Maxim's business. And where I see the opportunity there is really on the power side of things, power management, in particular. It's the fastest growing segment in the analog space. And I think generally, across the board, we're still underrepresented as a company in power. We today have approximately $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion of combined power revenues. My sense is we can double that in a reasonable period of time. And we'll give a lot more detail on that when we get to the Investor Day over the next couple of months. And from an application and market standpoint, I'd just like to point to data center. You know the power management solutions that Maxim has for companionship with cloud processors, AI machines, accelerators and so on, I think will combine very nicely with ADI's data center micromodules. And then in automotive, connectivity, Maxim's GMSL high speed link technology used in our in-cabin connectivity portfolio, will enable us to optimize solutions and address a lot more applications in the car. And that's a nice companion as well to ADI's A2B connectivity solution for audio. And last but not least, Maxim has added a lot of heft to our BMS portfolio and our portfolio now is double the size it was pre-Maxim. And as I mentioned, again, in the prepared remarks, we now sell to seven out of the top 10 OEMs in the electric car area. And there's a lot more examples but they are the primary ones I'd like to point out at this stage. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Vince, I just wanted to get your perspective on the shape of kind of fiscal '22 sales growth. Your Q1 outlook implies, I believe, about 19% pro forma sales growth, that's well above your closest Analog peers with an acceleration from Q4. And if I were to assume that Q1 is kind of the low point of the year and you grow supply sequentially, that points to a double digit sales growth. So I know you're not giving full year guidance, but are we thinking about it the right way? And what could be the puts and takes from a supply and then also a mix perspective as we go through the year? Vincent Roche : So I'm going to at least give you some shape on that. So when we look into 2022, we can see growth across all the various market sectors for the year. And I think it's possible that we'll see another double digit top line year for ADI. And the primary reasons, well, we've got a very strong backlog as we enter the year. We're seeing broad based demand continue. I think also, we're seeing some improvement, generally speaking. With each passing month, we're seeing improvements in supply. So I think that line of sight gives us increased confidence, that's both internally as well as externally. We are in catch up more than pricing. So I think you'll see some significant contribution in 2022 from pricing activities. And also, inventories continue to remain low in the distribution channel and, of course, on the customer side pretty much on a broad basis. So I think overall, '22 should shape up to be a good year and we've got many, many drivers there on our side. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Vivek, maybe just double clicking on the supply item to provide clarity. We put in a fair amount of equipment orders for the legacy ADI operations. So we expect ADI capacity to continue to increase quarter-on-quarter over the coming fiscal year. On the Maxim side, we've done the same, but those orders only went in when the deal closed. So given the long lead times from the semi-cap guys, we're probably unlikely to see a meaningful increase in Maxim's ability to supply until the tail end of the year. So unfortunately, I think Maxim, from a fiscal year basis, will probably be a little bit of a drag on growth just because we can't get the tools fast enough. Operator : Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I just wanted to say thanks to Mike for providing all the web schedule that really goes a long way in transparency. So I really appreciate that. My question is on lead times and the expedites. I just wanted to see what you're seeing versus what TI highlighted, which was very different than what we've heard from other companies. So specifically, are you seeing expedites narrow down and then where are your lead times? So I think in the last earnings call, you had mentioned or in my call back, you had mentioned that you had 25% hotspots. So color on those would be helpful. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Ambrish, we're really not seeing much of a change. The customer -- on customer buying behavior, book-to-bill is well above one in the fourth quarter. So our outlook to grow quarter-on-quarter for the first quarter in what is normally a seasonally weaker quarter as a reference to that. Our backlog increased and we're starting 2022 with a very high level, and we have not seen much change in cancellations or pushouts. So we're continuing to do what we have been doing and that is we're reviewing with sales and ops for red flags that would indicate there's some level of turning in the market. We haven't seen anything notable, really it's pretty strong across all end markets and all geographies. And as we've said before, we manage our business on sell-through. So we really look through distribution to get insight from where our products are going on a sell-through basis to understand what's happening in terms of who's buying and where it's being shipped to. So we're prepared for things to change but I would say right now, it continues to feel as it did a quarter ago. Vincent Roche : I think briefly from my perspective. The number of conversations that I've been having with customers certainly hasn't slowed down. And in these conversations, it's pretty clear to me that what we're being requested to support as real demand. So our customers are trying to get products out the door, and they're not building inventories at this point in time. Ambrish Srivastava : And have the lead times changed versus where they were last quarter? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: It depends on the product, and it depends on the market. So we have some areas where they continue to extend and others that have stabilized. So overall, lead times are above normal and it's not where we want them to be. But it's very product and market specific given the diversity of what we make and where we make it. Vincent Roche : I think it's true to say lead times have stabilized. Operator : Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : I wanted to ask a little more about the shape of the synergies. I think you had said the cost synergies would be in 40% this year and the remainder of next year. Can you give us some idea how do those split out between OpEx and gross margin and COGS, and what is the proper sort of all-in baseline for OpEx that we should be building those synergies off of? And I guess, finally, with gross margins along with same lines, given you've got pricing and other stuff as a tailwind and you see revenue growth. Do you still think that Q1 gross margins wherever they want coming out, is that the trough for the year, given how everything else flows through? Vincent Roche : So Stacy, the way to think about the cost synergies is we said roughly 40% in the coming fiscal and then the balance in 2023. The majority of the coming fiscal will actually be in cost of goods. And then in 2023, you'll see that flip to be the majority of that coming in OpEx. What else can I tell you there -- anything else [Mike] that's relevant\u2026 Michael Lucarelli : I'll call that -- that would be -- that's Phase 1. We will talk more about Phase 2 at the Analyst Day and we'll look to increase that synergy target at that time. And I think you had second question on gross margin, I'll pass it back to Prashanth\u2026 Stacy Rasgon : Also what\u2019s the proper sort of like current like folding run rate for OpEx right now? Vincent Roche : If you look at our our first quarter guide, and that's probably a good level of run rate OpEx, I would say. In that guide, there is about $20 million of annual OpEx we took out in our fourth quarter. So maybe add $20 million to that for the run rate\u2026 Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: On gross margins, the -- so first quarter seasonally tends to be a little bit lower because we have the holiday shutdowns and this first quarter here will have a full quarter of Maxim, which as many of you know, had lower gross margins than stand-alone ADI. So we've got some headwind coming from that. The tailwind is we've got the revenue that's coming in strong and pricing, as I mentioned earlier, is going to be -- start to be mildly accretive. So all in, I would think gross margins kind of sequentially, I think, flattish is a safe model. Vincent Roche : And you're right, on the gross margin for the year, the plan is for it to continue to rise throughout the year, assuming demand remains strong and mix doesn't change given synergies and also our pricing actions. Operator : Your next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Congratulations on the strong results and execution. On inventories, I think you mentioned that they continue to be below your target range of seven to eight weeks. And I know that on a finished goods perspective, at least through Q3, that was down year-over-year, it was down year-to-date versus an increase in total inventories, which implies to me that consignment or direct customer inventories are also quite lean and demand is strong. And so I guess what's your view on when the team and your customers will be in a position to build back inventories or is it just hand them out for the next several quarters? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I think it probably looks to be continued hand to mouth for the next couple of quarters. Our inventory numbers are a little bit confusing because of some of the map that's in there. So I'll just go back to what I said in the prepared remarks. Days of inventory was down slightly. The internal inventory balance was up as we built raw materials and WIP. You have some noise in there from Maxim's inventory being added into our middle of the quarter as well as the purchase accounting math, which requires us to do a step up of that. So adjusting for all of that, we were up slightly in terms of ADI balance sheet inventory and most of that was in WIP. On the channel side, it remains very lean and well below where we want it to be, and that causes some challenges on customer service as it does for everyone in the industry. We don't see that abating at least for the first or second quarter, and it's hard for us to see further out than that. Operator : Your last question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: I guess a question on supply and gross margins. As you look at fiscal '22, can you speak to the growth you anticipate from internal versus external supply? And then based on that, how should we think about the implications to your gross margins? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So C.J., well, let's break down the dynamics. On the internal supply, I mentioned that ADI's internal capacity will continue to improve as we go through every quarter as we bring more equipment online. On the Maxim side, I mentioned that is pretty much flat for most of the year. We're optimistic that we might be able to see some improvement towards the tail end of the year as we get more equipment in. On the external side, I will say that Vince himself is personally involved in conversations with our foundry partners and looking to get additional wafer capacity when we can, but it's very much driven by what nodes are available. And maybe I'll pass to Vince here to add a bit more comment since you've been having a lot of those conversations\u2026 Vincent Roche : I think the best answer we can give you, C.J., is that we've indicated we expect gross margins to increase throughout the year. And we've got a hybrid model. So we expect to -- against that, we're not expecting any kind of external, internal prohibitions that will impact gross margin but we expect it to increase throughout the year. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. A content transcript will be available on our Web site and all available reconciliations and this information can also be found there. Thanks again for joining us and your continued [Technical Difficulty] Analog Devices. Have a great Thanksgiving. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release. Okay. With that, I will turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Well, thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. So once again, ADI delivered another record quarter, marking a strong start to the year. Our continued success was driven by our unparalleled high-performance portfolio and our team\u2019s strong operational execution and intense customer focus, enabling us to better meet the growing demand for our products. Now, looking at our first quarter results, revenue was $2.68 billion, up more than 20% year-over-year on a combined basis. Growth was broad-based, with all segments up double-digits year-over-year, led by industrial and automotive. Gross margin expanded to 72% and operating margin increased to over 45%. Adjusted EPS was $1.94, up 35% year-over-year. Now, it\u2019s been nearly 6 months since we closed the Maxim transaction, overall, we have made great progress on the integration to-date. The feedback we have received from customers and our teams has been overwhelmingly positive and we have taken important steps to strengthen our operations. In the many exchanges I have had with our customers, they have expressed their enthusiasm for the combination recognizing the increased value that ADI and Maxim together bring to the market. Broadly speaking, ADI is viewed as a trusted, long-term focused partner that takes a customer-first approach to our engagements. We offer a unique combination of best-in-class engineering and unmatched domain expertise, with a high-performance portfolio that spans from microwave to bits, from nanowatts to kilowatts and from sensor to cloud. This is enabling us to develop more complete solutions that define the edge of possible. The acquisition of Maxim increases the breadth and depth of our high-performance portfolio, especially in power management. Here, our more comprehensive power portfolio allows us to better address opportunities across industrial, automotive, datacenter, connectivity and consumers. Similar to the cross-selling activity we implemented with the LTC portfolio, we are aggressively identifying areas to attach this power portfolio with ADI\u2019s leadership positions in analog, mixed signal and RF. And with our extended sales and field organizations, we are better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support at a solutions level. I have also been highly engaged with our teams across ADI. The combination has unleashed excitement throughout the organization. There is a burning desire to capitalize on the numerous opportunities to accelerate revenue growth. And I am already seeing firsthand the benefits of our collaboration, from operations, to engineering, to sales, making me excited for what\u2019s ahead. Turning firstly to our manufacturing operations, the analog sector is characterized by fragmentation, with diversity across products, customers, applications and markets. To tackle this complexity, we utilize a hybrid manufacturing strategy, providing us with vast capabilities across technology, processes and packaging necessary to create innovative solutions from 7 nanometers to 7 microns for our 125,000 customers. The combination with Maxim enhances our hybrid manufacturing model by enabling a more diverse network of internal facilities and external partners. This increases our access to technologies and capabilities, which in turn expands the scale and the scope of our offerings. We are investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost effective model. To that end, we are expanding the footprints of our Oregon and Limerick fabs and adding significant capital to our test operations at our facilities in the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. These investments will grow our capacity this year and into 2023, provides seamless product qualifications for our customers, and give us greater optionality between our internal facilities and foundry partners. Now ahead of our Investor Day in April, I\u2019d like to preview some of the secular growth trends that make us most excited about the future of our industry and for our company. In the industrial market, we are seeing the compounding effect of many concurrent secular trends. For example, our instrumentation business, which is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments, is aligned with growth trends from connectivity, to EVs, to sustainability. The growing technology complexity of these applications requires ADI\u2019s more advanced metrology solutions, enabling us to continue increasing our SAM. Our factory automation business is empowering another critical trend of more intelligent and connected factories. Here, we support tens of thousands of customers of all sizes with our precision signal chain, power management, sensing technologies, and robust wired and wireless connectivity solutions. In automotive electrification, we are the global leader in battery management systems for EVs, with double the market share of our nearest competitor. We are continuing to build momentum globally. And in the last quarter, we have recorded several new design wins from premium European auto manufacturers. Electrification is not exclusive to the automotive sector. There is a necessary shift to sustainable energy sources to deliver the environmental benefits of electrification. This vision requires green energy generation with a smart grid, which digitally monitors and adjusts performance and also energy storage systems, which mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. ADI supports this infrastructure with control and sensing technologies as well as accurate monitoring and efficient power conversion to ensure the grid parameters remain stable. Within automotive, we are also seeing manufacturers create a more immersive human experience by digitalizing the cabin. This requires increased bandwidth, lower latency and more efficient power management, creating new opportunities for ADI\u2019s connectivity and power portfolios. For example, our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation provide customers with the highest fidelity solution while also reducing the vehicle\u2019s weight. In addition, our GMSL franchise and functional safety certified power management solutions are critical in architecting and efficiently powering advanced driver assistance systems. Overall, our market-leading positions in BMS, audio systems and GMSL, combined with our complementary customer bases, position our automotive franchise to deliver strong growth in the years ahead. Turning now to advanced communications networks, in wireless, ADI\u2019s market leading software-defined transceiver portfolio is enabling next-generation communication systems from traditional 5G, to O-RAN, to low earth orbit satellites. And we are expanding our SAM with the industry\u2019s first transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front-end. In wireline, our optical control and power portfolios are critical to tackling the exponential growth in bandwidth and compute power of carrier networks and hyperscale datacenters. Here we see a large and underserved opportunity for ADI. So with that backdrop, we look forward to expanding on these areas and more at our Investor Day with our senior leadership team. So in closing, ADI is the leader in innovating at the edge. We have an industry leading high-performance portfolio that continues to benefit from the acceleration of mass digitalization across industries. And with Maxim, our portfolio has increased in breadth and depth and we see even more opportunity than ever to capture additional market share. And I am very optimistic about what our future holds. And so with that, I will hand you over to Prashanth who will take us through the financial details. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today\u2019s press release. The revenue commentary is on a pro forma basis and includes pre-acquisition Maxim revenue in the comparable period. ADI delivered a very strong first quarter, with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These results reflect the secular demand for ADI\u2019s products, capturing synergies and effectively passing on inflationary costs. Our manufacturing team is diligently securing additional internal and external capacity as orders remain robust across all our markets and our backlog continues to grow. This sets the stage for continued sequential growth through the balance of fiscal 2022. So for the first quarter, revenue of $2.68 billion finished near the high-end of our outlook, with double-digit growth across all end markets and geographies. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue and eighth straight of sequential growth. Looking at our end market performance for the quarter, industrial, our most diverse and profitable market, represented 50% of revenue and achieved a new all-time high. Industrial has grown more than 20% year-over-year for five straight quarters, underscoring our strong market positioning, supported by numerous secular tailwinds, including automation, digital healthcare, sustainable energy, aerospace and instrumentation. Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, with every major application posting double-digit year-over-year growth. Our battery management system offering continues to outperform and represents over 15% of automotive revenue, underscoring ADI\u2019s leadership in electric powertrains. Additionally, secular content growth inside the cabin continues to drive both the A2B and GMSL connectivity franchises to new heights. Communications represented 15% of revenue and exhibited strength in wireless and wireline. We are in the early days of 5G deployments and expect global rollouts, led by North America, to accelerate in 2022 and beyond. And in wireline, demand remains strong as carriers and hyperscalers continue to upgrade their cloud infrastructure from long-haul to datacenter. And lastly, consumer represented 14% of revenue and was in line with seasonality. Importantly, we continue to grow year-over-year, supported by strategic investments aimed at diversifying our customer and application mix. The first quarter demonstrated our increased portfolio breadth as all segments achieved growth, including professional audio video, gaming, wearables, hearables and personal electronics. Now, looking at the P&L, gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-over-year, resulting in a record 71.9%. Favorable product mix, higher utilizations and synergies were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $702 million, better than anticipated due to faster synergy progress. Operating margin of 45.8% increased 510 basis points year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $44 million in line with last quarter. And our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 13%. All told, adjusted EPS of $1.94 increased 35%. Our record profitability this quarter was driven by the stronger revenue growth as well as the synergy capture. And now moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and equivalents. And on a trailing 12-month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was just under one turn. Days of inventory increased modestly sequentially to 115 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7 to 8-week target. Looking at cash flow items, CapEx was $111 million for the quarter and $387 million over the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, during fiscal 2022, we plan to invest 6% to 8% of revenue to significantly grow our front and back-end capacity and build a more resilient hybrid manufacturing model for the long-term. Importantly, this higher level of CapEx will not hinder our capital return commitments. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.78 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Our free cash flow margin was lower by about 3% due to costs related to the Maxim acquisition. Over the same time period, we returned approximately $4.2 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow via purchases and dividends. And as a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to use 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to consistently grow our dividend, with the remaining free cash flow used for share repo. And just yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases. We have now raised our dividend 19x in the past 18 years. Our ASR program concluded in the first quarter, and as a result, we retired approximately 14.4 million shares. We are now more than halfway towards executing our $5 billion repo commitment by the end of calendar 2022. So let me finish with the second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint, we expect all B2B markets to grow sequentially and for consumer to be flattish. At the midpoint, operating margin is expected to be 46.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And this outlook includes approximately $100 million of annual run rate synergies, split roughly evenly between cost of goods and OpEx as we exit second quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%. So based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be around $2.07, plus or minus $0.10. And finally, let me end with an invitation. We are holding our Investor Day on April 5, where we look forward to sharing ADI\u2019s long-term strategy, our new financial model and a detailed update on all phases of our synergy road map. We hope to see many of you in person at our headquarters right outside of Boston, where we will offer unique customer-led interactive technology demonstrations and displays throughout the day. This includes showcasing our wireless battery management system for EVs and much more. I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike for the Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Let\u2019s get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, we have our first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. And good to see the strong execution. Vince, I was hoping you could maybe give us a readout of what you see as kind of the supply-demand balance in your different end markets. And if \u2013 as part of that, if you could help us understand what role is pricing playing in the industry today. And can it be sticky over time? Or will it need to revert back as there is more trailing-edge capacity that comes online, including from your other large U.S. competitor? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Good morning, Vivek, I\u2019m going to just do the setup for that on the supply and demand environment. So what we\u2019re seeing in 2022 looks a lot like 2021. So we expect that we will be chasing demand throughout the year. We\u2019ve got continued order strength across the business. As I said in the prepared remarks, all end markets, all geographies are looking strong. And our backlog is continuing to expand. We\u2019ve delivered eight sequential quarters of growth, and that\u2019s supported by the manufacturing team continued to increase their ability to supply. And as I mentioned in the remarks, we expect that increase to be progressive over the balance of the year while they continue to debottleneck the process. So that will help us drive sequential growth. From a supply standpoint, we\u2019re going to continue to look at the balance here and keep an eye on how things are going. But our view is that this will run through the balance of this year. And we expect that we will probably still have a little bit of catching up to do in early \u201823. On pricing, that\u2019s a longer question, so let me split that into two pieces. Why don\u2019t I talk margins and then I\u2019ll let Vince talk kind of pricing strategy. So from margins, we along with the rest of the industry have been passing on the higher costs that we\u2019ve been seeing. So we\u2019re not using this environment to take advantage of customers, but really targeting to maintain gross margins. So we have been pushing those costs out. But built into those margins is a number of items, including the synergy execution, which is coming in faster than we thought, some benefit of mix, higher revenue because we are actually shipping more units. So I think on a quarterly basis, unit shipment is up double-digits year-over-year. And then, of course, with all this unit increase in unit shipment, utilizations are also quite strong. So there is a number of benefits that are underlying the margin piece. But to finish off on pricing, I\u2019m going to pass to Vince to maybe talk about how we\u2019re \u2013 how he\u2019s talking to customers. Vincent Roche : Yes. Vivek, just to add a couple of other color comments here. So we have historically managed our pricing to reflect the value that we deliver to our customers. We get an innovation premium for our products. And also, we have very, very long life products in our portfolio. And customers pay us to keep security of supply for the long-term. And that\u2019s an approach that we intend to keep in perpetuity. I think also, pricing for us is more structural than cyclical. I think the last couple of years have really brought semiconductors from the background into the foreground and shown the importance of semiconductors to the modern digital economy. And I think customers understand the value in a more meaningful way. So I think, as Prashanth said, cost inflation, we\u2019re in the post-Moore\u2019s Law era, cost inflation, I think, is going to be a long-term facet of the economic dynamic of the semiconductor business. So I expect that cost increases will moderate, but there will be inflation, I think, for the medium to long-term here. So I think when you put it all together, the industry is in a better place to capture more of the value that it\u2019s been generating over these many, many decades. And then I think we will benefit from that as a company based on the quality of our innovation, but also the new dynamics in the industry. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks for that, Vivek. Nest question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Good afternoon. And good morning, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Just to follow-up on the pricing side of things, Vince. I\u2019m just kind of curious, will this year\u2019s revenue growth be more influenced by pricing than last year? And to the extent that the price environment seems to be structurally changing, are there any parameters you can give us? Historically, pricing did x, and now we think it\u2019s going to do sort of x plus. And because \u2013 and the reason why I asked the question is we look at your relative growth rates to some of the end markets that you participate in, and you\u2019re clearly growing significantly faster. And there is a content side of things. But that relative growth does kind of make people concerned about inventory levels. And so we look at inventory and revenue, we probably should be looking at it on units. I\u2019m just kind of curious how we should try to factor in that pricing dynamic. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: John, let me just set the numbers on that. So this year, pricing or \u2013 actually, I should say, for the current quarter, pricing counts for less than half the growth. So that kind of helps you size it. And we had said on the prior quarter\u2019s call that in 2021, we had cost increases that were coming at us faster than we were able to push price out because we were in the process of closing the deal on Maxim and beginning the integration. So we did expect more pricing tailwind this year because we actually had inflationary cost headwind last year. Vincent Roche : Yes. I\u2019d say, John, one other comment. I\u2019ve said many, many times before that for several years up to this step function increase due to inflation in prices and cost of goods and then prices, our pricing was \u2013 for many, many years, we had been \u2013 we had to fill a gap. We had to ship more units to keep up with the annual price reductions. I would say we were accentuating towards zero price reduction on the average, adding more ASPs to our products for the innovation that we\u2019re creating. And then I think that for the long-term is going to be a better way to gauge ADI\u2019s pricing methodology. So we\u2019re pricing for value. And we\u2019re injecting significant amounts of R&D into the company to make sure that we keep ahead of our customers\u2019 needs. So that will be, I think, the primary dynamic for value capture for ADI for the years ahead. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, John. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Pradeep Ramani with UBS. Pradeep Ramani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about your automotive business just given how automotive production is sort of sharply rebounding in 2022. How do you feel about how much your automotive business can outgrow SAAR or even production in 2022? How should we think about that? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think right now, the supply chain is very, very lean. That is pretty well established. I\u2019ve talked with a lot of automotive companies over the last 6 months or so. And my sense is that everything that we\u2019re shipping has been used and I don\u2019t see any stockpiling. So content in vehicles is increasing every year. The value generation activity in the auto sector now is \u2013 it\u2019s driven by semiconductors and software. So we\u2019re seeing content growth of 5% to 10% per year. And I think that will continue for the foreseeable future. We are seeing, I think, the shift towards EVs. I\u2019ve been surprised by the speed of the shift myself in the 2021 period. And that our customers are tilting the content, the semiconductor content towards premium models. So that accelerates the content growth story versus history. And then long-term, we expect to be able to grow our business in the automotive sector as a multiple of SAAR. We see tremendous opportunity to continue to drive our share and growth story of EVs. In cabin connectivity where we\u2019ve got a very, very strong signal processing franchise, to which we\u2019ve connected our A2B connectivity, road noise cancellations, a new value creator in the cabin. And we\u2019re very excited by the GMSL, the connectivity portfolio, the high-speed connectivity portfolio that we have inherited from legacy Maxim. And we have aggressive plans to continue to build that out, both in terms of product development as well as our manufacturing footprint. And last but not least, power. We are underrepresented in general in power management, I\u2019d say, across the industry, and particularly in automotive and industrial. So, I think the combined portfolio of ADI and Maxim gives us a tremendous opportunity to tap in to what is actually the largest sector. Power is the largest sector of the analog market, and it\u2019s growing at a compounded rate there. So, that gives you a sense for our automotive thinking. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the strong execution. Prashanth, I wanted to ask about your synergy capture in the quarter and how to think about synergies going forward. In your prepared remarks, I think you talked about earlier than expected synergy capture. Should we consider this as kind of a pull-in of synergies, or would it be fair to assume that the Phase 1 target of $275 million is a little bit more on the conservative side? And then, I guess additionally, on Phase 2, I realize it\u2019s kind of early. But you had talked about potentially looking at your manufacturing footprint similar to how you did with the linear. Is that still the plan, or could things change given the stronger demand backdrop? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Good question, Toshi. And a great setup to invite folks to join us in April when we are going to answer all those questions. The \u2013 in the last call, we talked about $20 million of synergies was realized in fourth quarter. And we said that there would be minimal impact in the first half before ramping more aggressively into the second half. We have moved faster than originally planned and we have captured more earlier. So, we are going to exit second quarter at about $100 million of that $275 million. And as I have said in the remarks, it\u2019s roughly split between both cost of goods and OpEx. The \u2013 we will give you an update on that $275 million in terms of how much we believe we can actually achieve in that first Phase 1 time period. We will do that at the April earning \u2013 Investor Day. Vivek will also specifically talk about his plans and what he is \u2013 has high confidence on for Phase 2 of the cost synergies. And then our Head of \u2013 our Chief Customer Officer is going to talk about the revenue synergies that we are expecting from the combination. So, we will lay all that out for you when we see you here in Boston in a couple of weeks. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about gross margin. So, I hear what you are saying on pricing. It sounds like it\u2019s a revenue boost, but not so much a margin boost yet. But I just look at the company, ADI standalone was kind of 70 to maybe low-70s, Maxim was kind of mid to high-60s. And you are doing 72% out of the gate. Is this mostly just utilization and mix and the synergies? And it sounds like you have got more synergies coming. You have got revenue going through the year. Should we be thinking about the current gross margin level you just put in Q1 as sort of being the bottom for the year as you continue to progress? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Stacy, let me just clarify, that I would be incorrect to assume that there was no benefit from pricing in the gross margins. What I wanted to clarify earlier in the response was, embedded in that margin improvement is the synergy, the faster synergy execution, which I just answered in Toshiya\u2019s question. The mix, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, again, very strong industrial at 50%, is great for us. And then higher unit volume, because we are up on a unit basis double-digits, and utilization, and then pricing also fits into that. So, they are all elements of that. In terms of how to think about the gross margin on a go-forward basis, we will share the new operating model or the financial model for the company in April. But I will preview to say that our focus continues to be on how do we drive the best revenue growth balancing that gross margin. So, as we have met with investors, there is pretty uniform agreement that what they would like to see is higher revenue growth and make the trades that are necessary on margin to be able to deliver higher revenue growth. So, we will talk more about the model in Investor Day. But I would not be encouraging folks to be modeling very high gross margin numbers over the long-term. Michael Lucarelli : Gross margins, Stacy, and how it trends, we don\u2019t guide gross margins, but I will give you some context around. If you look at 2Q, it\u2019s usually up a bit. That\u2019s embedded in our outlook. In the back half, usually about flat from there. That kind of helps you from a kind of near-term 2022 outlook. And then at the Investor Day, we will talk more about the long-term outlook for the business. Stacy Rasgon : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the record results. Could you just talk a little bit more about your capacity plans? You talked about increasing CapEx 6% to 8% this year. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s sort of the first year or more to come. And is there any way for you to quantify what that does as far as capacity expansion? I know you have a hybrid model and this is a moving target. But any color you can share with us on how much capacity you are going to have? That would be great. Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. So thanks, Tore. The \u2013 well, first off, if we just take it from a high level, first, we have always utilized a hybrid manufacturing model at ADI. And it gives us the reach of process technology and capabilities that we need to support the sheer breadth of our portfolio, which is more than 75,000 unique product sets. And we are supplying 125,000 customers. So, I think when we think about the long-term, we will continue to use the benefits of this hybrid model for optionality, resilience and the availability of technology. So overall, the business that we are in, it is \u2013 and given that we are approaching the world with a hybrid mentality, our business is less capital intensive. And it also gives us, as I said, resiliency in terms of gross margin and long-term access to more options for process technology, etcetera, etcetera. So, I will hand it over to Prashant. He will make a few comments on the investments that we are making and how we are going to strengthen that model. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Tore, I think your question was specifically related to CapEx. So, let me just \u2013 let me kind of size that at a high level. So, we said that our CapEx is going to be doubling in 2022. And we are targeting somewhere between 6% to 8%, which is above our historical long-term rate of 4%. And that CapEx is being used for internal capacity. Specifically, that can swing in and out, so it helps us with optionality. And that\u2019s an important element of the hybrid manufacturing model that Vince talked about is being able to use that same capacity for volume when we need it or utilization if the market should not have the same level of demand as they do today. So, the shelves of the building are complete. And Vince mentioned in his prepared remarks that we were adding in \u2013 expanding our footprints in Oregon and Limerick. And also, we are adding a significant amount of testers to our back end in the Phils, Thailand and the LTC site that we acquired in Malaysia. Tore Svanberg : Great. Helpful. Thank you. Vincent Roche : Thanks Tore. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. Prashanth, I wanted to come back to the inventory. On a GAAP basis, which is consistently how we measure for all companies, it\u2019s pretty low versus the average and versus the long-term target that you have laid out. And on an absolute dollar basis, it was down quite a bit as well. So, I was just wondering, part of it is probably from the accounting and the step-up you had from the Maxim acquisition. Could you just help us understand, was there a drawdown internally? And I don\u2019t think I heard you talk about where channel inventory was. So, what should we expect inventory to do on an absolute dollar basis as we go through the year? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, great question, Ambrish. So first, let me say that you are absolutely right. There is a bunch of purchase accounting that is flowing through the balance sheet. So, the inventory numbers probably have a bit more noise, and we can handle that with your team offline. But let me high level kind of help folks to think about the inventory. So, the channel remains very, very lean. That is not the \u2013 not our balance sheet, but the inventory in the channel, that remains very lean, well below our seven-week to eight-week target. We are having difficulty building inventory in the channel. We get it into the channel, and it moves out very quickly. Within ADI\u2019s books, our days of inventory are up slightly, primarily, as I mentioned that we are planning to see revenue increase sequentially for the balance of the year. So, you have the raw material and the WIP is in \u2013 is sort of in the middle of the process now before that comes out, and that is \u2013 that\u2019s up. We also had a little bit of finished goods up, but that was purely timing on when the quarter ended versus where the goods were in the transit process. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into our increase in finished goods, except to say it\u2019s just \u2013 it happened to be when the Drawbridge closed for the quarter. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Ambrish. We will go to our last question, please. Operator : Alright. Our last question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results and execution. If I look at cloud and hyperscale data center CapEx spending for this year, that\u2019s expected to grow like 30%. And I know that in the data center end market, Maxim, for example, they provide the critical processor power management for NVIDIA\u2019s data center GPUs. They provide power management for Google\u2019s flagship AI processors. On the ADI side, you guys provide server power supply solutions and optical networking solutions. So, I guess my question is, given the strong backdrop, was data center a big driver for your comps business in Q1? How do you see data center growth for the full year? And how big is data center as a percent of your overall comm business? Michael Lucarelli : I will answer backwards. I will start with kind of the sizing of data center for you. If you look at our comms business, it\u2019s about 15% of total revenue. That\u2019s split about evenly between wireless and wireline, about 50%, 50% in each of those. And if you look at the wireline piece, that\u2019s where data center is embedded, it\u2019s probably about 30% to 35% of that relates to the data center. What do we ship into this, I know you outlined it pretty well. I am not going to go through it again. But I will pass it to Vincent and Prashant, probably Vince to talk a little bit more about what the opportunity is in data center and why we are excited. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks Mike. Well, we have I consider, combined with Maxim, a strong position in optical connectivity as well as carrier networks, but also power management, whether it\u2019s the power system monitoring, energy monitoring and actually power delivery itself. We see that as a phenomenal opportunity. So, my sense is, and we will talk more about this at the Investor Day, but we will unpack the story for you. But my sense is that we can double our data center and cloud business over the next 4 years to 5 years. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Alright. Thank you, Harlan. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript and all of our reconciliations will be available on our website. We hope you can join us at our in-person at Investor Day, April 5. Thanks for joining the call and interest in Analog Devices. Have a good day.

I would like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Katrina, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2022 call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are also included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI delivered another quarter of record revenue, profitability and earnings, driven by continued insatiable demand for our products, strong operational execution and accelerated synergy capture.  Moreover, amidst a dynamic macro environment, we're operating from a position of remarkable strength, supported by our record backlog, robust bookings and ongoing capacity expansions, which position us favorably as we enter the second half. Now moving to a summary of our results. Revenue was $2.97 billion, above the high end of our outlook and up 28% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Strength was broad-based with all segments up double digits year-over-year. Impressively, adjusted gross margin expanded to 74% and operating margin to 50%. Adjusted EPS was $2.40, exceeding the high end of outlook and increasing over 50% from the year ago period. Overall, I'm very excited with our performance and our team's outstanding execution. Today, I'd like to reinforce what we shared at our Investor Day around how our markets are evolving and how we're investing to solve more of our customers' problems while also improving on our business model that's both rich with growth opportunities and, indeed, resiliency. The next wave in the evolution of the ICT sector is the nascent Intelligent Edge revolution. It will be characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale computing and pervasive connectivity, pushing processing and intelligence closer to the edge. Semiconductors are the bedrock enabling this next wave. And ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this revolution. At our core, we're an innovation-driven enterprise over the last decade through both robust organic investments and strategic M&A. We've built the industry's broadest and highest performance analog, mixed signal and power portfolio. Our offerings span from microwave to bits, nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud and increasingly from components to subsystems.  Our vast arsenal of technologies, along with the deep level of engagement and support we provide our customers, has earned us the number 1 positions in analog, mixed signal, RF and high-performance power. This, coupled with our focus on customer success, awards ADI with an innovation premium that is reflected in our ASPs that are more than 3x the industry average and also industry-leading gross margins. The growing scope of our customers' products is dramatically expanding in complexity and pressuring their product development teams and innovation cycles. To meet these challenges and deliver the next wave of disruptive innovations, we're investing over $1.6 billion in R&D annually. These investments strengthen our broad market franchise and enable us to expand our SAM and vertical applications where more complete solutions are necessary. We achieved this by integrating our core analog technologies with increasing levels of digital algorithms and software. Now let's look at how our technology is intersecting with our markets. Industries like transportation, energy, telecoms, manufacturing and health care are prioritizing digitalization. This is driving new generations of applications and fueling a host of concurrent secular growth trends, and I'd like to touch on just a few now. Starting with automotive. Here, ADI is the market leader in battery management systems, for example, for EVs. Our battery management systems, or BMS, solutions offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability, safety and security. Our wireless BMS solution offers all the benefits of wired but also enables rapid battery pack configurability and cost-effective scaling of our customers' EV fleets. This innovative solution continues to gain traction in the market and adds to our content per system by up to 2x. Moving to communications, where ADI is the market leader in radio signal chains for 5G with a majority share across the ecosystem. Our latest generation transceiver includes a fully integrated digital front end and grows our SAM by 2x. This innovative radio architecture reduces system cost and waste and improves power efficiency. Further, the flexibility of these software-defined solutions allows them to be used across traditional 5G networks as well as an emerging Open RAN and LEO satellite networks. Lastly, health care. We have a number 1 position with dominant share in medical imaging, for example. Subsystems like our photons to bits module are used by the top CT players in the world. Our solution delivers the highest-fidelity images while decreasing radiation dosage. And in the process, it allows us to capture 4x the SAM compared to offering just components alone. In addition to expanding our innovation edge across these secular trends to amplify growth, the Maxim combination creates a $1 billion revenue synergy opportunity for us over the next 5 years. The first opportunity arises from customer cross-selling, leveraging our complementary relationships to pull through our extended portfolio.  Second is fusing together the new product road maps of these 2 premier Analog portfolios to push the boundaries of what's possible.  And third is power management. Here, the combination with Maxim increases our breadth of power capabilities, creates a more cost competitive portfolio and adds to our engineering talent pool. As a result, we unlocked $4 billion of additional power SAM and look to double our power revenue in the years ahead. The proliferation of the Intelligent Edge and our revenue synergy opportunity gives me great confidence that we can bend the growth curve upwards, moving from our historical mid-single-digit growth rate to our new model of 7% to 10%. Now I'd like to speak a little to the unique resiliency of our business. The diversity of our portfolio is a source of great strength. We shipped 75,000 product SKUs, which support thousands of applications to over 125,000 customers. Notably, 80% of our revenue is derived from products that individually contribute no more than 0.1% of total revenue. And the longevity of our products is unmatched. On average, our products have life spans of a decade or more, effectively delivering recurring revenue streams for decades. It's these characteristics that create a high barrier to entry and an enduring business model. Finally, we utilize a geographically diverse hybrid manufacturing strategy to attain the complexity and fragmentation of the Analog market. This strategy provides us with a broad array of technology and packaging necessary to create innovative solutions from 7 nanometers to 7 micrometers. At the same time this model creates a diverse network of internal and external partners to best manage our operations through economic cycles.  As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost-effective model. To that end, we're doubling the capacity of our internal factories and adding significant capital to our product test operations. These investments will grow our output this year and into 2023 and increase our swing capacity across our network to over 70% of revenue. So in closing, ADI is a leader in innovating at the edge, and I believe that our best days are still ahead of us as we drive increased value for our customers, shareholders and society.  And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financial detail. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. It was great to see and hear from so many of you at our Investor Day last month, and it was also exciting to welcome so many of our customers to demonstrate our technologies in action. As usual, my comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We printed another very impressive quarter with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These strong results reflect increasing demand for our highly differentiated products aligned to multiple secular trends as well as our ability to leverage our hybrid manufacturing model, offset inflation and accelerate synergy capture. Second quarter revenue of $2.97 billion finished above the high end of our outlook, with every B2B end market exceeding initial expectations. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue and our ninth straight sequential growth period. So let's look at the performance by end market. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, represented 51% of revenue and hit another all-time high. We experienced broad-based growth with digital health care, automation, instrumentation and test leading the way, underscoring increasing content and our strong position in these secular markets. Industrial has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 6 straight quarters. Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, also achieved another record with all applications growing double digits year-over-year. In BMS, where we hold the number 1 position, our quarterly revenue eclipsed $100 million for the first time. We expect strong growth to persist, given the momentum in the market and our continued design wins. Additionally, our A2B and GMSL solutions, which together make up roughly 20% of automotive, continued on their secular growth path fueled by the digitalization of the automobile. Communications represented 16% of revenue with robust broad-based growth. In wireless, we experienced growing demand across our RF portfolio as 5G deployments, particularly in North America, gained momentum. ADI's latest generation transceiver, which Vince spoke to, is ideally positioned to capitalize on the virtualization trend. In wireline, demand for our optical and power products remained strong as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for bandwidth.  And lastly, the consumer represented 12% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 6 straight quarters. This consistent growth is a function of our product and customer breadth, which better insulates us from the typical fluctuations associated with PCs and portable devices. Now on to the P&L. Gross margin was a record 74.2%, increasing 230 basis points sequentially and 330 basis points year-over-year. Favorable product mix, high utilization and revenue growth and synergy fall-through were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $710 million, better than anticipated, owing to faster synergy execution. Record operating margins of 50.3% grew 450 basis points sequentially and 860 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, we've realized over $250 million of cost synergies. We look to quickly achieve the remaining synergies and hit our recently increased target of $400 million in savings exiting fiscal '23. Non-op expenses were $41 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at a record $2.40, up more than 50% versus the second quarter 2021. And now on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased sequentially to 122 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target. If we look at cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $119 million and $447 million over the trailing 12 months or 5% of revenue. To support our accelerated 7% to 10% long-term revenue growth outlook, we are strategically investing to expand internal capacity while enhancing the resiliency of our hybrid model. To that end, as we stated at Investor Day, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be in the high single digits during fiscal '22 and '23 before reverting back to 4% to 6% over the long term. And over the trailing 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime transaction-related costs amounting to about 3% of revenue. Given the recent market weakness, we accelerated our repo activity to $776 million during the second quarter. This brings our total share repurchase to approximately $3.5 billion since the close of Maxim. And we look to maintain this accelerated buyback pace this quarter and achieve our $5 billion commitment by the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We will allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR throughout the cycle, with the remaining cash used for buybacks to reduce share count annually. And now on to the outlook for third quarter. Revenue is expected to be $3.05 billion, plus or minus $100 million. We expect all end markets to grow sequentially. Given our higher-than-normal annual merit increase, operating margin is expected to be 49.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And our tax rate is expected to be between 13% and 14%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.42, plus or minus $0.10. While we are very mindful of the current economic trends, our demand indicators remain very strong and our customer conversations remain upbeat, giving us confidence for continued growth for the remainder of 2022 and likely into 2023. Importantly, as a result of our vast diversification, leadership in numerous secular growth markets, additional synergies and our resilient hybrid manufacturing model, we believe ADI has never been better positioned to transcend cyclical downturns and accelerate long-term growth. Let me now give it back to Mike to start the Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, Katrina, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Congratulations on all the record results, especially on that 50% operating margin. My question is for Vince. Vince, towards the end of your remarks, you talked about growing output to increase swing capacity to 70% of revenues. Could you perhaps elaborate a little bit on that? And what is sort of the time line exactly for when you would hit that number? Vincent Roche : Yes. So as you know, Tore, we've been investing in our internal semiconductor manufacturing operations from 0.18 micron upwards, and we're doubling the output there over the next year or thereabouts, a year or 15 months. And of course, we cross-license technologies with some of our foundry partners. So when we talk about a 70% swing, it means that because we will have cross-qualified so many process technologies between ADI internal fabs and the external fabs that are controlled by our foundry partners, we got the ability to move utilization, if you like, from 1 place to another, depending on what part of the cycle we're in, in terms of managing utilization inside ADI and being able to meet the demand as it surges or declines. Operator : And your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : I wanted to ask about the gross margins. You mentioned a bunch of drivers, but you actually didn't mention pricing at all in your outlook there for the driver side. I mean, what impact has pricing had either to offset inflation or to potentially reprice the Maxim portfolio after the closure? And I guess, how do we think about the forward gross margin trajectory at these current, like, revenue levels? I mean, is there room for it to even go up from here, assuming the revenue levels kind of stay on the current trajectory? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you for the question. So as you know, we, along with the rest of the industry, has been passing along the higher costs. We have been very focused on not using this environment to take advantage of our customers but to really maintain our gross margins. So in '21, we had some headwind from the timing of inflation versus when we were able to enact the pricing. This has really abated in '22. So really, the gross margin percentage and the growth in gross margin percentage that you see is really being driven, as I mentioned, by the synergies, great utilization at the internal fabs and some mix benefits. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about industrial hitting 51% of the overall revenue mix. So for the forward look, we updated our model just a couple of weeks back, and we feel very comfortable that in a typical cycle trough, we are going to be able to maintain a 70% floor. Beyond that, we will continue to make the right trade-offs with opportunities to expand the top line and -- at some trade-off on gross margin. So really the focus for the team is deliver the revenue growth and let that leverage drive all the way down through cash flow. So I wouldn't encourage folks to look for significant margin expansion. These are already pretty incredible numbers. Stacy Rasgon : But if the revenues kind of stay at this trajectory, can at least the gross margins stay where they are or will they just fluctuate around? Will like mix be the biggest driver from here? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, that's the right way to think about it, yes. Michael Lucarelli : You're right. If you look at our build margins at this point going forward, it's mix, utilization and then we also have the $125 million of synergies, some of that will be on the cost of goods sold side. As Prashanth laid out, we'll balance both gross margins really to drive operating margins and free cash flow. Operator : And your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Vince, I think or Prashanth mentioned that industrial sales have grown over, I believe, it's over 25% for the last 6 quarters and seem like they could be strong for another 2 or 3 quarters. I'm curious, how do you think about the normalized growth rate? And what macro indicators do you look at to say this is what ADI's industrial growth should be? Like what are the early signals that you get to give you a sense whether you're over- or under-shipping end demand? Because from the outside, we look at all the turmoil in China, we look at all the turmoil in Europe, but then we look at this very strong industrial growth number and it gets harder to kind of reconcile, right, these 2 narratives. So give us a sense for how do you feel about specifically your industrial business right now? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Vivek. So first and foremost, it's a highly diversified industrial business that we've been diligently investing in from an R&D perspective, from a customer engagement perspective over the last decade or 12 years with a renewed focus. We've been gaining share very, very clearly. I think our portfolio, particularly combined with the power activity as well from the LTC and Maxim acquisitions puts us in even better stead to capture more SAM essentially. And to your question on growth, I would say that we -- during the Investor Day, we said that the new model is 7% to 10%. So I think industrial is going to be right in there somewhere over time. And we feel more confident now, I think, about our industrial growth than we've ever done, just given the strength of the portfolio, the customer engagements and so on. And in terms of the signals we watch, obviously, we have a lot of conversations with our customers. I personally have had a stream of conversations with many of our largest industrial customers over the last quarter. And I think what they're all trying to convey to us is that things are different. We're moving into a new industrial cycle, Industry 4.0, 5.0, IoT, or I beg your pardon, IT and OT, if you like, colliding in a new partnership for the future, driving a lot of new technologies. So that's one, obviously 1 stream of input we get. The other signals we look at, obviously, are the PMIs, the machine to builders indexes and so on and so forth. Well, I think the greatest source of insight for us is our own knowledge of the end applications coupled with our customers' insights. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Vivek, maybe I'll just add. I think I said it in the remarks, but to be clear to everyone, our growth in industrial was broad. All applications hit record results in '21 and are on track to hit another record in '22. Operator : Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: I guess a comment on my side. With these results, I'm surprised you didn't have Big Papi and Tom Brady at your Analyst Day. So next time. So to my question, your results are much better than your peers. Your B2B business, I think, up 11% versus your peers [at] mid-single digits. How do you think about the outperformance there? Is a part of that your ability to source incremental supply, market share gains, right mix? Would love to hear your thoughts there. And then as you think about the future going into the second half of this year and next, how does that inform your vision for continued outperformance? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then hand to -- hand over to Vince. So on the tactical side, we are working on getting additional capacity both from our external partners as well as the investments we're making internally. So you'll see that continue to play out over the course of the year, which is why I mentioned in the prepared remarks, look for us to continue to grow sequentially through this year and likely at least into the early part of next year. We talked about pricing that has been a little bit incremental to the revenue growth. So that's certainly a piece of it. And the demand has just been very broad-based. And again, I said it in my remarks but to be clear, we are seeing demand across all end markets and all geographies. It's very evenly spread and strength across all end applications. So we do feel, to Vince's remarks here, we do feel very well positioned and our technology is really starting to hit the sweet spot across all of our customers. And then maybe I'll pass here to Vince to add some more. Vincent Roche : Maybe just a little bit of color on the markets, C.J., to try and answer your question. So we have so many vectors of growth now, for example, in industrial, where we're basically playing on all the high-end applications. And as I said, we've been tuning the R&D continuously, the customer engagement. And if I just pick out health care as an example, that's beginning to get on to a $1 billion run rate now. It's been growing consistently for the last 7, 8 years in the -- at the double-digit level. Aerospace and defense, we see that actually, no matter what the cycle will be over the next few years, this is going to be an area of great strength for us. And in the communications area, great position in 5G. But interestingly, our wireline and data center business now is on a par with the wireless sector in terms of revenue contribution. So it's kind of half-and-half. So we see that again as a source of strength, buttressed also by a lot of the technologies that Maxim are bringing to that wireline area. Automotive, we have a great story on the in-cabin experience with A2B, cancellation, premium sign systems being more and more deployed, electrification. We're on a [100] a quarter run rate now, revenue run rate. And we have design-ins at virtually all the electric car companies at this point in time. So we see that on a trajectory to $1 billion-plus in the foreseeable future. So that's just some of the examples to complement what Prashanth has narrated as well in terms of the vectors of growth and prosperity for the company. Operator : Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : I had a question on the cost synergies, Prashanth. How should we be modeling these on a go-forward basis? You said exiting fiscal '23, but what's the breakout? And then kind of related to that is when we're talking about gross margin, I was a little bit surprised that you said the inflationary pressure would be abating as we go into -- as we continue through this year. Did I catch that right? Because inflation, the headline numbers seem to be -- they haven't -- maybe they have peaked but definitely higher than where they were last year. So would love some color on that comment as well. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. Two good questions, and thanks for giving me the opportunity to clarify. So first, on synergies. We had talked, when we did the Maxim closed that we had some great learnings from LTC on how to get to synergies and that was to move fast and hard, and you're seeing us execute against that strategy. So we captured basically the entire $275 million that we originally committed to as we exited our second quarter. And that at Investor Day, we said we're raising that target to $400 million, and we'll hit that number coming out of -- or as we exit 2023. That first $275 million was a little more tilted towards cost of goods, and the following piece will sort of be balanced between cost of goods and OpEx. So as you look forward, that's how to think about the balance of that. To your question on the comments I made, thank you for giving me a chance to clarify. We have used our pricing opportunities to maintain gross margin. So to be clear, we're not looking at pricing as an opportunity to expand gross margin but really as a way to offset. So when I said abate inflation, I meant versus the historical inflation that we had experienced in 2021. It took us a little bit longer to get those pricing actions in place. So now we have neutralized them and you see that benefit in the current year. And of course, if we do continue to see price increases -- sorry, cost increases in the coming quarters, expect us, like the rest of the industry, to respond by pushing those through. Ambrish Srivastava : So there's no artifact in the 74% that you reported this quarter for pricing? We should expect kind of that level on a go-forward basis, maybe bounce around based on mix and also the utilization rate? Michael Lucarelli : Ambrish, this is Mike. Yes, as we had talked about earlier, going forward, that 74% will bounce around, like you said, mixed utilization of the 2 drivers. And then as Prashanth outlined, that [1 25] does have a COGS element in it that will also help gross margins. But if you go forward 74%, plus/minus, I feel pretty good about that. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: With the caveat, again, I want to make it clear for everyone, with the caveat that we are focused on growth. So where it makes sense for us to be a little more flexible to drive top line, we will do that. So I wouldn't want folks getting too laser-focused on modeling in mid-70s on the gross margin. We've given you a floor and we will give the management team the flexibility they need to drive the top line. Ambrish Srivastava : Right. You've been very consistent about that. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely : So with all this talk on revenue growth, your forecasted sequential revenue growth for July is the slowest in a couple of years. Can you talk about why that's happening? And is that because of COVID shutdowns or something else? And then as part of that, with all this focus on increasing capacity, I would assume your capacity is growing faster than the 2% or 3% sequential revenue growth. So can we assume that the lead times are coming in this quarter as well? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. So Chris, the sequential growth is constrained by capacity. But we've indicated that we will see sequential growth through the year. So look for a more meaningful change as we get past the third quarter, which we've been saying for a while. So if you look back at prior comments, we've been very clear that we've ordered the tools and the equipment. We know our position in the queue. We know when those are coming in, and they go to revenue generation fairly quickly. So we are maintaining our outlook that we will exit the year at a much higher run rate than where we are now. And that is all driven by our ability to produce. And what was the second question? Chris Danely : Perfect. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Chris, I'll also add 1 thing. You're right, the sequential growth is, I'll call it, decelerating now. What happened in the first half of the year, we talked about, we added pricing and that added to the growth. We had volume and pricing in the first half of the year that's driving sequential. Pricing is really in the model now, now that the growth in the back half on a sequential basis is really driven by capacity and volume. And if you zoom out and don't look at sequentials and look at year-over-year, we're growing our B2B business in our fiscal third quarter by over 20% year-over-year again. So it's a fantastic result, I think, and it shows the strength of this franchise. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. I think we can give everyone the data point that on a sequential basis, think of it as 50-50. The growth is coming from pricing versus units. So that falls into the baseline sequentially as we go forward, pricing falls into the baseline. Operator : Your next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. William Stein : I\u2019ll add my congratulations to the very strong revenue and profitability and the outlook as well. That was great. But despite all that good stuff, there\u2019s a few factors that investors are certainly concerned about potentially disrupting bookings and potentially revenue performance, of course, the war in Ukraine, the COVID shutdowns in China and raising rates. But there\u2019s also a concern maybe not as prominent, but \u2013 that we\u2019ve picked up on, which is customers adjusting orders, potentially ancelling or pushing out because they\u2019re very challenged from a kitting perspective. You highlighted yourself that you\u2019re capacity constrained. Can you help us understand how those factors are affecting your business today and how you anticipate them playing out in your business over the next few quarters? Vincent Roche : Yes. So I think first and foremost, cancellations on ADI are very, very low. They\u2019re very muted. Customers \u2013 we\u2019ve been very equitable in terms of how we have moved our supply across the markets, across the geographies, across the customer sizes. And I think that still is in very, very good stead. So my sense is we have \u2013 because of the equitable distribution of our goods, so to speak, we\u2019ve got a better, more true read on demand. And I think what we\u2019re shipping reflects what is true demand, I think better than most, I believe, based on feedback I\u2019m getting from customers. So I think those are the facts, cancellations low, equitable distribution of goods. And we don\u2019t see any \u2013 our backlog is still, actually during the last quarter, increased so demand continues to remain strong. A \u2013Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Just the numbers. Well, the book-to-bill is above 1 in the second quarter, and that was, again, by all end markets and geographies. Because of that, the backlog continued to grow. You asked specifically about China. So real quickly, that\u2019s about 20% of our revenue. And the lockdowns had some impact on customer production, but it was really more severe around logistics and the supply chain related to the greater Shanghai area. Our China revenue was up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and no notable impacts to demand. Again, cancellations normal, and as I mentioned, book-to-bill above 1 for China. So when our guide reflects that most customers are operating at relatively normal levels and we consider this dynamic, so we think that at least for the third quarter, it\u2019s going to be a negligible impact. Vincent Roche : Yes. Just add a little bit of color. Also, we have no internal manufacturing operations in China. And from a logistics standpoint as well, we have very, very modest operations also in China. A \u2013 Michael Lucarelli : We\u2019ll go to our last question, please. Operator : Our last question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Toshi, are you on? Toshi may be on mute. Do we have 1 more in the queue? Michael Lucarelli : Do we have 1 more in the queue? Operator : Our next question is from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Gary Mobley : I wanted to ask a follow-up question on backlog. I think you mentioned that based on the backlog and adding incremental supply, your expectation is for sequential revenue growth for at least maybe the next few quarters, maybe 3, maybe 4 quarters. Wondering to what extent have you stress tested your backlog to see, I guess, under the most bearish of circumstances, how that may trend if perhaps we see further deterioration in the economic backdrop and whatnot? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Gary, a fair question. The -- as Vince mentioned, we look at a number of external indicators. So we are mindful of what's happening in the macro environment. But as you mentioned, the conversations that he has with our customers continue to support their need for our products and that we are attached to the right secular driver. So I do want to clarify, you had said sequential growth for the next 3 to 4 quarters. I can't see out that far, Gary. I feel good about the next 2 to 3 quarters sequential growth, but I'm not sure I want to go out further than that at this point. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. Thanks again for joining the call and your continued interest in Analog Devices. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd like now to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal 2022 call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, CEO Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor. analog.com. Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth and our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. Please note, we've also published our annual ESG report last quarter titled Future Forward. You can find it on the IR web page.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you, all. Well, I'm pleased to share that we executed very well amidst a dynamic macro backdrop. We delivered another quarter of record results, driven by continued operational excellence, strong financial discipline and resilient demand for our diverse portfolio of innovation-rich products. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year on a combined basis and above the midpoint of our outlook. Strength was broad-based with double-digit growth in every end market. Our third quarter profitability reflects ADI's innovation premium and strong operating leverage with gross and operating margins of 74% and 50%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.52 finished at the high end of our outlook, marking another new high. I'm exceptionally pleased with our results, and I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our success, and importantly, to the success of our customers. At ADI, innovation is ingrained in our culture, fueled by an unwavering commitment to robust R&D investments. Over the last 12 months, we've invested over $1. 7 billion in R&D. A key facet to our innovation-driven success is our dedication to extensive and deep customer engagements, which enables us to collaborate with them in solving their toughest problems. Now I'd like to share some recent customer highlights. In automotive, we reinforced our market-leading position in BMS with wins at two premium European auto manufacturers. One of these wins was with our wireless BMS solution. This marks the fourth OEM to adopt wireless BMS as customer interest continues to build for this unique technology. In sustainable energy, we announced a design win with Enel Group on the Quantum Edge device used to digitally monitor electric grids. ADI's unmatched precision measurement capabilities are critical to creating a more resilient and flexible grid to help advance efficient electrification globally. In health care, the recently released wireless hospital monitoring system by GE Healthcare in Europe uses ADI solutions across signal chain, power, RF MCUs and sensors. This wearable system enables wireless continuous monitoring to detect patient deterioration earlier, helping to improve outcomes. Today, I'd like to profile our $1.5 billion-plus consumer franchise, a business that plays an important role in our long-term profitable growth strategy. Given the recent negative data points surrounding the consumer end market, one may wonder why highlight this market now. But that's just the reason our consumer business is built differently. In the third quarter, we posted our seventh consecutive growth quarter. And while we are not immune to macro slowdown, we have aligned this business to the high end of the market where performance really matters and into applications where our differentiation is truly valued. The composition of our consumer franchise is indeed unique. Approximately 30% of our revenue comes from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-generation conferencing systems, professional audio/video and home theater. The remaining revenue in consumer relates to portables, including fast-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones. Taking a step back, over the last five years-plus, we have reconfigured our consumer business to increase diversity across customers, products and applications to better drive growth and limit volatility while enhancing profitability. The addition of Maxim further enhances our diversity and expanded our portfolio. Over this time, we've increased our product SKUs to just over 10,000 and expanded our customer count to more than 3,000. Importantly, the composition of this business is quite similar to our B2B markets, with no single product contributing more than a couple of percentage points to total ADI sales. The velocity of innovation in the consumer market is appealing. It allows us to accelerate technology development and commercialize solutions quickly at scale. Over time, we take these breakthrough solutions into other markets to create new waves of growth and drive strong profitability and cash flow. For example, we have leveraged our consumer audio expertise into the automotive market. This capability was demonstrated at our Investor Day where we showcased an electric vehicle with Dolby Atmos that uses our Shark DSP and software that was first proven in the consumer business. Additionally, we've also leveraged R&D investments from our core franchises into the consumer market. To that end, our high-precision converters and industrial instrumentation, for example, have been repurposed to solve similar challenges for stabilization in smartphone compass and pressure sensing in wearables. Not only have we created a highly diverse and profitable business but also one that is aimed at key growth drivers that position us to grow at a high single-digit rate over the long term. For example, our prosumer growth has been revitalized as companies implement future of work plans that encompass more immersive enterprise video conferencing. Here, the breadth of our portfolio across DSP, analog, mixed signal and power management enables us to solve the entire customer challenge from high-bandwidth connectivity to video resolution and sound quality. And turning now a moment to the portables market. In hearables, we shift into the majority of premium wireless stereo earbuds. Our newest offerings include software-augmented hearing algorithms and optimized power that reduces size and improves audio fidelity while increasing our value per system by over 3 times. In wearables, we're a leader in personal wellness products with our sensing solutions designed into over 50% of products today. There is a convergence of these personal wellness products and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring solutions that could unlock new opportunities for ADI. And in premium smartphones, we're expanding our share and content at key customers, which is providing us additional diversification and stimulating new growth vectors. An emerging opportunity is the metaverse. ADI's breadth of hardware, software algorithms and domain expertise gives us an ability to provide complete subsystem solutions. While we're still in the early days, of course, momentum is building, and we have design wins in multiple next-generation AR/VR headsets. Across all these consumer applications, power management is becoming ever more critical. Customers are adding more features into smaller spaces, while consumers are demanding longer battery life. Maxim doubled the size of our low-power portfolio and increased our consumer power SAM by over $1 billion. We're already beginning to see the cross-sell benefits of our complementary customer bases and synergistic portfolios with wins in both wearables and conferencing systems. So in summary, I'm very encouraged with the strides we've taken to reignite growth in our consumer business and with a record opportunity pipeline and significant synergy potential, I believe we're in a position to deliver consistent growth over the long term. Now before passing over to Prashanth, I'd like to make some comments on the current business environment. Obviously, the macro backdrop is dynamic and it's clear that we're at an inflection point. Economic conditions are beginning to impact demand with orders showing -- orders slowing later in the quarter and cancellations increasing slightly. Prashanth will provide additional details on these dynamics in his remarks. ADI successfully navigated macro challenges many, many times before in our 57-year history. We've created a premier analog franchise with an unmatched diversity of products, customers and applications. And we've invested in a hybrid manufacturing model that better adapts to demand fluctuations. These characteristics instil a resiliency into our business to mitigate market weaknesses, sustain profitability and enable investment in our business through economic cycles to focus on playing our long game. And with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Third quarter revenue of $3.1 billion finished above the midpoint of our outlook and marked our sixth consecutive quarterly record. If we look at third quarter end market performance, industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, hit another all-time high and represented 50% of growth -- excuse me, 50% of revenue. Growth was broad-based with each of our major applications increasing sequentially. Industrial revenue has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 7 straight quarters, underscoring ADI's strong position and secular content growth across applications. Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, increasing 28% year-over-year. The better mix of higher-content premium vehicles, combined with our growth engines of BMS, GMSL, A2B and better value capture is driving our outsized growth versus SAAR. Communications, which represented 16% of revenue, achieved a quarterly record with strong year-over-year growth in both wireless and wireline. Sequentially, wireline outpaced wireless with growing demand for our optical and power portfolios as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for data. And lastly, consumer represented 13% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 7 consecutive quarters. As Vince highlighted, the diversity and growing design momentum across portables and prosumer is enabling us to grow despite the consumer market slowdown. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 74. 1%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher utilization, favorable mix and synergy capture. OpEx in the quarter was $747 million, which reflects a full quarter of higher-than-normal merit increases. Operating margin increased 650 basis points year-over-year, finishing at 50.1% toward the high end of our outlook. Non-op was $48 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, EPS came in at a record $2. 52, up 47% versus the third quarter of 2021. On balance sheet, we ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased to 129, while channel inventory remains below the low end of our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. For cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $165 million and $526 million over the trailing 12 months, just under 5% of revenue. We continue to expect elevated CapEx investments through 2023 to support the strategic expansion of our hybrid manufacturing model. And these investments will strengthen our resiliency and support our long-term growth outlook of 7% to 10% CAGR. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated over $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime deal-related costs which amount to about 3% of revenue. With the intra-quarter volatility, we opportunistically increased repo activity to $906 million. And after approximately one year post the close of Maxim, we've repurchased $4.4 billion worth of shares, putting us on track to exceed our $5 billion commitment by the end of fiscal '22. Including dividend payments, we've returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders over the last 12 months or more than 6% of our market cap. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We target to allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR through the cycle, with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. Now before we move to the outlook, I want to provide some additional details around demand. In third quarter, our order book remained strong and backlog increased to a new record, stretching well into mid-2023. However, orders moderated later in the quarter, and as a result, book-to-bill was down from a quarter ago but still well above one. By market, we are seeing strength persist in both industrial and automotive, which together represent over two-thirds of our sales, while consumer and comms were a bit softer. We also saw a modest increase in cancellations and was not specific to any end market or geography. Given these dynamics, coupled with the macro backdrop, we believe it's prudent to take a more cautious stance. As such, we are only forecasting slight sequential revenue growth to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million, despite bookings, backlog and higher supply that would all suggest stronger growth. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to grow quarter-over-quarter. Op margin is expected to be 50.3%, plus or minus 70 bps. Our tax rate is expected to be 13% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2. 57, plus or minus $0.10. More broadly, while the macro backdrop is dynamic, our business has several aspects that position us quite well to manage further headwinds. These include our diverse end market exposure, coupled with strong secular drivers that will help buffer our top line. The flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model gives us confidence in maintaining our 70% gross margin floor. And we also have several OpEx layers to support our industry-leading margins and maintain a solid return of cash to our investors. So in closing, my confidence to our path of $15 of EPS in the next five years remains high. Let me now give it back to Mike for the Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Let's get to the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) With that, can we have our first question, please, Matt? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : I just wanted to clarify how much conservatism is in the Q4 outlook. And then a little bit longer term than that. What happens to the pricing lever as you start to see these bookings start to decelerate? Is pricing holding firm? Is it flat or down as customers start to think about next year? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thank you for the question, Vivek. Let me take the first part of that, and then maybe I'll let Vince speak to the pricing. So we've been talking for a couple of quarters now that we were expecting a meaning full increase and our ability supply in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve been building that with the installations of equipment to that we\u2019ve been having over the course of the year. So our supply -- our ability supply even access of the guide that we put out there. In addition, our backlog actually increased sequentially from -- into the third quarter to a new all-time record. And given kind of the strength in the backlog, the book-to-bill was still above one and increased supply, it's very logical we could print a bigger number. Having said that, we are very aware of the macro environment and a bit more softening in order activity that we saw towards the tail end of the quarter. So that's why we kind of held back a little bit on the guide to ensure that if this order softness does continue, we're not disappointing. Vince, do you want to address the pricing question? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Vivek. Yes, so I think first and foremost, we are seeing tremendous stability. I don't expect to see any downward pressure on prices even in a recessionary environment. I think first and foremost, our products reflects an innovation premium for the kind of value that we deliver to our customers. Now we're never the long pull in the pricing tent either in the customer's bill of material. The other thing I would say, particularly in the high-performance analog space, the substitution costs are very, very high. So the disruption to a customer system design way, way outweighs considerations for price reduction. So where we obviously compete most intensively on a price basis is to get the original socket, but we have long life cycle products with tremendous stability, very, very high substitution costs. So my sense is that pricing will remain very, very steady through the cycle. Operator : Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess I'd like to focus on the slowdown in orders that you saw at the tail end of the quarter as well as the cancellations that you highlighted. Any more kind of detail you can provide there as it relates to subsegment of end markets, geography? Any color would be greatly appreciated. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thank you. Thanks, C.J. Let me maybe talk about kind of the bookings momentum in a couple of different pieces. So first, third quarter results, where we're clearly broad-based strength, all end markets were up quarter-over-quarter and double digits year-over-year, so our sixth consecutive record. The only geography/market that was down year-over-year was China consumer. But that's a very small exposure for ADI, low -- very low exposure for ADI, low -- very low the third quarter, orders were up. Again, as I mentioned, strongest trends were industrial and auto, which represent about 70% of the business. Comms and consumer weaker, but again, we increased our backlog to another record, another new all-time high, and that covers us well into '23. Where we saw that change in demand was really cancellations ticked modestly higher. And I do say modestly. It is -- we want to be fully transparent on this call, so we're calling out but I wouldn't really put too much focus on the cancellation number. But again, in the spirit of transparency, we want to share that we did see that change in the demand profile. And we also saw that the channel sell-through began to moderate towards later in the quarter. So that is the sell-through from the channel or POS began to soften a bit versus what we were originally expecting. Overall, the book-to-bill was still above parity but it was definitely lower than it was a quarter ago. So as we set that guide for fourth quarter, given the uncertainty, changing trends in our business, we thought it's prudent to take a more cautious stance and therefore, we're guiding up only slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis despite, as I mentioned in answering Vivek's question, despite having very strong backlog coverage, good bookings and better supply, which would all suggest higher growth. Operator : Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Ambrish Srivastava : I just had a question, Prashanth, on the floor that you have laid out for the gross margin, which is way above where margins bottomed out at in the prior real cycle and connection prices. And I'm asking this because I get this question a lot. Hey, what's the downside EPS projection for ADI? And so if you could please help us understand kind of what are the underlying assumptions behind that as it relates to utilization inventory. And then more importantly, what are you assuming for revenues to go down to hit that level? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure, sure. Thank you, Ambrish. So maybe let's start with a reminder that this company is structurally more profitable than we ever have been. The addition of Maxim gives us the benefit of scale, and we have the benefit of that hybrid manufacturing model, which really gives us that flexibility to manage our production utilizations by being able to notify our supply chain partners in the event we need to, with essentially a quarter's notice, to bring the outside supply number down and focus on keeping internal utilizations higher. As a result of that, we feel very confident that kind of through the downturn of a cycle, we can maintain that 70% gross margin floor, which from an investor model standpoint, is a unique metric that we put out there to give a floor. In thinking about a downturn scenario, and again, I want to emphasize, this is a projection to help investors model what it could be, not in any way a forecast of what we think is coming at us. But from a revenue standpoint, we have this great diversification, 75,000 products, 125,000 customers and thousands and thousands of applications, which are aligned to numerous secular growth markets. We have exposure to much stronger markets in a down cycle like aerospace and defense and health care, which are not going to be as cyclical. On the gross margin side, I mentioned this flexible manufacturing model that allows us to really help manage utilizations. And then we have a very accordion-driven variable compensation program, which allows us to moderate OpEx. So if we were to think about a downside scenario that was in a 15% down revenue market, we believe op margins would still have a 4 handle on them, probably be in the low 40s and gross margins would probably be, again, above 70, but probably in the low 70s. Operator : Our next question will come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : I wanted to delve a little bit more into the bookings and the order. So was it like bookings before were 150% and now they're 130%? Like where is that book-to-bill actually coming in? How far above one is it? And I guess what are you assuming happens to the backlog as we go into next quarter? Are you assuming that, that backlog gets drawn down at all or are you assuming it goes up? Or just what are the assumptions around that embedded in the guidance? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. So let's see what can we say here, Stacy. So for the last couple of quarters, excluding the third quarter, book-to-bill was -- actually, you can do the math because you can see how the backlog has increased so substantially. It between a one and a two, right? We're now still above one but we're at the lower end of that. Now industrial and automotive, strong, and that helped to compensate for -- I think I'm going from memory here, my consumer was just about flattish and comms was just a hair below. Stacy Rasgon : What are you assuming in the next quarter for the backlog? Michael Lucarelli : Yes, sure. I mean, the backlog is not that indicative of what happens for next quarter because it goes out into '23. So as you see these cancellations, this is a very small percent of the backlog and that's really into '23. So our assumption is backlog probably increases again because book-to-bill at an enterprise level is still above one. It's really not going to affect the demand for the fourth quarter or probably even the first quarter at this point. And as Prashanth said, I say investments bookings used to be way above one. Now they're nicely above one. So we're still booking above what we're shipping. So what would cause us not to come in kind of in line with supply, right? Why would we -- why would -- for the last couple of quarters, our revenue number has been purely a function of supply, and why could that not be the case for the fourth quarter? Why that could not be the case is if customers say, \"We'd like to reschedule the timing and we choose, in the spirit of customer satisfaction, not to push it to them although they've ordered it and give them that flexibility to move out.\" And it could be, as I mentioned, from the channel standpoint, if the channel looks like inventory in the channel is building at a level that we don't think is healthy for the business. And we choose to keep that inventory on our books to give us more flexibility to make sure that we can match customer demand better. Michael Lucarelli : I have one thing to that, that's important point Prashanth brought up on the channel is that 31 :50 assumes really no channel inventory build. That's a sell-through number that we're guiding to. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thank you, Mike. Michael Lucarelli : That's four different parts to that answer, Stacy, so we'll go to the next question. Operator : Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : I just want to follow up on a part question in terms of just where you're seeing these cancellations. You said consumer and comms are weaker. I think you just said comms book-to-bill is below one. But I'm just trying to understand in the comments of I think channel sell-through was weaker as well. Can you dial us in, is it isolated to certain segments? Or is all of these comments kind of broad-based in terms of where you're seeing the cancellations and the weaker sell-through? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Everything is broad-based, and we -- I think that if we have overemphasized cancellations on this call, that's probably a true statement right now, is I don't want to mislead folks to think that cancellations are a meaningful concern. But again, in the spirit of transparency, we're saying that they were up modestly. Michael Lucarelli - Head of IR : But everything we've talked about has been pretty broad-based. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And on comms, I just -- maybe just one follow-up is this has always been a lumpy business. We know that the wireless guys have spent a big chunk of money buying spectrum. That spectrum has to be deployed, which will require the 5G hardware that we have the market share leading position on. So we're highly confident. This is a pretty of timing issue. Operator : Our next question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead. Tore Svanberg : And congrats on another record. As we sort of move through this software environment, how are you thinking about the three big cost levers, utilization, OpEx and CapEx going forward? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Okay. So I think we've talked through some of that, Tore, but from at least certainly utilization levels, we're going to continue to see relatively good utilization levels across our internal factories for a few reasons : one is the benefit of the hybrid model is that we can bring more production in-house; second is that die bank levels are at very low levels, and we do need to get those die bank levels back to a healthy point. Die bank is an extremely cost-efficient place for us to hold inventory, particularly when you have 75,000 SKUs. You can hold it sort of think of it as $0.10 on the dollar. So it is very economically efficient and allows us to improve customer satisfaction later on. From an OpEx standpoint, as you've seen in the past, we have a very accordion-driven variable compensation program, which automatically unwinds if the financial performance of the company drives it to. And I think what's unique to ADI versus perhaps some of our peers is we have the cost synergies from Maxim, which are independent of the economic environment. From a CapEx standpoint, expect us to be -- it is business as usual. We had committed at the Investor Day to a higher level of CapEx in '22 and '23, which is necessary to add the supply needed to hit our long-term model of 7% to 10% growth, which we are very much committed to, and that is on track. Capital spend for the current quarter -- sorry, for the current year, maybe a bit below what we expected. That's a consequence of revenue coming in stronger, so bigger denominator and also just a little bit of delay in the receiving some of that equipment, but all of that will drive through in 2023. Vincent Roche : Yes. Sorry, Tore. On the OpEx side, we intend to -- we've been spending R&D at record levels. We intend to continue to ensure that we have properly funded all our critical programs. Innovation at a very, very important part of the value creation story of ADI. We are -- also we've been upping actually the spend in our go-to-market activities as well. So both of those, we will continue to keep our pedal to the metal on. Operator : Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : I wanted to ask a question on the supply side sort of the equation. Three months ago, you had talked about significant tightness, whether it be your internal supply or external foundry supply. I'm just curious if you're starting to see signs of supply easing. I guess test was a big bottleneck for internal supply 3, 6 months ago. Any changes there? And in terms of foundry wafer supply, again, any signs of easing? And kind of related to that, there have been some headlines about foundry wafer pricing increasing again in late '22 going into '23. Is that sort of the indication you're getting from your suppliers? And if so, are you comfortable that you'd be able to pass those through to your customers? Vincent Roche : Well, I think the last part of your question, first, on pricing increases, I believe that we are in the post-Moore's Law era and in a period of sustained structural inflation in this business for many, many years ahead. I think it's true to say that supply -- we've been increasing, of course. We've invested strongly in our own manufacturing capabilities to be able to secure supply and increase supply actually across the four wafer fabs inside ADI. So yes, supply is improving there. And thematically as well as supply has been improving actually right through the pandemic, right over the last couple of years from our subcontractors as well. So I think there is a lightening of supply across the board. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: On pricing, maybe I'll just restate what we said in the past. We are not using this environment to take advantage of our customers, and we are really looking to maintain our gross margin model. And the rationale on that gross margin model, which is important to us, is we know, as Vince mentioned, we spend at a healthy clip on R&D to develop highly innovative products, and we need to capture that innovation premium from our customers. So as our costs may increase, it's important that we continue to capture those cost increases back with stable margins because it's a reflection of the value we're bringing to our customers. Operator : Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Just one clarification. So I just wanted to verify, so you guys said that currently, quarter-to-date, your book-to-bill is still greater than one. That's my clarification question. Then my main question is distribution represents about 60% of the team's revenues, right? And it looks like just the inventories are still below your target levels of 7 to 8 weeks. Obviously, the eventual catch-up should provide you guys with some cushion if the environment continues to weaken further. But that being said, it still feels like auto and industrial demand is still quite strong. So given your outlook, like what's your view on getting to target levels on channel inventories over the next few quarters? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thanks, Harlan. Your -- first of all, say that you recapped it correctly, and there is some opportunity for us to continue to grow our revenue by bringing distis levels back to our healthy target level. But I want to emphasize that the guide, as Mike mentioned, the guide for the fourth quarter is on the basis of POS equals POA. One thing that ADI has been very consistent about for many years is we run our business on POS. So we need to look at end demand, and end demand drives how we end up manufacturing, and we want distis to be able to help us with access for those products, but we are not looking for distribution to be an excess buffer of inventory. Michael Lucarelli : And the one other part of the question that you had, Harlan, was book-to-bill. Yes, for the quarter, book-to-bill was still well above one at enterprise level. That was driven by industrial and auto with the two strongest markets, while comms and consumer, we'll call about flat, around one. And with that, may we have our last question, please? Operator : Our last question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore : Vince, a lot of questions about near-term cancellations, bookings, backlog, all those sorts of things. I wanted to ask a slightly longer one. You mentioned in answer to an earlier question about we're in a post-Moore's Law world. We're going to have an inflationary environment rather than deflationary. Can you just talk a little bit about how the customer conversations have changed? Over the last few months, we've heard a lot from last year, a lot from companies saying it's more of a partnership, longer lead times, et cetera, long-term supply agreements, those sorts of things. Do you still see that behavior continuing? Or do you believe that's a little bit more of a reflection of cyclical tightness and you expect some of that to unwind as well? Vincent Roche : Yes, it's a very good question. I've had a lot of conversations, Ross, over the last couple of years with CEOs of the biggest enterprises in the world of information. And what I can tell you for sure is that everybody wants to get closer to their key suppliers when it comes to aligning product roadmaps for the long term. Particularly companies that are perceived as being critical for their innovation processes. So I can tell you that continues. And the other side of the equation is everybody wants to understand at the customer side of things, what do they need to do to secure supply for the long term? And what kind of arrangements that they need to put in place? What kind of information flows? What kind of models that we develop between each other? So that continues. And I think it has been firmly established now that semiconductors are the bedrock of the modern -- of modern socioeconomic life. So the conversations continue intensively, I would say, and I expect that to continue well into the future. Michael Lucarelli : And with that, thanks, everyone, for joining our call this morning. I did want to flag that during these more uncertain times and consistent with our commitment to transparency for our owners, we'll be even more available. Vince and Prashanth will be in New York, L.A., the Bay Area, Chicago and across Europe in the next quarter, so it's a busy quarter coming up for us. Please reach out to myself or the IR team if you'd like to be notified when we're in your neighborhood. And with that, thanks for joining us and your continued interest in ADI.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.  I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call. Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On to disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and in our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law.  Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.  And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, I'm really extremely pleased to share that we delivered another record quarter, capping off what was a better year for ADI. Our fourth quarter revenue was $3.25 billion, and adjusted EPS was $2.73, and both at the high end of our outlook. For the fiscal year, revenue was $12 billion, up an impressive 26% year-over-year on a combined basis. Our Industrial, Automotive and Communications markets delivered all-time high revenues, and our Consumer business continued to grow despite industry-wide weakness. Adjusted EPS increased by nearly 50% to $9.57. We also delivered on our commitment to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in '22, returning $4.6 billion through share repurchases and dividends. These results not only exemplify the strength of our portfolio, but also our deep customer focus and the hard work of our employees to fortify ADI's brand.  To that end, in my recent conversations with customers, the message has been very clear. While we're not immune to supply disruptions, ADI\u2019s service, quality and support throughout this challenging time continues to be outstanding. Importantly, this sentiment is shared by customers of all sizes and across all markets. As a result, our customers are calling upon ADI to engage in longer term, more strategic collaborations to develop solutions that further empower the intelligent edge. So to ensure we remain at the forefront of technological advancements and customer service. We invested $1.7 billion in R&D and $700 million in CapEx in FY'22.  Now let me start with R&D. Our investments are targeted at strengthening our foundational high-performance Analog franchises as well as moving up the stack to create more complete solutions for our customers. A prime example is our Apollo platform, which we previewed at our Investor Day in April. Apollo is a flexible high-speed signal processing platform with unmatched levels of functionality, integration and performance, making it ubiquitous for all customers, but especially appealing to those in the broad market. During the quarter, we began sampling this innovative platform with our aerospace, communications and instrumentation customers and their feedback has been extremely positive. Turning now to the operations side. Over the last year, we invested a record amount of CapEx to increase our manufacturing output. And in 2023, we are, once again, investing aggressively in our U.S. and European factories to significantly expand our capacity. These investments will create a more flexible and cost-effective hybrid manufacturing model by increasing our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years. Our R&D and supply chain investments are essential to support our design win pipeline, which expanded by more than 10% in '22. This growth was led by our automotive energy systems and digital healthcare businesses. Notably, our growth in Automotive was underpinned by battery management systems, or BMS, which now has an opportunity pipeline nearing $4 billion. This year, eight new manufacturers designed in our BMS solutions, including two that plan to utilize our wireless platform. Our strong leadership position combined with increasing EV penetration globally, gives me great confidence in our future growth prospects.  Looking now at some selected design activity in the quarter. In industrial automation, we were designed into an advanced diagnostic system that monitors machine health at a global supplier for energy exploration. Our system solution approach enables an approximate 50% reduction in size and lowers wiring costs meaningfully. In aerospace and defense, we won RF module programs at multiple defense prime contractors. Our modules integrate hundreds of components to simplify the design process for our customers, while increasing our content from hundreds to thousands of dollars per system. In industrial instrumentation, we secured wins at two market leaders of next-generation high-voltage testers for electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. The combination of our high voltage processes and precision technology enables us to deliver accurate, reliable, and efficient testing required to scale the manufacturing of these systems.  And lastly, in Communications, we expanded our leadership in 5G radio systems with our transceiver portfolio winning additional share at key suppliers. These new wins position us even better as 5G networks roll out globally, especially in India, and ORAN begins to proliferate. Importantly, our design pipeline is beginning to benefit from cross-selling our ADI and Maxim portfolios. This puts us on a path to achieve our target $1 billion in revenue synergies. For example, at a European auto manufacturer, we built upon our strong audio connectivity position to cross-sell our high-speed GMSL technology, connecting their advanced driver systems. We're also capturing new opportunities with GMSL in the Industrial market. Last quarter, for example, our technology was designed into autonomous order fulfillment systems at one of the largest e-commerce companies. We're also making great inroads with our broader power portfolio, where our opportunity pipeline increased by double digits last year. Our increased breadth is helping us to better match customers' performance and power trade-offs across more applications, expanding our power SAM to nearly $10 billion. For example, at a leading European industrial customer, our position in mid-voltage power for distributed I/O control systems enabled us to pull through additional power content and precision signal chain sockets, thereby doubling our content per system.  Our expanding pipeline and significant revenue synergy opportunities instils greater diversity and resilience into our business, while adding new growth vectors. And taken together, I'm confident in our ability to bend the growth curve and move from our historical mid-single digit growth rate to our long-term model of 7% to 10%.  So in summary, while the macro crosscurrents are creating an abundance of uncertainty, ADI has successfully navigated many slowdowns over the course of our 57 year history. The strength of our franchise allows us to invest through business cycles, ensuring we continue to deliver breakthrough innovation, deepen our relevance to our customers and capture the emerging secular opportunities at the intelligent edge.  And so with that, I'll pass you over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We closed fiscal 2022 as our second consecutive year of record revenue and profits. We delivered sequential growth each quarter, achieving a new all-time high of $12 billion in revenue; gross margins of 73.6% increased 270 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and cost synergies; operating margin of 49.4% increased 700 basis points, reflecting strong execution on OpEx synergies\u2019 and adjusted EPS increased nearly 50% to $9.57. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.25 billion, finishing at the high end of our outlook. As I cover the performance by end market, both for the quarter and full year, my growth comments are on an adjusted combined basis where applicable. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market hit another all-time high and represented 51% of quarterly revenue. Growth was broad-based with each major application increasing sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, Industrial expanded 29% with growth in each business. Notably, digital healthcare was up over 30% and has now achieved seven straight record years. This consistent success in healthcare underscores the breadth of our ICs and subsystem solutions in a key secular growth market where such performance is critical. Automotive, which represented 21% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record year, growing both sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, Auto was up 31%, a favorable mix of premium vehicles, our growing BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power franchises, combined with enhanced value capture drove significant growth compared to SAAR. Together, these franchises of BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power represent over $1 billion of Automotive revenue. Communications, which represented 15% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record quarter with strong sequential growth in wireline, while our wireless business was about flat. For the year, Comms grew 27%. In wireless, our strong position in radio signal chains is enabling the 5G rollout globally. And in wireline, our optical and power portfolios benefited from the continued demand for bandwidth. Lastly, Consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue and was up modestly sequentially and flat year-over-year. Despite a challenging year for the broader industry, Consumer finished up 8%. This growth is a testament to how we have diversified our Consumer business and the innovation premium our products command. Today, approximately 30% of revenue is derived from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-gen conferencing systems, professional AV and home theater, while the remaining revenue in Consumer relates to the faster-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones. Now I'll move down the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 74%, up 310 basis points year-over-year driven by favorable product mix and synergy capture. OpEx was $744 million, down slightly sequentially due to the realization of additional synergies. And operating margin increased 800 basis points year-over-year, finishing at a record 51.1% as we exited the year with roughly $350 million of synergies realized across OpEx and cost of goods in our run rate. This incredible pace of synergy capture would not have been possible without the dedication of our integration office and the cross-functional teams that supported them.  Non-op expenses were $57 million, and the tax rate was 12.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at $2.73, up 58% year-over-year.  Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents and our net leverage ratio continues to remain below 1. Days of inventory increased to 140 while channel inventory was once again below our target range of 7 to 8 weeks.  Let me provide some additional details on our inventory. But first, during these uncertain times, we believe it is prudent to temporarily hold more finished goods on our balance sheet instead of shipping into the channel. This provides us with enhanced flexibility to better align supply with end customer demand across regions and markets. Second, raw material and WIP are increasing as we begin to rebuild our die bank. Over the last couple of years, our die bank was drastically reduced. And in some cases, sits 50% below optimal levels. Die bank inventory is highly cost efficient and it's critical for customer service as it can be used for different markets and customers. We believe higher inventory is crucial to reducing lead times as we look to return to our 4- to 8-week target service level over time. Given these actions, we expect inventory to increase in the near term before trending back down as we balance die bank rebuild with finished goods depletion. Moving to cash flow items. CapEx was $305 million for the quarter and $699 million for the year or 6% of revenue. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect elevated CapEx through 2023 at around high single digits as a percentage of revenue. For fiscal 2022, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. This is lower than normal given our higher capital intensity and onetime transaction and restructuring costs. These near-term headwinds were not unexpected when we outlined our long-term free cash flow target at our Investor Day and we remain committed to growing free cash flow to 40% of revenue. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to grow our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. And during the year, we returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. We repurchased $3.1 billion in shares, reducing share count by nearly 4%, while paying $1.5 billion of dividends.  So let me close with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As we noted last quarter, the uncertain and slowing macroeconomic environment has had some impact on demand. However, after a couple of months of slowing orders, we saw bookings stabilize during the quarter at what we'd consider relatively normal levels for entering our first quarter. Not surprisingly, bookings remain the strongest in the Industrial and Auto, while Communications and Consumer are weaker. We're guiding first quarter revenue to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million.  Given this environment, we thought it might be helpful to be a little more prescriptive in our outlook by market. So in the first quarter, we expect Auto to be up slightly sequentially; Industrial about flat; Comms to decline by mid-single digits; and Consumer to be down double digits sequentially. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high teens year-over-year and our B2B markets increasing over 20%. Op margins are expected to be 50% plus or minus 70 bps. Tax rate is expected to be between 12% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be $2.60 plus or minus $0.10.  So stepping back, we are well positioned in the near term, but the environment remains highly variable and dynamic. ADI like the rest of the industry is not immune to a softer macro environment; and thus, we remain cautious, yet optimistic. Longer term, we have over a year of backlog and continued momentum in our pipeline. We also have high flexibility with our hybrid manufacturing model and several OpEx levers in our toolkit to support our industry-leading margins and maintain robust cash returns to shareholders. So let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Now let's get to my fair part of the call, the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have any follow-up question, please queue and we'll take your question if time allows.  With that, can we have our first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you, and congratulations on another record quarter. Vince, a question for you. When you talked about the design wins, some of the design win activity, we continue to hear more and more of the system solutions. And I was just wondering if you could add a little bit more color on how your growth is being driven by higher ASPs? So I'm not suggesting higher pricing, right? I'm talking about higher ASPs because all of your products, obviously, moving up the value chain to more of a system solution type perspective. Vincent Roche : Yes. So thanks, Tore. Firstly, if you look at our ASPs compared to the Analog sector, we have a 3x multiple. And versus our closest competitor, we have a 5x multiple, and that diversion has been growing over the last several years. So, we decided quite a while ago that across the markets and the applications that we really cared about that what was really important for us to do was boil down the increasing complexity that our customers are dealing with in their product development systems and activities. And so essentially, what we've done is we've taken that complexity into ADI. We get to the other side of that complexity with the quality of our innovations and our ability to be able to couple many, many different facets of our portfolio together in areas like power management. We're building these 3D stacked module systems, sometimes with ASPs of hundreds of dollars.  If you look at our 5G radio systems, same thing. We combine microwave. We combine data conversion, power, digital algorithms and so on and so forth. So we have -- within the company, we believe in diversity of technologies, solutions customers and that choice of business model, Tore, at the end of the day and how we execute it gives us the richer ASPs when compared with our competitors. Michael Lucarelli : Go to next question please. Operator : The next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: Thank you for taking the question and happy early Thanksgiving. I guess I was hoping to probe a bit more around the cautious but optimistic view. You talked about orders stabilizing and a backlog that extends out 12 months. So I guess, first question, can you talk about what kind of scrubbing you've done on that backlog? And then secondly, based on that, how does that inform your outlook heading into fiscal '23? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : Let me take that and help give some color on the demand, order booking. So if you step back and think about last year, the first half of the year, we had orders at historical highs. And then last quarter in the earnings call, we called out that orders are beginning to slow, and that's a decline actually continued into the fourth quarter. However, we saw orders start to stabilize about midway through the fourth quarter and into the first couple of weeks here of the first quarter. So there was bookings our strongest in Industrial and Auto, not surprising and weaker in Comms and Consumer, which I reflected in the guide. From a geo standpoint, we'd say that not surprising. We're seeing weakness in Asia, especially China, but North America and Europe are holding up well. So given the combination of orders stabilizing and the backlog coverage that we have out, we feel pretty good about the near term. There is uncertainty out there, and things could change fast, but that\u2019s sort of what's driving our sort of cautious optimism. Vincent Roche : Yes. One other thing, C.J., to note. We've said before, the signal we watch most carefully in terms of really trying to understand demand is sell-through rather than sell-in. So that, I think, gives us a deeper degree of reality and the match between true demand and supply. Operator : The next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : I actually wanted to follow up on that question. Vince or Prashanth, are you surprised why your orders and bookings are holding up better, even though all the headlines we see from a macro perspective seem to be getting tougher? So what is helping you? And then specifically within your Industrial business, is it fair to think that factory automation is perhaps the most macro exposed part? And if yes, how should we think about that specific part of your most macro exposed segment within the Industrial business going into next year? Vincent Roche : Yes. So, well, let me start with the automation question. I've talked about a lot of the automation customers over the last while. And there continues to be, I would say, bullish expectation. I mean they're not immune from the macro. I think some of our customers are experiencing some soft cancellations in their business. But if you look at what's happening, we're going to see the life sciences transform. We're in the early stages of small batch processing in life sciences for manufacturing, for example. The energy sector is another area where, particularly the American, the U.S.-based automation customers, a lot of their businesses are -- they have a very large portion in the energy sector, oil and gas, for example, and that is likely to remain strong. So if that's a bedrock. I think that will remain strong for for several years to come.  We are seeing onshoring, reshoring. We're seeing movement of manufacturing, first time in India for the first time in a serious way. So my sense is, the industry won't outrun the macroeconomic conditions. But overall, I think the landing in terms of where demand will be softer than probably normal. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : Yes. Maybe, Vivek, just -- first, just to emphasize something that we said in the prepared remarks, all subsegments in Industrial grew in the fourth quarter, and we feel pretty good about where we are.  From a strength in Industrial versus the other markets, I'd look at it two ways. First, from a supply standpoint as we were seeing demand softening in other markets, we have the ability to use our hybrid model to get more wafers from our external partners, and we are biasing this additional supply into the industrial market, which has remained resilient and strong. At the same time, recall, we made a decision early in the supply disruption to make sure that we were taking care of our broad market and our smaller customers who tend to be more on the Industrial side. From a demand standpoint, the strength and resilience in the Industrial kind of speaks to where we play. We have extremely high share in those markets. And maybe to note versus our peers, some of our peers have cited weakness in -- I think they're calling it consumer industrial. We, on the other hand, put that business into our consumer. We call it the prosumer business, professional audio, video, et cetera. So when comparing us to peers, you'll see that our Industrial may be more pure Industrial. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think as well, for the last decade, 12, 13 years, we've been treating Industrial as the bedrock of the company. So it gets first call on R&D investments, customer engagements. And never have we been more diverse in terms of geographies, customer coverage, depth of coverage, depth of engagement. So -- and also, we have product life cycles that stretch into the decades with very, very stable pricing. So I think all those factors combine to make this an extremely strong business currently, and we're very, very bullish about the future here as well. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Buchalter with Cowen. Joshua Buchalter : Thanks for taking my question and let me echo Happy Thanksgiving. I wanted to ask about inventory levels and thank you in the prepared remarks for all the color there. I really understand the finished goods and die bank dynamics, along with the lean channel levels, but I was wondering at what range would we be at the point where you'd have to start taking proactive measures to lower inventories? I fully realize you haven't given an inventory target. But can you help us just directionally understand how you're thinking about that? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : So let me start with fourth quarter. Balance sheet days are up to about 140 and the channel is flattish, and it's still below our desired 7 to 8 target. So the growth in inventory that you're seeing in our balance sheet is coming from a couple of different drivers. Certainly, inflation for our cost of goods, sales growth, which requires us to have more coverage of inventory and then the strategic decisions we made in the prepared remarks. So I do just want to go through that one more time here. So we are temporarily going to hold more finished goods versus putting it into the channel. Because we believe that gives us the flexibility to align the supply with end customer demand across regions and markets. A bad outcome for us would be to give product to a particular distributor who doesn't have an end customer demand for that product, where someone else in a different market or geography is in need. Second, the die bank has really been dried out over the last couple of years. And I think I said, at some levels it's below 50% of where we want it. So die bank for us and for folks who may be less familiar with it, this is a product that has finished the front end, but before it goes to assembly and test. This allows us to get it through the back end in roughly four weeks. So it's quick turn, and it gives us maximum flexibility to put it across different markets. So investing in the die bank will help us get our service levels, which are critical for us given the focus we have on customer service, critical for us to get those levels back up. So the result is, expect higher days in the first half, and then it will trend back down as finished goods burn out and the die bank comes to where we would like it to be. So our goal for the inventory is to get our lead times down to our old target, which was roughly 90% of our goods can be shipped within 4 to 8 weeks. And given the long life of our products, we always carry a pretty minimal risk of obsolescence. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. And Josh, one thing to add, you asked about utilization when we think about taking them down. One thing I wanted to point out is about our swing capacity and cross-qualification. So before we pulled down our internal utilization, we'll bring what we can back in from external, internal to support utilizations and our gross margins. Operator : The next question today comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital. Ambrish Srivastava : I'm going to ask the same question. I think we're all struggling with it. You guys won a lot of accolades for being super transparent last earnings call talking about the order trends. I think Vivek asked the right question, were you surprised? Is there a seasonality to it? I mean nobody doubts your positioning and how strong you are in your chosen markets. And Prashanth, thanks for clarifying the prosumer versus other companies calling it legacy industrial. But is there a seasonal aspect to it as well that orders stabilize because it's very contrary to what we\u2019re seeing, hearing from other companies report, including many industrial companies? Because last time, you had said that you expected -- although order cancellations were very small, you expected them to climb in the current quarter. So I would love to get a little bit more color on that. And then a real quick tactical one on lead times. Where are the lead times now? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : Sure. Yes. Let me just make a comment on cancellation. So we provided cancellations as a metric that we watch in the third quarter because we wanted to give everyone some context that we saw an inflection happening with orders. So it was in the spirit of transparency. However, I don't want to get into a pattern of reporting cancellation data every quarter. So if it was something meaningful, we would have called it out, which we didn't. So you can read that for what it is.  I would say that unlike others in the industry, we are proactively analyzing our backlog and working with customers to remove orders that they no longer want given the rapidly changing environment. So this strategy for us is to seek out cancellation. It helps us align our backlog with current demand, and it really gives us better visibility into where the supply needs and what we need to build. So that has increased our confidence in the quality of the backlog we have. It is still -- the coverage is out still over a year, but it is down sequentially. And so while we're always mindful that there can be some continued noise in that backlog, we feel pretty good about both the guide and as we mentioned, the near term. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think the diversities, well, Ambrish, of the business in general is stronger than it's ever been. We're getting benefit. We're winning share in the power management market, that sector of our portfolio. And I think if you look at where we are in the Automotive sector, where we're getting a very strong tailwind from the electrification of the vehicle. In fact, we're gaining a lot of share in general, I think, within in-cabin and the electric vehicle. So I think we've got some tailwinds that are transcending the macro cycle here as well.  The only part of the business I would say that has a cyclical timber to it now is the Consumer area, where we have seen kind of the normal pattern there at the -- which happens at the tail end of the year. Michael Lucarelli : And the question on lead times Ambrish. The lead times actually in the quarter, they have come down. I would say they're still extremely high and much higher than we want them to get. And Prashanth talked about how he wants to -- how he -- or we want to increase our inventory to bring down those lead times, but we have some products that are on time and some products that are lead time to 52 weeks. So lead times have come down overall sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, and that's reflected in kind of our outlook, our backlog, cancellations, everything that we gave you. Operator : The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon : I had a quick housekeeping question and then a broader one. The housekeeping question, you had an extra week in Q1 '18. So Q1 '23 would be five years later. Is there an extra week in the guide at all? And on the broader question, you talked about some of the OpEx levers that you have. I think last quarter, you talked about like in a 15% revenue down year, you could keep gross margins above 70. I guess the question is do you still believe that? And what would OpEx do in a scenario like that? What are some of the levers you would pull? Michael Lucarelli : Stacy, I'll do the housekeeping. No, I guess our outlook is very, very strong, given you thought it would be a 14-week quarter, it's not. Our first quarter in '23 is a 13-week quarter. Our next 14-week quarter will be in 2024. So to repeat the outlook for 1Q is a 13-week quarter. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : Okay. And I think your question really is on the downturn scenario analysis. I'll just -- I'll restate that, Stacy. We've covered that a few times, but we put our gross margin floor out there at 70%, and we did that because we have confidence that we have the levers, given the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model and the resiliency of our business that it's unlikely that we're going to pass through that. So we\u2019ve tested that at a down 15%. And what we've shared with folks in the past is that a down 15% is quite comfortable that we can stay north of that 70% and the OpEx levers for us would be the -- about 80% of our OpEx is fixed or less variable in nature, which leaves us about 20% on the levers that we can work with to ensure that we keep operating margins north of 40%. I will say that for 2023, our commitment is -- and as Vince often says, we run this company for the long term. So we are committed to continuing to invest throughout the course of '23. We'll, obviously, be mindful of the environment. And if we see a change that warrants us to take action, you can count on us to take action but we -- at least for the next quarter, to expect us to continue to make the right decisions for the long-term health of the business. Stacy Rasgon : It sounds like OpEx ticks up a little bit into Q1 as well, just based on what you just said? Michael Lucarelli : You read it well, Stacy. Operator : The next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities. William Stein : I'm hoping to hit on the inventory question yet again. You've done a very straightforward, good job of explaining to us what's going on in your own inventory. And it sounds like distribution is still below your target even though on their balance sheets across all their suppliers, it looks like they're elevated. But we've seen other parts of the supply chain, in particular, the manufacturing services companies, which I imagine are a big percentage of sort of your counterparty sales on transactions. And I'm wondering to what degree you've scrubbed that half channel, half customer, however you want to look at it, for inventory that could hurt demand going forward? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : Thanks, Will. Great question. Let me -- I'll -- let me do the easy part of that, and that is, sell-in is essentially equal to sell-through. So from a channel standpoint, we're well aligned and our channel partners are not building inventory. I made the comment that we're holding some finished goods on our own balance sheet. From a customer standpoint, I think Vince has had a lot of conversations with customers. So I'm going to pass to him to talk about what he's hearing from them. Vincent Roche : Yes. I don't think our customers are in the mode of building safety stocks. There are mismatches, I think. There's the well-described golden screw problem. It's probably a base in compared to where it was six months ago, but I don't think customers -- there's no major inventory building going on right now. And I think our customers are doing their best to match their orders and the product supply to be able to create finished goods. So they're not there yet. I think there is still some unserved demand that customers are trying to fulfill. So -- but we're working very closely with our customers. As we've said, we take our signals from sell-through, and we're working with our customers diligently across all 125,000 of them, big and small, to make sure that we get the best match between what they need and what we're able to deliver.  And what I'm hearing in general is that, yes, we haven't serviced all the demands that all the customers have needed. But in general, we've been very transparent. Our customers are very pleased with our customer service. And I think it positions us very, very well coming out of the supply crunch to be able to deepen our engagements with our customers and -- both on the R&D side as well as the supply chain side. And customers are increasingly interested to partner with companies like ADI on both of those dimensions, and we're ready. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : And we're seeing in the pipeline -- we're seeing it in the pipeline growth. Michael Lucarelli : And we go to our last question, please? Operator : The last question today comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I had one quick housekeeping question and then another broader question. In terms of the housekeeping question, I was curious what did pricing do in fiscal year '22 on a pro forma basis? I think the business grew, what is it, around 25% pro forma. How much of that was pricing? And as you think about fiscal '23 or calendar '23, is the expectation for foundry costs to increase in the out-year as well?  And then my broader question is probably for Vince. As you think about the full year '23, based on your backlog, based on your design wins and customer conversations, which end markets or applications are you most excited about in terms of contribution to growth? I realize you run a diverse business, and that's the beauty of ADI. But if you were to single out a couple, where your expectations are the highest, which ones would they be? And which end markets or applications would you be most worried about? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah : Sure. Thanks, Toshiya. Let me take the first one quickly. So for '22, growth was fairly balanced and about half of that is coming from ASPs. But I do want to emphasize something that we've said over the course of all of '22, we passed cost through to customers. We did not use that environment to raise our gross margins. That was how we did the calculation of how much price to pass on to a customer was based on the input costs that were relevant to those customers. So with that, I'll let Vince take the more interesting part. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Prashant. So yes, I think in terms of '23, the markets that have been performing very, very well for the company over the last couple of years, particularly Automotive, which we've already talked about; the electrification of the vehicle, we're very, very well positioned there. And we're winning a lot of share in the in-cabin electronics as well, the new display systems, which are very, very complex. The dashboard displays need a lot of very, very clever power electronics. So we're well positioned.  From an Industrial perspective as well, digital healthcare has been growing at the company in double digits for over the last 7 years or thereabouts. We expect to see that continue. Also, aerospace and defense, that's likely to be a very brisk business. It's performing well for ADI now, and I believe, at least for the next 5 years, we will see stellar growth in that area. And energy, our energy and sustainability businesses are also beginning to really go on the uptick.  So where am I concerned? I'm not really concerned about the business in general, given the diversity that we have, diversity of customers, products, applications. 5G, perhaps, we'll see what is likely to be weakness in Europe, offset by growth in India, growth in ORAN, steadiness in the U.S., and that kind of summarizes how we think about things. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Prashanth and I will be at CES this year hosting meetings. We also have a booth on the showroom floor where we have technology demos across auto, healthcare and consumer. We hope to see you there. And with that, have a great Thanksgiving, and thanks for joining the call. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019d like to now introduce your host for today\u2019s call. Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Gigi, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI\u2019s CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On to disclosures. Information we\u2019re about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and in our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s release. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Well, I\u2019m very pleased to share that ADI continued to execute exceptionally well in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Revenue was $3.25 billion, up 21% year-over-year, strength was broad based with all B2B markets, up single-digits. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 51% respectively and adjusted EPS achieved another record at $2.75. Our continued success is driven by a relentless focus on customer collaboration, a growing demand for our innovative technologies and strong operational execution. We play a long game and are excited about what the future holds for us to ensure that we capture the opportunity ahead. We\u2019ve been steadily increasing investments in R&D, manufacturing capabilities and in partnerships that deepen our value to our customers now and over the long-term. For example, in R&D, we\u2019ve invested $1.7 billion over the trailing 12 months to strengthen our core franchises and capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers. Over the same period, we\u2019ve invested $760 million in CapEx to enhance the resiliency of our internal semiconductor manufacturing operations. These investments not only increase our operational resiliency, but also modernize our fabs to better address our sustainability ambitions. As mentioned in our press release, our industrial and automotive businesses remain strong as we gain market share. So this morning, I want to focus specifically on our industrial business, which continues to grow significantly despite the macroeconomic backdrop. Now, from a big picture perspective, the industrial market is the bedrock of ADI, representing more than half of our total revenue. It\u2019s also our most diverse and profitable business segment with tens of thousands of customers and products that sustain revenue streams for decades. Additionally, ADI\u2019s industrial revenue is derived from high performance technology in mission-critical CapEx-intensive equipment across the myriad applications. Our leadership position has been strengthened over the last decade as we intensified our focus in this market and invested over $5 billion in R&D activities to capture the opportunity across the hundreds of applications that characterize the industrial sector. This space is inherently fragmented and the unmatched breadth and depth of ADI\u2019s portfolio uniquely allows us to address our customer\u2019s needs across the full spectrum of applications. With core component building blocks to application-specific solutions that encompass analog, digital and algorithms. Today, we\u2019re seeing the rise of new industrial applications that require more sophisticated and more complex architectures as machines become more intelligent and more sustainable. This is driving more semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx, unlocking new opportunities for our portfolio. While this transformation is benefiting all of our industrial applications, including healthcare and aerospace, let me share how we\u2019re winning an industrial automation and instrumentation more specifically and discuss the burgeoning opportunity across the electrification ecosystem. So, starting first with industrial automation. Here, our customers are upgrading their factories with more automation and connectivity to increase output with greater energy efficiency. ADI\u2019s broad portfolio helps customers create these more resilient and flexible footprints while lowering their carbon emissions on the journey to net-zero. As an example, at a leading U.S. robotics manufacturer, we\u2019ve won additional content across power sensing and GMSL connectivity. Our systems approach reduced our customers\u2019 design time and increased our content per cobot by 4x. Also in the last quarter, our IO-Link solution was designed in at multiple leading industrial automation customers. These solutions are critical for delivering robust connectivity to the edge of the factory floor. Turning our attention now to our instrumentation and test business. This subsector is highly aligned to secular growth trends from connectivity to AI-assisted compute to electrification to drug discovery and gene therapies. The consistent thread across this diverse set of applications is the growing complexity that requires more advanced metrology and test. The results, our average content per system is now 2x to 3x higher. Further, the localization of semiconductor supply is providing additional tailwinds for our test business. We\u2019ve secured multiple design wins in North America as well as Asia for memory and high-performance compute. And finally, on to one of our fastest-growing areas, the electrification ecosystem. The collective need for a more sustainable future is driving massive growth in electrical grid infrastructure. Now let me share two examples with you. First, industrial and automotive companies have announced more than $300 billion of investments in greenfield gigafactories, essential to the production of batteries to proliferate the electrification ecosystem. These gigafactories will drive additional demand for our formation and test solutions critical to producing higher density batteries. Further, given the inherent safety hazards of using higher cell voltages, these factories will also provide new growth vectors for ADI. In our sustainable energy franchise, we\u2019re leveraging our industry-leading automotive BMS solutions into energy storage systems for electrical grids and fast-charging infrastructure. We\u2019ve won designs at leading EV infrastructure manufacturers in North America, Europe and Asia, putting us on a path to more than tripling this business in the coming years. Of course, while no market is fully immune to adverse economic cycles, our industrial business is highly diversified and aligned with secular trends. This has translated to more durable revenue streams with sales in this sector increasing more than 25% over the trailing 12 months despite a weakening economic backdrop. But looking ahead, we see continued strength in this franchise as the breadth and depth of our portfolio, our deep customer collaborations and design win pipeline momentum underpin our new phase of profitable growth. So in closing, ADI\u2019s business model is diverse, resilient and rich with opportunity. I\u2019m very optimistic about what our future holds as we drive enhanced value for our customers employees and shareholders as well as society at large. And so with that, I\u2019ll hand you over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today\u2019s press release. First quarter revenue of $3.25 billion finished at the high end of our outlook, driven by continued share gains in industrial and automotive. Our B2B markets represented 89% of revenue, up 25% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially despite our first quarter typically being down. Now let\u2019s look at performance by end markets. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market represented 52% of revenue and hit another all-time high. This business has grown sequentially for 12 consecutive quarters. All markets increased year-over-year, led by automation, sustainable energy, instrumentation and test. Automotive, which represented 22% of revenue, also achieved another record, increasing 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. All applications grew double digits year-over-year as our market leading positions across battery management and in-cabin connectivity continue to deliver significant growth. Communications, which represented 15% of revenue, grew 18% year-over-year. As expected, comms declined slightly sequentially as strength in wired was offset by softness in wireless due to the timing of 5G deployments. And lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, was down 5% year-over-year and declined 14% sequentially given weaker market trends and seasonality. Now onto the rest of the P&L. Gross margin of 73.6% expanded 170 basis points year-over-year, unfavorable mix and cost synergies. OpEx was $733 million down slightly sequentially as we balance strategic hiring with the tight discretionary spend and synergy capture. Given our strong operating leverage combined with the synergy savings, our operating margin was 51.1%. Importantly, we have already captured nearly all of the $400 million cost synergy goals. As such, our communication will now turn to the revenue synergy opportunities from our combined portfolio and our complimentary customer base with Maxim. Recall that Anelise, our Chief Customer Officer, unveiled how we are strategically approaching these synergies during our Investor Day, and Vince has routinely highlighted some of these compelling opportunities over the past few quarters. To that end, we are closely monitoring and measuring progress from opportunity to design win to new revenue. And while it is still early, design win momentum to date has exceeded our expectations. This gives us increased confidence in achieving our $1 billion plus revenue synergy opportunity that we outlined at our Investor Day. Non-op expenses were $60 million, and the tax rate was just over 12%. All told, EPS came in at $2.75, up 42% year-over-year and hitting a new record. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio below 1. Days of inventory increase to 155, while channel inventory remains below our target level. Recall that last quarter, we outlined our strategy to rebuild strategic die bank and hold more finished goods inventory on our balance sheet as we moderate shipment into the channel during this time of inflection. Moving on to cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $176 million and $764 million over the trailing 12 months, representing 6% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx to be high-single-digits as a percentage of sales in 2023 and then decline in subsequent years to our long-term target of mid-single-digit. These investments will double our internal revenue output exiting next year and support strategic swing capacity between our fabs and our foundry partners. The flexibility of our hybrid model across different geographies enhances our resiliency and offers our customers additional optionality. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $4.3 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Over this period, we have returned $4.7 billion to shareholders or over 100% of free cash flow via $3.1 billion of buybacks and dividends of $1.6 billion. We just raised our quarterly dividend by 13%, marking our fifth consecutive double digit increase, and 19 consecutive years of increases. This is a testament to our durable operating model that has generated positive free cash flow for 26 consecutive years. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. The dividend is the cornerstone of this policy, and we look to increase our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with remaining cash used for share count reduction. Now, similar to prior quarters, I\u2019d like to give a brief update on the operating backdrop. First, on markets. Industrial orders, as Vince highlighted, remain the strongest followed by automotive, while comms and consumer remain weak. Given the rapidly changing environment, we are diligently working with our customers to remove orders that they may no longer require. At the same time, we have increased our supply by growing our internal output and working with our foundry partners. These actions have reduced our lead times with half of our portfolio now shipping in under 13 weeks. Despite this, backlog coverage remains around one year of revenue. As such, we expect our book-to-bill will remain below parody over the next couple quarters as our backlog returns to more normal levels. Given these dynamics, we are guiding second quarter revenue to be $3.2 billion plus or minus $100 million. We expect continued sequential growth in our industrial and automotive markets and another sequential decline in our communications and consumer markets. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high-single-digits year-over-year with our B2B markets up over 10% once again. Operating margin is expected to be 51% plus or minus 70 basis points. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 11% to 13% for the year. This guide reflects the new U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&D expenses for tax purposes, resulting in higher upfront cash tax payments, but lowers our effective tax rate temporarily due to the deferred tax accounting requirements. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.75, plus or minus $0.10. In all, the macro backdrop remains uncertain. However, we remain cautiously optimistic on the near-term, given the resilient strength across our industrial and auto businesses, which represent over 75% of our revenue. Longer-term, we remain well positioned to drive growth enabled by our diverse high performance portfolio aligned with the key secular trends at the Intelligent Edge. Let me now pass it back to Mike for our Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. Let\u2019s go to the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants in the call this morning. If you have follow-up question, please requeue. I\u2019ll take your question if time allows. With that our first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess the \u2013 my question really would center around the industrial strength that you\u2019re seeing. You talked in great detail around kind of emerging new markets as well as increasing content yet, I think a lot of investors are focused on kind of declining PMIs around the globe. And so we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on why your business is, acting so very different from, maybe some of the larger macro trends. And perhaps more color on how much of it is content? How much of it is maybe emerging growth areas that are not reflected in some of these PMIs would be very helpful? Thanks so much. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, C.J. So, I think first and foremost, our success isn\u2019t by dent of chance. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in this market for more than a decade, and it\u2019s really our focus. It\u2019s our core, it\u2019s the core of ADI and from both an R&D and customer engagement perspective, we\u2019ve been really doubling down here over this decade plus kind of time span. And we\u2019ve been gaining market share for sure. We have \u2013 compared to even kind of three years, four years ago, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve always had a very strong position in the signal chain, the kind of data path processing electronics, but we\u2019ve been able to, with the acquisitions of LTC and Maxim, we\u2019ve been able to bring very strong competitive power portfolio to bear as well. So, I think from a portfolio perspective, we\u2019re in much better shape. I pointed out in the script as well that when we talk about industrial, it\u2019s truly the industrial sector. I know many competitors talk about other kind of indescribable sectors or businesses that are not well understood, like consumer, for example, other consumers. So, I want to point that out as well. We have, as I said, many secular growth drivers in play. We see the average content per dollar of CapEx spend increased at a pretty meaningful level across all the applications, including instrumentation, factory automation is changing also. It\u2019s bringing more sensing, more compute to the edge and all of that is driving content gain for ADI. So, I think they are the primary drivers of the business. And yes, PMIs are, I would say, in the kind of retraction zone right now, but we see stabilization. And I think when China comes back as well, which is likely to happen, we believe, over the coming months, that will drive things even further into a positive zone. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: C.J., this is Prashanth. I\u2019ll just put one more thing just to help folks understand kind of the breadth of that growth. All of our submarkets were up double digits year-over-year, and most of them increased quarter-over-quarter. And if you look at it by geography, we had strength in America, Europe and Japan, again, all up double digits year-over-year, offsetting a weaker China. So this industrial strength was very broad-based. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, C.J. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a pair of kind of related question, which is how long can book-to-bill remain on before it starts to become, [indiscernible]? And usually, if I look historically for ADI, generally, the second half tends to be better than the first half. What would support that view or prevent that from happening this year? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Okay. Yes. So Vivek, let me maybe take a walk through cancellations, backlog lead times to help answer that. But I do want to clarify, you said on book-to-bill. Our book-to-bill is sub one. I thought I heard you say it was one. Our book-to-bill is sub one. We told you that was happening a couple of months ago, and I\u2019d expect to carry for another quarter or two as we get through this backlog. So on the backlog, we\u2019ve been saying for a while now that we\u2019ve got record backlog, and we are working with our customers and our disti partners to get this rationalized with what customers need today versus perhaps the orders they had placed on us six months or nine months ago when we had very long lead time. This progress is what is being reflected in that book-to-bill ratio below one. I think that it will probably be below parity for another quarter or two as we get back to normal backlog. Lead times, the supply-demand imbalance is definitely getting better, slowly, but it\u2019s getting better. We\u2019re getting more wafers externally, thanks to the hybrid model. We have the flexibility to do that as well as the investments we\u2019re making internally as we\u2019ve talked about with our CapEx deployment to increase production. So, we have about 50% of the portfolio under 13 weeks today, meaning it can ship within the quarter, and that\u2019s going to continue to improve over the \u2013 through the second half. So takeaway sort of given lead times falling, bookings getting higher quality compared to year ago as customers aren\u2019t ordering for stuff way into the future. And at the place backlog, and we feel this is positive for visibility, and we\u2019re really getting to true demand. Vivek Arya : And anything on second half, Prashanth, because it looks more like a soft take of then a soft landing from the trends? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So, I don\u2019t want to go out too far, but I\u2019ll just give you a couple of comments here. And if Vince wants to make any long-term comment. We feel good about the outlook for the second quarter given the resiliency in auto and industrial. As I said, 75% of our sales come from those two segments, and we still have a year for the backlog. Beyond the second quarter, it\u2019s hard on the one hand to make a call, given that we have strong backlog coverage, but we also understand there\u2019s a lot of macro uncertainty out there and things are changing fast. So, I\u2019m not going to make any predictions one area to pay attention to, and Vince made a comment on this, is China. I think we and many companies are watching China. If demand accelerates in the second half given sort of the optimism on consumers and government that would be \u2013 that would be good for a number of organizations. Vince, anything more longer term, you want to add on that? Vincent Roche : Well, I think, Prashant, we\u2019ve clearly built a lot of resiliency into the way we run the company into the business model as well as the manufacturing operations. So, who knows what the second half is going to bring. But what I can tell you is that \u2013 we\u2019ve been through many, many cycles before and never have we been better positioned in our history than we are now from a portfolio, from a customer engagement standpoint. So \u2013 this industry is likely \u2013 it\u2019s taken us kind of 20 years to double from kind of 2000 to 2020, we\u2019ve probably doubled the content that the industry builds over the next 10 years. And I believe ADI is very, very well positioned given the strength, as I said, of our portfolio, our customer engagements, and this hybrid manufacturing model that we\u2019ve got in place to enable us to capture the upside and manage the downside. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Vivek. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you and congratulations on the results. So on Maxim now that we\u2019re sort of moving from the cost synergies to the revenue synergies, are there any particular areas that we should keep an eye on there, whether end markets or product categories where you expect to see that $1 billion in synergies? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, let me \u2013 let\u2019s do that in two parts. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of context so that everyone remembers what we talked about and then hand over to Vince. So we\u2019ve closed on the cost synergies. We feel great about that. So we\u2019re focusing now on revenue synergies, and we\u2019re tracking ahead of schedule. We think about that synergy in stages. So first we need to identify the socket, we need to win the socket, we begin shipping to the customer, and then we hit volume. So we are tracking all of those stages through our internal material. As I said, Anelise gave you a target in April to come \u2013 to deliver $1 billion of incremental. Vince is holding her to a higher bar than that. So she\u2019s on track to hit that $1 billion. And we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve seen early success. I think you\u2019ve heard Vince share a couple examples over the last couple quarters. For example, in the \u2013 our ability to cross sell A to B as well as put GMSL into non-auto customers which is new. So let me pass off to Vince here for what are some of the other areas that we\u2019re thinking about? Vincent Roche : Yes. When we announced the combination, Tore, with Maxim, we pointed out two particular market areas where we thought ADI was underweight, where power in particular, power management was really important, power in data center, for example. And as the compute density skyrocket, and in fact in the compute area, performance and power are pretty much one and the same thing. So we have now a very competitive power portfolio that we can bring to more application specific areas such as data center as well as automotive. The \u2013 I think a very positive surprise is that the connectivity portfolio based on GMSL, the multi gig serial link is that not only are we gaining more and more traction in automotive, but also we\u2019re bringing it to other areas such as industrial, as Prashanth mentioned. BMS, we\u2019ve got 16 of the top 20 wired BMS OEMs sockets in the top 20 OEMs. And Maxim strengthens that portfolio as well. So in industrial, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the I/O link technology is very, very, that Maxim brings to bear is very, very complementary with ADI\u2019s data path solutions. So I think there are multiple areas and I think the message I want to convey here is that I was always optimistic about what we could do with a greater channel, more cross connectivity to the ADI portfolio. But I\u2019m more enthusiastic than ever based on what I\u2019m actually observing now with the various markets and customers in which we\u2019re playing. Tore Svanberg : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi. Chris Danely : Hey, thanks guys. Just a little more clarification on the lead times and the shortages. So you mentioned that half of the portfolio has lead times of less than 13 weeks right now. Can you talk about what that was three months ago? And then when would you expect the lead times to, I guess, \u201clargely normalized\u201d and with a couple flat quarters? And it seems like you got plenty of inventory. Why aren\u2019t these lead times normalizing a little bit faster? Thanks. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. Chris let me \u2013 Michael have to remind me where we were three months ago. But the \u2013 so the supply demand balance is getting better. And we\u2019re getting that \u2013 we\u2019re getting more wafers, so \u2013 in addition to our internal production. The way to think about the lead times is we\u2019ve got half the portfolio shipping within the quarter. And certainly in the next quarter or two, we will have the overwhelming majority of that down to within one quarter. The inventory build as I mentioned, is in part due to our desire to kind of keep more inventory on ADI\u2019s books because we are clearly in a period of great uncertainty and we\u2019re being very mindful of putting too much to our channel partners when there\u2019s this much uncertainty out there. So that will \u2013 as lead times improve, our channel partners can count on us to get what they need in quick terms, and then we\u2019ll be able to more reliably think about what\u2019s the right stocking level for the channel. Michael Lucarelli : Okay. And Chris to your question, where was it beginning the quarter. If you look at that metrics under 13 weeks, beginning of the quarter was probably about 25% of the portfolio. So we doubled that number and Prashanth laid out, we want to get it close to a 100% exiting this year. And I know Vince is pushing hard to get even sooner than that. I think the biggest takeaway at lead times is the short lead times, the more high quality the bookings are. I think that\u2019s what we want to see is the true underlying of what demand is as those lead times continue to come in and why does it take so long while demand is strong, right? Demand is strong, it\u2019s harder to reduce lead times in a strong demand environment. Chris Danely : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe it\u2019s a dumb question. But I\u2019m having a little bit of trouble squaring the majority of the portfolio getting to be within 13 weekly times together with a year\u2019s worth of backlog. How do I square those two things? It feels like the backlog should be shorter if the lead times are actually like getting back to normal. Maybe the other way to ask it is when the majority of the portfolio has 13-week lead times, where do you expect that backlog to be? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, so Stacy, I think perhaps the missing elements of your \u2013 of how you\u2019re thinking about it is the assumption that that backlog is delinquent. It is not. The \u2013 when the lead times get extended, customers put the orders on us, but they also tell us when they want that product delivered. So there\u2019s a visibility curve to that backlog. It is not that it is all past due and needs to be shipped against. Stacy Rasgon : Oh, I see. Okay. So you\u2019re \u2013 okay, so you\u2019ve got orders out. We know that we\u2019re going to be shipping this to you in six months and they placed it [ph]. So I guess where do you expect that backlog to be standing given what you see for demand once, say we\u2019re in a quarter to pass this and the majority of the portfolio is shipping within a quarter. Where do you expect the backlogs to be? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Well, let\u2019s go back to the \u2013 if we get to \u2013 if we return to what was normal for us pre COVID, let\u2019s say that\u2019s the best perspective we can give you. If we return to what does normal look like then at the start of a 13-week quarter, we would have about 10 weeks of that quarter in backlog. And then there would still be some incremental backlog out there for future quarters, but it would be meaningfully smaller because customers know that they can put that order on us in essentially less than a quarter\u2019s notice. So that\u2019s what normal looks like. Now, given the supply, demand challenges and the increasing importance of Analog\u2019s products to our customers, we may benefit from some greater visibility in the future, but I don\u2019t want to call that today. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. So I guess, does this mean, are you effectively over shipping demand right now because the backlog is pulling it? Or is that not the right way to think about it? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: No, I would \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how you would conclude that. We are \u2013 we have the \u2013 we have demand from our customers in that backlog that tells us. I want this product in Q1, I want this product in Q2, this product in Q3, and that is what we are matching up for. But it gives us a visibility that we have historically not had at this level. That is why they are not as incentive to put new orders on us, is because they\u2019ve given us those orders, hence book to bill below one. Vincent Roche : Yes. One other thing we\u2019re pointing out, Stacy, is that we run \u2013 our demand signals are sell through. We run our factories on the basis of POS demand rather than sell in or POA demand. So it gives us more integrity around the demand signal. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I won\u2019t monopolize anymore. Thank you so much, guys. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks Stacy, for that three part question. You use your question for next quarter, so we\u2019re not going to \u2013 have the call next quarter. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi, thank you. I\u2019m going to keep it to one. Mike, I don\u2019t want to get any of bad site. Vince, I actually wanted to focus on a bit on the long-term here. I was called out a much higher growth rate for analog and for themselves as a result. And I was wondering if you share the same view, I know you guys have had a 7% to 10%, and Vince you have always all the conversations over the years, you always felt that the analog industry going forward should grow faster than the 5.6 odd that we\u2019ve seen over the long-term. So I was just wondering how you think about analog growth and you called out a bunch of secular drivers that, four or five years ago didn\u2019t even exist for the analog industry and broadly for semis. Thank you, Vince. Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks, Ambrish. Well, I think, as I pointed out in the prepared remarks, we are seeing more, for example, in the industrial space, more content per dollar of CapEx invested by our customers. And that trend has been in play for several years now. That coupled with ADI\u2019s portfolio strength, the breadth we have the, as I mentioned, the data path, which has been ADI core, ADI traditional strength, adding LTC and Maxim Power portfolios. That gives us the opportunity to tap into more of the TAM, so to speak. Half of the analog market, TAM is kind of data path. The other half is power. So we\u2019ve now got the, the highest performance portfolio in the industry, the greatest breadth and depth. And, when you see what\u2019s happening there with healthcare, our digital healthcare business, which is getting on for, kind of a $1 billion over the next year, year and a half aerospace and defense, coupled with automation and instrumentation that we\u2019ve talked about in the prepared remarks. We\u2019re very, very bullish about our ability to drive growth in the market. The other thing I want to point out is that we focus on driving our revenue growth through high quality innovation for which we get paid. We get three times the ASPs of the analog market at large, and we get more than that, compared to our biggest competitor. So I want to make the point that we focus on shipping value versus volume. So I think with the sector growth drivers, the way we\u2019ve structured our business model, our focus on high performance and being able to capture more value with all the things we talked about over the course of the call here, I\u2019m focused on what we can do as a company and I believe we\u2019re better positioned than ever. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Ambrish, Prashanth, maybe just a just two things to add. First our long-term growth model is built on all of our segments. So industrial certainly is an important, very, very important part of it. But we look for all of our operating segments to be able to contribute to that. We\u2019ve had two consecutive record years with greater than 20% growth. And with the numbers that we\u2019ve shared today, we\u2019re off to a strong start for 2023. Our 7% to 10% CAGR outlook, which we revealed, unveiled last April, already reflected a faster growth versus sort of the historical mid-single digit rate. And as we said in the prepared remarks, as well as in addressing, I think it was Tore\u2019s question we have a, we have meaningful delta with the revenue synergies from Maxim, which is really idiosyncratic to the ADI story. Vincent Roche : Yes, I just want to add one final comment to this, just want to add one final comment Ambrish, to this part of the conversation, I\u2019ve had innumerable conversations with CEOs across the globe over the last three years in particular, it\u2019s certainly intensified with the crunch on supply. But I got two consistent questions from them. Irrespective of what sector they\u2019re in, how can we get closer to ADI\u2019s longer term technology roadmap, and also how do we bond together more tightly when it comes to understanding supply chain and collaborating more together across those two dimensions. So that\u2019s the sentiment and I think given the way we\u2019ve conducted ourselves over the last the last three years we\u2019ve, we\u2019re better positioned. Our brand is has been augmented and strengthened over the last several years. So yes, I think we\u2019ve got a lot of strong logic as to why the market will strengthen and why ADI will be better positioned than ever to capture the opportunity. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Ambrish. Ambrish Srivastava : Thank you. I\u2019ll jump back in queue. I don\u2019t want to get on mics. Michael Lucarelli : Not a bad side. Vincent Roche : Last question? Michael Lucarelli : Last question please. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. There\u2019s second half uncertainty as you mentioned, probably more so in your comms and consumer businesses, maybe a little bit in industrial due to the soft PMIs as was mentioned earlier. But global auto demand trends, especially EVs remains pretty resilient, right? And you guys have a strong design wind portfolio and automotive that is starting to unfold. I know last earnings call, last month at CES, the team remained pretty confident on growing your automotive business this year by double-digit percentage on a flattish, sort of SARs. So, if you look at some of the third party research, I mean, SARs is forecasted to grow 2% to 3% this year. So is the team still confident on driving strong double-digit percentage growth profile this fiscal year on auto? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Harlan. Yes. So if we look at our outperformance versus SAR, it comes down to a couple items. First, as you mentioned, there\u2019s a mix of premium cars, so higher content per vehicle and EV growth is accelerating. And our content is 3x as high on an EV versus a traditional ICE car. We\u2019ve spoken at length that we\u2019ve got real key content adders, our BMS product, our GMSL and our A2B are adopted and they\u2019re really taking meaningful market share across all of our customer base there. And I think because of the performance that we bring to our customers, we\u2019re able to capture value better than perhaps some others. So with those three working, we\u2019re, we still feel pretty good that that we\u2019re going to continue to have a, 2x to 3x multiplier on SAR. So I don\u2019t want to make a prediction as to what SAR is. So you\u2019ve got a, I think IHS has a mid-single digit number, a lower mid-single digit number out there. But we\u2019re for the year, I expect us to kind of be 2x to 3x wherever that lands. Harlan Sur : Perfect. Insightful. Thank you, Prashanth. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you Harlan, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Two quick ones before I let you guys go. Our next earnings call will be held a week later than normal, as Vince was asked to give a keynote at IMAX Technology World Forum. So do not panic when we see your announcement. The earning is not two and a half weeks after closed, but three and a half weeks. Second, we\u2019re planning to restart our ADI on coverage series where we do a deep dive into a market in the coming months. The first one will be on some of the topics we hit on today, automation, energy efficiency, sustainability, electrification. So stay tuned for those. And with that, thanks again for joining us and interest in Analog Devices. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal '23 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial statements and schedules at investor.analog.com. On to the disclosures, the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and other periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our commentary will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. We're comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, I'm very pleased to share that ADI continued to execute well in the second quarter. We delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth and record earnings per share. Notably, revenue was $3.26 billion, growing 10% year-over-year. And once again, this was driven by record results in our industrial and automotive sectors. Gross margin was nearly 74% and operating margin surpassed 51%, reflecting the innovation premium our portfolio commands and our strong financial discipline and EPS increased an impressive 18% year-over-year. Now I'd like to spend a moment on the current business conditions. We previously shared that our business was at an inflection point due to uncertain economic and the geopolitical backdrop. After three years of steady growth, customers are beginning to adjust their forecasts and rebalance their inventories. This is most pronounced in Asia, while North-America and Europe demand is moderating, but at a more measured pace. We expect this normalization of revenue will persist through the second half of 2023. Importantly, given our customer conversations and proactive decisions to improve lead times and right-size our backlog, we're in a position to deliver on our goal of delivering a soft lending. Stepping back, we've successfully navigated macro challenges many, many times before. Today, ADI has an even more durable franchise, defined by an unmatched diversity of products, customers and applications. A hybrid manufacturing model that better adapts to demand fluctuations, and of course, a fortified balance sheet. These characteristics instill a resiliency, that helps ADIs mitigate market weakness, and invest through economic cycles in critical areas that will define our future. Notably, unlike previous economic cycles, we have numerous concurrent secular growth drivers across all of our markets that drive more semi-content per dollar of CapEx. And we have exposure to sectors that will transcend the macro uncertainty, including areas like digital healthcare, aerospace, defense and the electrification ecosystem. So to that end, I want to highlight our digital healthcare business, which resides in our industrial end market. Healthcare is a market that is ripe for renovation and it's one that requires the highest levels of performance. Now currently, the United States leads the world in healthcare spending with more than $4 trillion spent in 2022 alone, approaching 20% of GDP. This amount has steadily increased over several decades, and unfortunately does not correlates to world\u2019s leading health outcomes. Both the U.S. along with most international healthcare systems are still reliant on serving the majority of patients with critical or chronic conditions in large, centralized, acute-care hospitals, where specialized expertise and equipment resides. The pandemic highlighted the fragility of the system, underscoring the urgent need for remote physician consultation and distributed clinical grade patient care. This vision of a decentralized system to improve the accessibility, affordability and efficacy of global healthcare can only be realized through the proliferation of edge-based diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. ADI saw this promising opportunity early and made digital healthcare a strategic focus area over a decade ago. Over that time our R&D investments have expanded our portfolio from core signal processing, sensing and power technologies to more highly integrated application specific products to now full system level solutions. The result, our healthcare franchise has delivered seven straight record revenue years, generating $900 million annually and we're on track to achieve a new high watermark in '23 despite the macro backdrop. Importantly ADI has become an industry leader in three primary areas. The first is medical imaging, where our highly integrated products performed critical functions. This includes enhancing image quality, minimizing radiation dosage, improving system assembly, and simplifying field maintenance. Today, we've strong share positions in areas like CT scanners, digital X-ray and ultrasound. Next is automation and instrumentation. For example, our broad portfolio enables us to create the optimized signal chains required in applications such as infusion pumps, ventilators and defibrillators. Third is personal health monitoring. Here, our highest performance products are used throughout the operating room and the ICU, while more compact versions with lower power are designed into wearable devices performing both clinical and consumer wellness monitoring functions. Now let me share some of the examples of how we're seeing ADI's solutions shape the future of healthcare. The ultrasound industry is migrating from large cart based equipment to more compact mobile systems. Recently, ADI won the design as a market leader for their compact ultrasound system. Our solution leverages our complete portfolio including high speed signal chain and high voltage power technologies, to deliver the highest quality images at the lowest power in a smaller footprint. We're also developing an echo to bits technology to untether the ultrasound modality from the hospital and enable hospital grade care in even the most remote locations. Our solution uses proprietary ultra-low power analog technology that performs both the data acquisition and beamforming functions at extremely low power levels with embedded software algorithms. This allows the user to get cart based performance in a handheld form, without compromising image quality, resolution, or functionality. Now turning for a moment to robotic surgery. Currently, only about 15% of the world's surgical procedures use robotic technology despite the many benefits. These include greater precision, flexibility, and control during surgery and shorter hospital stays, fewer complications, and lower levels of pain for patients. We already designed in, at the largest robotic surgical suppliers with our suite of precision motor control, signal processing, power management and sensing solutions. And with content per system in the thousands of dollars and performance demands increasing exponentially, this application is poised to deliver significant growth in the years ahead. In the area of personal health monitoring, clinical grade vital signs monitors are converging with consumer wellness wearables. Now this is an emerging market for our comprehensive suite of technologies, including our sensor AFEs, microcontrollers and ultra-low power technologies, which has been strengthened by the integration of Maxim. For example, in diabetes management, ADI has long been a leading supplier of blood glucose monitoring technology. Now we're working with key customers in the next-generation of continuous glucose monitoring. Our solution increases the level of robustness, accuracy and power efficiency of the glucose sensor, thereby extending its life from days to weeks. And there is much, much more to come. We are extending our reach into innovative medical products that connect our hardware with cloud-based connectivity analytics and service. I'm delighted to share with you that our first non-invasive chronic disease management device is undergoing marketing clearance with the FDA and I look-forward to sharing more as this new market has the potential to significantly expand our healthcare segment (ph). So big picture, we're shaping the digital revolution in healthcare. ADI's ability to go from component to system supplier underscores our deep domain expertise and unrelenting focus on innovation. Setting us apart from the pack, not only in healthcare, but in all of our markets. So while there is near-term uncertainty, we are excited about the long-term opportunities that lie ahead. The center of gravity for data processing is shifting from the cloud to the edge. And ADI where data is born is at the center of this evolution, enabling the next waves of innovation for our customers. Now before I hand over to Prashanth, I want to address our announcement that he will be leaving ADI at the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize, Prashanth for his many contributions and for his partnership over these past six years. He has played an important role during a period of extraordinary growth and value creation for ADI, including help build a robust finance function and fostering strong investor community engagement. Please know that Prashanth will be remaining in his full capacity and continuing to engage with all of you while we identify our next CFO through a search process that is now underway. And with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. It has been an honor to serve as the CFO of this phenomenal company and lead this world-class finance organization. As Vince mentioned, I'm fully committed to ensuring a smooth transition and I look forward to engaging with all of you during the coming quarters. I do want to express my deep appreciation to Vince, both as a coach and a mentor, but also for introducing me to this magical world of semiconductors. As my boss often says, we truly are the bedrock upon which the global technology industry is built. Now turning to our second quarter results. As usual, my comments today with the exception of revenue will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release. We delivered another very strong quarter, record revenue of $3.26 billion exceeded the midpoint of guidance and represented ADI's 13th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, we grew 10%, led once again by all-time highs in industrial and automotive. Breaking it down by market, industrial, our most diverse and profitable business represented 53% of revenue and finished up 3% sequentially. Year-over-year growth of 16% was broad-based, notable gains in sustainable energy, aerospace and defense. These markets in addition to healthcare, which Vince just highlighted are much better positioned to withstand cyclical slowdown and together they represent roughly 40% of industrial revenue. Automotive, which represented 24% of revenue, once again exhibited broad based strength, growing 10% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Secular tailwinds fueling content growth continue to drive ADI's leading battery management and in-cabin connectivity solutions, which combined increased nearly 40% year-over-year. Communications, which represented 14% of revenue, decreased both sequentially and year-over-year, due to the ongoing inventory corrections across this end market. And lastly, consumer at 9% of revenue was down more than 20% sequentially and year-over-year, after several quarters of softness, consumer revenue is close to its COVID low, suggesting that the correction is nearly complete. Moving on to the P&L. Gross margin of 73.7% was up slightly sequentially due to favorable product mix. OpEx at $733 million was in line with last quarter and op margins of 51.2%, up roughly 100 basis points year-over-year set a new record. Non-OP expenses were $48 million and our tax rate was 11.4%. Remember that Q2 is typically our lowest rate. All told, EPS came in at $2.83, up an impressive 18% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. We've discussed many times our decision to hold more finished goods inventory versus restocking the channel. Thus, our days of inventory increased to 168, and channel inventory weeks were basically unchanged. As we outlined a quarter ago, we expect inventory dollars will decline in the second half as we balance the replenishment of die bank and moderate external purchases. Moving to cash flow. CapEx was $284 million in the quarter and $930 million over the trailing 12 months, representing 7% of revenue. As a reminder, we outlined at our Investor Day that we expect CapEx to be high-single digits as a percentage of sales in 2023 and then declined in subsequent years to our longer-term target of mid-single digits. These investments will support our long-term growth plans and enable strategic swing capacity between our fabs and our foundry partners. The flexibility of our hybrid model across different geographies, enhances our resiliency. It offers our customers additional optionality and it provides an important financial shock absorber during times of volatility. Of note, our CapEx spend to-date does not include the benefits of both the U.S. and the European tax credits and grant funds that we anticipate from both the U.S. and European CHIPS Acts. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $4 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. We've returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, $3.5 billion in buybacks and $1.6 billion via dividends. We remain committed to our shareholder friendly policy of returning 100% free cash flow over the long term. Now before moving to the outlook, I do want to provide some additional details on the evolving business conditions. As Vince shared in his remarks, customers are adjusting forecasts and rebalancing inventory. At the same time, our lead times continue to improve with over 70% of our portfolio now shipping in under 13 weeks. This gives customers high confidence into the timeliness of our supply. The result book-to-bill as we outlined last quarter remains below parity in all markets and our backlog due in the current quarter has returned to its typical coverage range. As a result, total backlog continues to decline, but just under a year of revenue, it's still 2x regular levels. And lastly, after a strong start to the second quarter, demand quickly deteriorated in Asia, impacting channel sell-through. As a result, we plan to reduce channel inventory in this region. And in the third quarter, we are planning for sell-in to be below sell-through for the total company. Given these dynamics, we are guiding third quarter revenue to be $3.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect industrial and auto to be down low to mid-single digit sequentially, communications down around 10% sequentially, while consumer will increase sequentially. Op margin is expected to be 48.5% plus or minus 70 bps. The decline in op margin relates to our annual merit increases, changing product mix and a reduction of manufacturing utilizations given the softer environment. Our tax rate again between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.52 plus or minus $0.10. While the near-term operating environment is a difficult one, our diversification and exposure to key secular trends is expected to help mitigate the revenue impact. In addition, we have key levers to help us minimize margin volatility. This include our flexible hybrid manufacturing model, which allows us to quickly reduce spend on external wafers and moderate the impact on internal utilizations. Our variable compensation program, which has a true accordion like function, allowing us to reduce spend, while still investing in key long-term areas. As a result, we expect a durable earnings stream, and solid free cash flow generation, enabling us to take advantage of any share price dislocations. Before handing off to Mike, I want to remind folks that in June, we will be doing a deep dive on the burgeoning opportunity for ADI in the construction of gigafactories. And with that, let me pass it to Mike for Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. I want to echo Vince's comments and thank you for the partnership over the past six years, but I will warn you, it's not done yet, we\u2019ve couple of more earnings calls together. So with that, let's get to the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question please requeue and we'll take your question if time allows. With that, can we have our first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for the question and thanks and best wishes to Prashanth. So my question really is, I'm trying to understand where is the incremental weakness, is that limited to Asia and within Asia is that industrial or automotive or both? And what about non-Asia demand, how has that changed versus what you had thought three months ago? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Vivek. It's been a pleasure to work with you, Vin, (ph) we still have a few quarters together. Everyone is focused on quarter-over-quarter, but I -- before I get to your answer, I do want to take a step back and look at the year-over-year because I do think that tells the story of share gains and the increasing content per dollar of CapEx, which is what we believe delivers that long-term shareholder value. If you look at our industrial and auto business, they are up year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance. Industrial call it roughly mid-single digit and auto mid-teens year-over-year. And this comes at a time when PMIs are below 50 and auto SAR is relatively modest. So while the economics and the cycle dictate the number of units our customer sell, which will impact our business, our share gains and our increasing content per dollar of CapEx is what we expect to help us outperform, which means we're going to decline less in bad times and accelerate good -- accelerate in good times. To your specific question, China definitely was, sort of the piece of new information that has developed over the year, over the more recent period. We are -- we have had three quarters of decline in China and we're expecting a fourth. We did see an uptick following kind of the resumption or the return to office after Chinese New Year, but that did fade quickly, and the result was we've got inventory a little higher in the channel there than we expected. Very confident that this is not a share issue. This is a reflection of what's going on in those markets. And it's broad-based across both the industrial and auto. Outside of China, I'd say that industrial and auto is holding up relatively well, especially North America, Europe and Japan. Not as strong as it was prior quarter, but it's not falling rapidly. And I would characterize it more as a measured slowdown. Comms and consumer, we've been talking about those in all those geographies, those remain weak. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. Prashanth, it's been great working with you. Wish you all the best. I know we're together for a few more months, but anyway wish you all the best. My question is on utilization and inventory levels. So could you give us a sense for where utilization is today, what's your plan for the second half, you did talk about inventory in dollar terms coming down in the second half, but if you could give us any color on the extent of that would really appreciate it. Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Tore. It's been great working with you. So, as we think about inventory, inventory is going to remain higher than normal because we're keeping the channel lean. This is something we started two or three quarters ago. From a dollar basis, inventory has peaked in second quarter as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and you should see dollar start to trend down from here, given the actions that we're taking, which is both reducing our external wafer builds, which is an opportunity that we have because of our swing capacity in our hybrid manufacturing model, and that also allows us to balance out the die bank building in our internal factories with softer demand and tap the brakes on internal (ph) utilizations. Utilizations, I would say, still are at elevated levels, so we expect them to start getting closer to what we would consider normal levels in the -- in our fiscal fourth quarter. Vincent Roche : Tore, to give you a little context, in the outlook we gave, it\u2019s about (ph) 48.5% operating margins that assumes gross margins come down from where they are today. That's mix and also it is utilizations, Prashanth mentioned. And then, OpEx was up a little bit in the third quarter based on merit increase offset some by the variable compensation. So that's kind of the math around that. And then as you said, as you look out, utilizations probably don't go higher in 4Q after 3Q. Just kind of give you a feel for the back half of the year. Tore Svanberg : Great. Thank you. Vincent Roche : Thanks for the question. We'll go to next one. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Vincent Roche : Hi, Ambrish. We hear you. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi, sorry. Sorry, I lost you for a sec. Thanks. Thank you, Prashanth, pleasure working with you as well. I just wanted to come back to the backlog. And you just went through this comment a little bit too quick for me. So the backlog as you said, 2x regular levels, but book-to-bill below and it is where the typical coverage ranges at this point. So I was really unsure what that means. More importantly book-to-bill should then be trending lower, as we go over the next couple of quarters, is that the right conclusion I should take away from those comments? Vincent Roche : What I would -- I guess, let me, let's do this in two pieces. First, let's talk about our view on this correction. Obviously no correction is the same. But if you look over at history, Ambrish, most of these sort of downturns last for somewhere between two to four quarters, and it's our view that, that we're going to have weakness for the second half. But a couple of points around that. First, we are really seeing this as a rolling correction across the market, because obviously no market is fully immune, but I do think that we're better-positioned. Comms and consumer, I think we -- you would agree with us, the worst is largely behind us with. We've seen those correct over the last couple of quarters and we're actually being a little bit more optimistic about consumer as we go forward. Industrial and auto, we're starting to see some softness, but that's probably not going to just last a quarter. It's important to point out that we do have some areas of strength in industrial. We mentioned that in the prepared remarks. And auto really is going to continue to be a function of the of the SAR activity. From a bookings and backlog standpoint, the takeaways you want is, bookings overall continue to decrease, but they're basically sitting at about a year of revenue, the total backlog. What that means is that the backlog for the current quarter is now to normal levels, which means that we're back to a point where we will be relying on some book and ship to hit the guide and that's back to normal pre-COVID levels, and on a book-to-bill were below parity, which we had said for a couple quarters now that this was coming and that's pretty broad-based to sort of all markets, industrial and auto are a little bit better, but all markets, all geographies, I did call out on -- in I think Tore's question that China is certainly the weakest of that. Ambrish Srivastava : Got it. Thank you. I'll queue back for another follow-up. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Ambrish. We'll go to next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Great. Hi. Let me add my congratulations to Prashanth. Can you talk about the backlog being out over a year, when 70% of lead times are below 13 weeks. How much -- I know you've been pretty aggressive scrubbing that backlog. How confident are you that, that reflects real demand? And then, can you sort of describe, it seems like you're still getting a pretty decent amount of bookings, considering that people have booked out 52 weeks and can get product within 13. Can you just -- are people still placing orders beyond lead time to try to assure continuity? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah. Great question, Joe. Thank you. So first, yes, you're exactly right. When we talk about backlog being kind of roughly a year in value, that's phased over several quarters. So we have delivery dates from customers that are in future quarters, which sort of gives us confidence to what the future looks like. And now, we're sort of back to that stage that we've always operated in pre-COVID levels where there is a percentage of the current quarter's revenues that comes from turns business. So we're back to that state of normalcy, with the lead times down as they've improved with our manufacturing capacity additions. Now, there's no incentive for customers to keep giving us orders out with a significant advanced notice, they can get most of what they need pretty quickly. And that's the transition that you're seeing being reflected in the book-to-bill rate. But again, as I mentioned, we are expecting. And Vince has talked for a couple quarters now that, that we were expecting the macro impact to hit us, but we remain very confident that the content story we have is going to help mute the impact relative to others and given our end market exposure, as I mentioned, it's sort of going to be rolling through us. Consumer and comms are largely behind us, we will see auto pressure on units for a couple of quarters -- sorry, industrial pressure on units for a couple of quarters. And auto, we can't give you a good sense of, except to say we know we have a phenomenal content story growth there and it really will depend on consumer purchases. Vincent Roche : Yeah. I think, Joe, at the margins, I think our customers have changed their behavior. It used to be that the world expect to be able to operate on a very rapid turns cycle. Now I think that, that will persist, but what will also persist is the change in behavior around aligning long -- customers allowing their long-term or longer-term demands with supply. And those are conversations that we're having continuously. So I think the behavior has changed somewhat, and perhaps we've got a new normal. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Joe. We'll go to next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Chris Danely : Thanks, guys. I'll add my congrats to Prashanth. I wish I was retiring too. I just had a, I guess a question or some more color on the correction. What do you think triggered it? Do you think it was just a function of the shortages going away and people always had a little bit inventory out there. And now they can -- they can start to cancel orders and then how bad do you think it could get. I mean your auto businesses tripled and your industrial business has doubled in the last two years unchanged. So what should we think it for like the October quarter and beyond? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah. Chris, I don't know that I would call it a trigger per se. I think that -- as I mentioned, we've been sort of rolling through this. It is just that there has been enough growth in some parts of our market that have overshadowed the pressure we've seen on comms and consumer. Now industrial, which is really the flagship is starting to feel a little bit of the impact from the higher interest rate environment. So that's coming through. But again I would call out that we've got a pretty sizable portion of that industrial market that is very recession resistant, that's the healthcare business, which Vince talked about the aerospace and defense, as well as our energy business. I think what I mentioned I think to Ambrish's question is, the piece that perhaps with most surprising to us is, we were expecting a stronger bounce in China, as they reopened from COVID and they got on the other side of Chinese New Year, and that recovery has not happened. And again, as I mentioned, we know that it's not a share issue. It is macro issue to that market. And what was the -- what was the second part of your question? Chris Danely : Just how bad do you think it could get? Any color on October and beyond? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I'm going to -- I'm going to turn to the 40-year veteran of this business, who has seen multiple cycles and let Vince take that. Vincent Roche : Yeah, Chris. I think first and foremost, what we're seeing now in our business is that the troughs are not as deep and the peaks are steeper than they used to be. There is more and more content in every one of the market segments that we participate in. So I think that's the way to look at the troughs are probably going to be -- they're probably going to be shallower. And also we've been very careful at managing our factories and making sure that we don't unnecessarily build inventory and ship product that perhaps isn't needed. So my sense is, we set ourselves for a softer landing just given how we've managed through the cycle and try to match demand of our customers as tightly as we can with the supply system. So, I think perhaps just given where PMIs are at, we would see at least a couple of quarters here of muted demand. And my sense is, when the central (ph) begins to turn, it will turn quickly. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah, Chris. I\u2019ll add a little bit about -- unit demand for the couple of quarters here. It's good to think like, we've grown 13 quarters of relatively. I think investors and sell-side people forget that you do have down quarter sometimes. And we're kind of going back to, what I'll call a bit more normal and a more normal 4Q, you kind of -- you see industrial kind of flat to down from 3Q, orders about flat. Comms not much activity happening right now in that market and consumer usually up a little bit. And if you look at our 1Q, a normal 1Q for us, the B2B markets, which is industrial, auto, and comms are down, kind of low mid-single digits and consumer is down a bit more due to holiday builds. And then you get a 2Q pickup. Now that's not an outlook. That's kind of what the normal shape was pre-COVID. Vincent Roche : Yeah. I can tell you as well, Chris, from conversations with our industrial and automotive customers, their sentiment is quite strong. I met the CEO of one of the largest industrial automation companies, very, very recently. And they see tremendous secular growth drivers. There is a rebound in demand from the pandemic stage, where a lot of factory, the CapEx to improve factories, efficiencies and so on was not spent, so that continues. The whole sustainability challenge is on everybody's mind. So there are many reasons to believe that we're going through a short-term period here of reconciliation, normalization of demand and supply, but my sense is, things will recover in the industrial market pretty rapidly. And in automotive, it's a case of, we're getting more and more share in the areas that count with our connectivity products, the electric vehicle portfolio that we've got. And there still reasonable demand, I would say, for mid to high end automobiles. So, we see this as a relatively short-term reset. Chris Danely : Thanks, guys. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Just want to echo the congrats for Prashanth. A quick clarification then a question. The clarification is when you talk about the second half being a little bit weaker is that fiscal year or calendar year? And then the two question is on the automotive side of things. You've mentioned a couple of times that it's kind of SAR dependent, but the bigger trend in automotive over the last few years has been mainly content. And you guys have benefited from that as well. I think you're one of the first companies in the semi side to guide that down, albeit minimally on a sequential basis. Has something changed there, that you're seeing that others aren't, is it inventory, is it demand, just anymore color on that would be helpful? Vincent Roche : Yeah, Mike. You want to take that? Michael Lucarelli : Yeah. I'll go the first part, Ross, I gave a little bit of comments around kind of what I thought would be for our fiscal 4Q and fiscal 1Q outlook based on kind of normalization. So you can kind of take from that and parse that with your question about is it fiscal second half or calendar second half and put it along that, it's both. With that, I'll pass it to on the auto side. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I'll take it. All right. Yeah. So look, we've grown 10 quarters in a row and the growth was -- for the last quarter was very broad-based, again across all applications. As we think about the outlook, we are beginning to see some softening though the underlying content growth continue and our top line should still prove to be a strong multiple of SAR. There is some decline that relates to our strong position in China EV. So when you asked about what's different for ADI, Ross, I think that the share position we have in China EV is probably one of those differentiating factors. And that is going through an adjustment as well. While China EVs are still expected to grow, it's not going to be growing as fast as we had originally thought. And so, as this market comes back, it's going to provide the tailwinds we need for our automotive businesses because we have very high share. Again take a step back, we remain very confident that this is a business with the strong product portfolio we have, battery management, in-cabin connectivity with GMSL, A2B, and functional safe power. These represent about half of our business and in a flat SAR environment, we are still going to be able to do double-digit growth. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Ross. And Liz, we go to our last question, please. Operator : This question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. William Stein : Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I can squeeze them in. First, I wonder you've been very optimistic or relatively optimistic about pricing in the past few discussions we've had, essentially highlighting that foundries are either still raising or certainly not lowering and you're having no problems passing that on. I'd like you to comment if there is any update in that regard. And then the other is just to try to get maybe linger a moment and get a better understanding for what happened in China, because earlier in the quarter, I think you've met with us and some other investors and discussed how business there was recovering. What -- how can you explain how quickly this seems to have changed from improving in China to suddenly getting even worse? Thank you very much. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah. Thanks, Will. I'm going to do the China one first, so Vince can address the pricing one. The China one is pretty straightforward. We -- as most of the industry, we were watching the recovery coming out of the multi-quarter shutdown in China as well as the Chinese New Year activity looking to see business begin to return to normal levels, given that we had couple of down quarters. We saw a pop-in activity and order activity in the -- as we came out of Chinese New Year. Based on that, we made supply available to the channel that supply did not move as things kind of quickly got softer or didn't move as much I can say, didn't move as much. And therefore, that's why we've now said, for the current quarter, we are going to ship in less than we sell-through to help readjust that level in primarily in Asia. And with that, I'll hand-off to Vince to take the pricing question. Vincent Roche : Yeah. Thanks, Prashanth. Yeah. Well, I think that the headline of pricing, is that it is very, very resilient. And I expect that to persist. In general, we're getting -- we're putting more value to our customers, we're giving more value to our customers. And in fact the core ASP of our product portfolio has been increasing, not including incidentally inflationary cost that we pass to our customers. So, I think one thing we can say for sure about our franchise is. Our products are very, very sticky, our products persist for many, many decades for example in the industrial sector. And we're in the post Moore's Law era, where the economic conditions have changed fundamentally. So I expect the pricing arena to be very steady across the industry. And in general in the years ahead and we will look for opportunities to pass on inflation, which is going to be persistent in the industry, I believe, in the coming quarters. William Stein : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Will. I thank everyone for joining us this morning. A couple of items before I'll let you go on your way. First, we are playing combined, our general ledger (ph) ERP systems this quarter. This represents one of our final steps for the Maxim integration. Given our typically fast reporting cycle, we've given ourselves an extra week to ensure everything runs smoothly. As such, we plan for our earnings call to be held in the third-week of August versus the second. Also, I wanted to flag that during these more uncertain times and consistent with our commitment for transparency for our owners, we plan being even more available for investors. Vince and Prashanth will be in New York, Boston, The Bay Area and London in the next quarter. Please reach out to the IR team if you be notified when we are in your neighborhood. And with that, a cognitive transcript will be available on the website. Thanks again for joining us and your continued interest in Analog Devices. Have a good day.

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal '23 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release, and other periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information, as these statements reflect our expectations only at the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. We are comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. ADI executed well in the third quarter and delivered results within our expectations despite the challenging operating environment. Revenue was nearly $3.1 billion, led by growth in our Industrial and Automotive markets once again. Gross margin remained strong, above 72%, operating margin was nearly 48% and EPS was $249 million. This continued profitability reflects our portfolio's resilience as well as the innovation premium that it commands. I want to turn to the current business environment now just for a moment. As we shared last quarter, we believe we're in a period of customer inventory reconciliation following three consecutive years of steady growth. Through our customer conversations, it's evident these accelerating inventory adjustments relate to the weakening macro backdrop and ADI's rapidly improving lead times. Importantly, we believe we shipped below end market consumption in the third quarter and expect to do so again in the fourth. This will help normalize our customers' inventory more quickly and position us to return to growth more quickly in the coming quarters. Stepping back, while near-term dynamics or turbulence, our long-term confidence remains undiminished. Over the last several decades, we have enhanced the resiliency of our global business, defined by our diversified customer and product portfolio and flexible hybrid manufacturing model. This enables us to ensure softer demand periods while sustaining strategic investments to ensure that we capitalize on the upside when the business inflects. It's these characteristics and our alignment to numerous concurrent secular growth trends that give us confidence that ADI will deliver on our long-term model of 7% to 10% revenue CAGR. Now one area underpinning this growth outlook are the applications tied to sustainable use cases, which currently represents about 1/3 of our total revenue. And today, I want to unpack a vital part of this, the evolving electrification ecosystem that is driving growth in our industrial and automotive markets. As the world marches to net 0, we need to eliminate 51 gigatons of global greenhouse gases emitted every year. Fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor accounting for more than 75% of all emissions. And at the same time, global energy consumption is forecasted to increase by 50% by 2050. A major unnecessary energy transition is underway and an upgraded and expanded energy grid is foundational to support a decarbonization pathway. Making the shift through renewable energy sources in both commercial and residential infrastructure as well as electric vehicles and global transportation will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These moves also create new challenges in the generation distribution, consumption and smoothing of energy supply. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of this electrification journey from upgrading the grid infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. The common thread woven through all these applications is the high-performance precision signal processing, control and power management capabilities they require, capabilities in which ADI excels. Now today, I'll bring the story to life at the application level, starting with grid infrastructure. Overall, today's electrical grid is undergoing modernization to meet current and future demands. Historically, traditional energy sources like coal, oil and gas were centralized and distributed in one direction from the grid to the consumer. Today, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are more distributed necessitating a dynamic bidirectional flow of energy. To achieve this, the grid must be able to adjust performance across the network in real time, which requires an exponential increase in monitoring and storage capabilities. And for example, our collaboration with the Enel Group provides smart meters and grid digitalization solutions for distribution system operators. Here, ADI's control and sensing technologies are enabling high-performance, precision monitoring and data creation at the heart of the digital substation. And we're leveraging our mixed-signal digital and algorithm technologies to enable greater intelligence at the grid's edge. Now moving to energy storage systems, which are critical to mitigate intermittency issues across the network. ADI is a leader with our technologies used in 60% of energy storage systems across residential, commercial and grid scale networks. Leveraging our battery management system technology or BMS. We're increasing capacity and improving energy utilization in energy storage systems, which maximizes the battery's lifetime value. These monitoring and storage challenges extend to the grid's edge as well, including EV charging stations, ADI's energy metrology, isolation and sensing technologies, help enable a broader range of applications in AC and DC charging equipment. In addition to these important applications in our highly diverse industrial segment, our high-performance signal processing platforms and domain expertise are helping to electrify the automotive market. Here, our technology is a key enabler in the transition from combustion engines to cleaner electric vehicles by increasing range and lowering cost. And I'll start with BMS. As we've shared before, we are the leader in this area with our BMS solution designed into 16 of the top 20 EV manufacturers. We're currently sampling our eighth generation solution, which utilizes software and algorithms to enable physical measurement capabilities all the way into the battery cell. These advances in edge processing change the game in how the internal battery health is managed, supporting faster charging and better range prediction. An extension of this is our wireless BMS solution, a first in the industry. It has all the benefits of our wired solution and enables a scalable battery architecture, with quicker and more cost-effective production cycles. Currently, our wireless BMS is designed in at four OEMs, and we expect another large OEM to adopt it in the coming quarters. Given this momentum and the cutting-edge value proposition, we believe the wireless platform will represent a large portion of our BMS revenue by the end of the decade. And looking ahead, we're broadening our EV capabilities beyond battery management and storage to power conversion solutions. Specifically, we're developing a silicon carbide-based smart switch for bidirectional onboard charging that significantly reduces charger size and weight by over 50%, thus driving down cost. Notably, this intelligent integrated switch enables the EV to transfer energy back into the network, creating a more reliable grid. And this innovation solution more than doubles our content opportunity per EV powertrain. So in summary, ADI is driven by a deep sense of purpose and a desire for our innovations to positively impact all stakeholders. We're immensely proud of the role our technologies play to improve the well-being of humanity and indeed the planet, and I remain very confident in our future. Our portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, world-class talent base are aligned with an unprecedented number of attractive secular trends, where the semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx is increasing tremendously. This presents ADI with continued profitable growth opportunities as well as the ability to shape the future of industries. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. While demand continued to soften throughout the quarter, ADI delivered nearly $3.1 billion revenue, in line with our guidance. This was driven by continued year-over-year growth for both Industrial and Automotive. Looking at our performance by end market. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue, finished down 7% sequentially after a tremendous stretch of 13 straight quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% with most applications up, led by sustainable energy as well as aerospace and defense, which each grew double digits. Automotive, which represented 24% of revenue, was down modestly sequentially in line with our expectations. Year-over-year growth of 15% was broad-based. We saw continued outsized growth for ADI's leading battery management and in-cabin connectivity solutions, which collectively increased nearly 30% year-over-year. Communications, which represented 12% of revenue, decreased double digits, both sequentially and year-over-year due to the broad-based inventory correction we flagged previously. And lastly, consumer, which represented 10% of revenue came in stronger than expected, finishing up 15% sequentially, but down 21% year-over-year. We remain optimistic that our second quarter marked the bottom for this business despite the ongoing inventory correction. And now on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin of 72.2% remains industry-leading, but declined sequentially due to lower utilization and product mix. Operating expenses of $752 million were roughly flat year-over-year and up sequentially. This quarter's OpEx reflects the full impact of annual merit increases. Operating margin of 47.8% contracted 230 basis points year-over-year, roughly in line with the gross margin decline. Non-op expenses were $57 million, and our tax rate was 11.2%. All told, EPS came in at $2.49 within our guidance range. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Given the revenue pressures and our decision to hold more finished goods versus restocking the channel, inventory dollars increased and the days of inventory moved higher to 179. As a result, channel inventory remains below our target level and slightly declined. Specifically, we strategically undershipped Asia, especially China, due to weaker demand trends. CapEx was $325 million for the quarter as we invest to enhance ADI's global resiliency and offer our customers options on where their products are sourced. 2023 should represent the high watermark for CapEx, and we expect it to decline in 2024. Importantly, our investments do not include the benefits of tax credit and grant funds that we anticipate from both the U.S. and the European Chips Act. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 29% of revenue. And over the same period, we've returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders or over 130% of free cash flow via more than $3.3 billion in buybacks and more than $1.6 billion in dividends. Now turning to the Q4 guidance. We expect the fourth quarter revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus $100 million. This outlook assumes sell-in to be below sell-through. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect all markets to be down sequentially given the broad-based inventory correction. On a relative basis, Auto and Consumer should perform a bit better than Industrial and Comms. Operating margin is expected to be 44% plus or minus 70 basis points. This margin outlook embeds planned utilization reductions and a decline in OpEx. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2 plus or minus $0.10. As our outlook is lower than expected, let me provide some context on what we're experiencing and how we will navigate. Our revenue outlook reflects the broad-based macro softness across all end markets, all geographies and customers both large and small. We are also strategically improving lead times to get a better view into demand and enhance customer satisfaction. Today, we're shipping over 85% of our products within 13 weeks, and this is up from 35% a year ago. As Vince mentioned, we are seeing customers accelerate inventory adjustments due to both the softer environment and our lead time improvements. And as such, we're taking measures to preserve the integrity of our balance sheet, cash flow and income statement. This includes further reducing utilization and lowering external wafer purchases with a goal to decrease inventory meaningfully in the coming quarters. And importantly, as we've outlined before, we expect gross margins will maintain a 70% level on a trailing 12-month basis. This gross margin resiliency is a testament to the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model and our unique swing capacity capability. In addition to the naturally lower variable comp, we're also taking steps to reduce total OpEx by roughly $50 million sequentially. So stepping back, we're not ready to call the bottom yet but our history shows that we cycle up quickly. And when we do, we will achieve higher highs. ADI has built a very resilient business, rich with opportunities. Our diversification and exposure to numerous secular trends drives our durable earnings stream and solid free cash flow, enabling us to consistently return capital to shareholders. And to that end, over the trailing 12 months, we've returned $5 billion to shareholders or more than 5% of our market cap. As this is my last ADI earnings call, I'd like to give a quick thank you to Vince for his mentorship and counsel over the past six years to the ADI Board, including our audit chair, Karen Golz, for their unwavering support and most importantly, to the world-class finance staff, including young Mike here for always reminding us of our commitments to you, the company's owners. I look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks as we get on the road. Mike, let's go to Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Prashanth. I don't think I've been called young in some time, but I appreciate that. Now let's get to our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, can be our first question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. I have a question for Vince. So I know you're not ready to call a bottom. But some industry observers would say that this sort of inventory build started maybe late 2021, early 2022 based on your guidance for the October quarter, you're sort of back to that level. So then you've seen these cycles, you've seen many of them. They're all different. But just wanted to get a sense for you what you think we're getting close, especially given what I just said about that inventory adjustment now sort of being complete? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Tore. When I look at this current cycle, the symptoms are always the same in these cycles, but the causes tend to have different components. And I think right now, there are two kind of inputs to this particular correction. I think one is the inventory in digestion that exists out there that has been building for 18, 24 months now. And the second, of course, is the macroeconomic situation, which is a major governor as well. But I think if you look at what we understand from the direct side of our business, for example, when we look at our largest customers revenue growth and their forecast compared to our growth at these very same customers, we believe that we've been shipping the low-end consumption in the third and will in the fourth quarter. So I think one way to look at this is how long will the inventory correction take? My sense is it will be two to three quarters before we get through the inventory digestion cycle, and I think we're positioned as a company to get beyond it quite fast because we've been managing our factories very carefully, managing our inventories, both on our own balance sheet as well as our distribution channel. So we've also, I think, taken a long-term view to the demand patterns of our customers. We haven't, in any way, forced them into, for example, long-term supply agreements, essentially, at this point in the cycle, that will be forcing them to take products that they don't really need. We've been managing our channel aggressively. So as I said, we're keeping more inventory on our own balance sheet. So again, we will get to distribute the supply ultimately where we think it's needed when the recovery gets underway here. So that's my sense, sorry. I mean, in the industry, if you look back to the dot com cycle, you look at the 2008 financial crisis cycle, most of the downturns tended to last three to four quarters. So my sense is over the next two, three quarters, we begin to see a recovery here, at least on the inventory side. And then it's really a question of how does the macro-economy perform? Tore Svanberg : Great perspective. Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks Tori. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks Dan. Best wishes again to Prashanth on his next adventure. You said that you're not ready to call the bottom yet and Vince, you mentioned that the inventory digestion period could last for some more time. How should we think about Q1 seasonality? It tends to be down kind of mid-single digit. Do you think we should be prepared for something different than that? Right? And if it is worse than kind of mid-single digit, do you still think that ADI can maintain gross margins above 70%. So just kind of puts and takes to help us align our models would be very useful. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Why don't I take that, Vivek. So first, quick comments just to make sure everyone has the Q4 guide, correct. So on the channel, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are shipping in below the forecast we have from our channel partners. So we are intentionally bringing channel inventories down to help set us up for some better strength. The -- included in the guide is the backlog coverage has some turns, but less than normal given the higher level of uncertainty. So we would need some more turns and positive book-to-bill, which Vince mentioned is likely to be a quarter or two out. And then just from an end market standpoint, we've got all end markets down quarter-over-quarter. So as you know, we don't guide out further than the current quarter, but some color is I think you essentially have it right. There's no reason to think that first quarter would not be down seasonal on a, which would call it, mid-single digit quarter-over-quarter. But that we -- our view is going to be driven by the holidays and the customer decisions to reduce inventory as they go into the year-end. So we're not, at this point, seeing a more meaningful step down in Q1 based on what we can know today. And I will just remember to plant and everyone as you start to model out Q1 that every once in a couple of years, we have a 14-week quarter, and that will be Q1 of '24. And then on gross margins, I think we're actually quite proud of our gross margin story here that we've been -- we've messaged a number of times that we would have the ability to maintain a 70% gross margin in a -- on a trailing 12-month basis with a peak to trough decline of 15%. Q4 is down about 17% from the Q2 peak. And while we didn't give you a gross margin number, if you impute it from the OpEx math that I gave you, you'll see that we are able to hold that north of 70%, and we'll continue to work that. For Q1, gross margins, my best sense now would be that we are likely to face a little more challenge on the utilization level as we bring inventory levels down, but we have been very successful in activating our swing capacity. We're actually doing about 10% better on utilizations because we have swing than if we hadn't activated it. So it's been a very powerful lever for us. And we need to see how the math on all of that works out for Q1, but I wouldn't expect Q1 to be notably different from kind of where we are for Q4. Vincent Roche : Yes. I'd like to add one other comment, Vivek, to what Prashanth has said. So the other side of margin is pricing, and pricing is very stable. It's very, very stable, resilient. I don't expect that to change. And our products are very, very sticky. We've got tremendous life cycles and that part of our business, this is really a unit correction in the business rather than price or share. Vivek Arya : Thanks for that. Helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is open. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. This is old Ambrish, Young Mike, can feel free to chime in. I was looking at the year-over-year comms, and I look at TI as your closest peer rival competitor. Vince, they started going into a year-over-year decline in 4Q '22 and you are just starting, and you said two to three quarters. So in the past history does suggest that usually on a year-over-year basis, we see roughly around four to five quarters of year decline. Is that the right way to think about your business? You said two to three quarters of digestion and I'm assuming that means year-over-year decline in reps, right? Vincent Roche : Yes. Good question, Ambrish. So yes, look, I mean, Comms is just a piece of ADI's overall story. We've actually seen -- I mean, we have two components as well. We've got wire line, we have wireless. I would say on the wire line side of things, we've seen the malaise going back into the late part of '22, early part of '23. So that's really things like optical control for data center and carrier networks, and power. We've got a power business there as well. So we think we'll see that, we expect to see CapEx somewhat recover in that space to be able to catch up with the needs, for example, driven by the explosion in computing power that's required to handle the AI inflection here, for example. So -- my sense is the wire line part will probably start its recovery in the first -- second quarter of the year. Wireless is a little harder to call. It's very, very dynamic. We all know that. The developed countries, particularly North America, 5G deployments, which have really been focused on coverage rather than capacity. They're going to be weaker than we thought. So that's probably going to give us headwinds for how long, we don't know, but I think it could be several quarters during our FY '24. India has been very strong this year, of course. And I think we're expecting to see more commitments to lay in both coverage and capacity in India during our FY '24. So look, we've got leadership in many of these areas, like optical control systems, 5G, software-defined solutions. It's really a question of timing in my mind. But -- there's a lot of uncertainty in the communications market in totality and particularly in wireless at this point. So hopefully, that gives you the answer to your question. Ambrish Srivastava : Well, I was asking about the overall business, Vince, not just about the Comms, sorry. Vincent Roche : Okay. yes. Look, I think, Ambrish, the overall business. We see some trends, for example, that will transcend the inventory digestion problem. And even the macro-economy areas like digital healthcare, like aerospace and defense, the sustainable energy theme that we spoke to a little while ago. So again, I will just reiterate my sense is the inventory digestion problem will last probably two, three quarters, and then we'll get back into a unit volume increase from there on. Ambrish Srivastava : Thank you. Vincent Roche : Thanks Ambrish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys, thanks so much for taking my question. Prashanth, I don't want to be pedantic on Q1, but I know you said right now, down seasonal, but also as an extra week. That extra week, if I just linearize it is like a plus 7. So do those cancel out? Or is it like it's the week between Christmas and New Year, so it's not a lot of revenue? Or just how do I think about the balance of those two things into Q1, assuming a Q1 that was... Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So when I gave you my comments of down seasonal that was on a 13-week basis, the 14-week was just a reminder as you model it. So Mike, do you want to do the math, but I think you're essentially thinking about it right. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. So as Prashanth said, let's take a first 13-week quarter. What happens normally in 1Q and a 13-week quarter our business is down, call it, 5%, plus or minus, total business. Now with an extra week, that adds about 7.5%, both on the revenue side and the OpEx side. So there's two pieces, normal, down 5% total company, in the 14-week quarter, you can add 7.5% of revenue and OpEx. That's the best way to think about it. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And thank you for clarifying that, Stacy, I wasn't clear in my answer. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. And then that would drop off into Q2, though, you go the other way in Q2. So Q2 under like normal circumstances would be worse than seasonal because you have that extra week drop off? Michael Lucarelli : Yes. So again, you can parse it in normal times, 2Q is up, call it, 2% to 5% and a 13-week to 13-week quarter, if you take away an extra week, yes, you have a 7.5% headwind. They have got 1Q. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. I have another one, but I guess I don't want to get that band next time, so I.... Michael Lucarelli : I'll allow another question because that's a good clarifying question, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. I just wanted to ask about OpEx into next year. So it sounds like you're guiding it to about $700 million in the Q4. How do I think about it next year into a revenue year that's likely to be down potentially reasonably materially. Like how should we think about OpEx just year-over-year for fiscal '24 versus '23? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. I think, Stacy, as we've always said, we run this business for the long term. So we're going to make the adjustments that are prudent to make on the discretionary side, adjusting the variable comp and where we can, but the value of this company comes from its innovation. So I wouldn't expect meaningfully more attack on the spending into 2024. But remember that our variable comp is designed to be highly accordion. So if '24 plays out as a down year, you will see that meaningfully unwind for us. Anything else... Stacy Rasgon : Is that $700 million runway Mike, is that like the right run rate to think about? Michael Lucarelli : That's not a crazy level to think about for the year. I think if you take a step back and look at kind of what we're trying to manage within our control. We talked about gross margin maintaining at 70% a trailing 12-month basis. So for the full year, I think we can do 70% gross margins, and our goal is to maintain our operating margins within our long-term target and the low end of that account 42% to 45%. So that's kind of some guardrails we think about as you're modeling out next year and what would be a down year for revenue. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Thank you, guys. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks Stacy. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is open. Chris Danely : Hi. Thanks guys. Congrats Prashanth on retirement. I wish I was joining you. I just had a question on the Auto end market. So you're saying that you expect it to do, I guess, better relatively than Industrial. Given how much inventory has been built there, and the upcoming UAW strike, do you think it's possible that Auto could get materially worse? Are you baking that into any kind of forecast? And then are you I guess, Auto supply chain customers talking about a potential strike and the impact on their inventory. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. All right. So thank you for the question. Chris, I think we're going to see you in a couple of weeks in New York. So on Auto, I guess some context first, we've grown for 12 consecutive quarters year-over-year. And including the fourth quarter, we're going to be up again. We said in the prepared comments that the lead times and the confidence supply is driving some of that acceleration in inventory adjustments and that's happening across all our markets. When we look specifically at Auto in the quarter and our growth rates there, the same strong growers, BMS, GMSL, A2B. They grew in the third quarter and both on a sequential basis and year-over-year. We expect kind of the similar strength from them into the fourth quarter. So I think that our outlook is, as Vince said, is really end market units driven and we have not yet put in a number nor have we received indicators from our supply chain partners that we should be making adjustments based on any disruption that could come from the negotiations that are going on right now. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think one other thing, Chris, to note is that, in general, there's more and more silicon value in cars every year, and that's true of ADI. We've got the switch to the electrification, which is, again, in pretty much the early stages of adoption. So there are some great growth drivers that will somewhat transcend the malaise, the economic malaise. But we still expect, overall, as Prashanth said, we've got many growth drivers that Automotive will continue to be the one of the better growth areas for ADI for the foreseeable future. Chris Danely : Great. Thanks, guys. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur : Hi. Good morning. Sorry about that. So in Q3, disti was down, was about 62% of sales. It was down about 4.5% sequentially. So that's less than the total business. Shipments to our direct customers came down around 8%. So maybe you guys can just discuss the shipments and excess inventory dynamics around both for Q3 and here in Q4. Is the excess inventory situation a little bit more pronounced than direct customers? And maybe similar to your disti customers where you have systems in place to monitor sell-through? Like how do you monitor the levels of sell-through and inventories at your direct customers? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Great. Okay. So let's do a couple of pieces on that. First, as a reminder, for a distribution company to do business with ADI, you have to give us your sell-through data on a weekly basis in arrears via electronic data feed. So we know exactly where our distribution guys are doing business, and we use that to run the company, as Vince always said, we run it on a POS basis. We said in the third sorry, in the second quarter earnings call, we said that we had gotten a little ahead of ourselves in China and that we intended to undership China. In the third quarter, we have done that. We are now intending to undership all markets generally in the fourth quarter to continue to bring the channel level inventories down. We have limited direct data visibility into our end customers inventory levels, except for those customers where we have consignment. But what we do have is the which you don't have access to is we can see the sales data of our products into our broad set of publicly external customers and their corresponding revenue growth. And our team builds correlation data based on that to tell us how we're doing versus how their growth is. And that's what Vince was referring to that we have seen that their growth is accelerating versus our growth to them, which is why we have confidence that we are undershipping their end market demand, allowing them to pull inventory levels down, which, of course, it is safe to do so because now we can get our products to them within 13 weeks. Michael Lucarelli : Yes. Prashanth that's a great point you made the less lead times is the best indicator of what our customers' inventory levels need to be. if a customer can get product quick, they need to hold a little less inventory. So our lead time is improving is helping us give us better visibility into what the customers need to hold and what they're holding. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think Prashanth said earlier, 85% of our total portfolio now is available in less than 13 weeks. Big, big change since this time last year. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Harlan. Harlan Sur : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I had two quick ones, if I may. One on pricing. Vince, you mentioned that in the near term, it's more of a unit correction as opposed to a correction in pricing, which makes sense. To the extent foundry pricing improves into 2024, would you be in a position to share that sort of cost down, if you will, with customers the same way you've sort of passed on higher costs over the past couple of years? And then a second quick one for Prashanth. DOI 179, I think that's up, call it, 50, 60 days vis-a-vis pre-pandemic. How should we think about the new normal going forward? And how quickly can you get there? Vincent Roche : Sure. Let me answer the pricing piece first, Toshiya. There are really two parts to it. One is we have 75,000 product SKUs that are established and are the bedrock of the franchise of the ADI. They're very sticky. The product life cycles tend to be very, very strong. And they tend to be once they're designed and fairly price insensitive. And we're actually -- we're also, by the way, increasing the value of our products each year. We're managing the portfolio in terms of pricing. We're looking for elasticity, which is just a normal part of portfolio management. But -- we're also adding more value to the products that we're introducing to customers, the new products. I think the benefit of lower costs will come at the design-in phase if we do get lower cost, which from our third-party which, by the way, I think, is very, very unlikely. So I think the message is pricing is stable and very, very franchise is very durable. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And I'll do the DOI one very quickly here, Toshi. So 179 days, balance sheet inventory grew call it, low single digits sequentially on a dollar basis. We have high confidence that we will exit Q1, taking out at least $100 million of inventory value. and the production plans are being oriented to allow us to do that. The days target, we have a model, but we've agreed that it is appropriate for the next CFO really to bless that model because they're going to own that and they need to kind of go through that map. So I can tell you that it's not going to be at 180 days, but I don't think we get back to 120 days. So we'll come back to you at some point on what that looks like. Toshiya Hari : That's very helpful. Thank you, both. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks Toshi. Take last question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Josh Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Josh Buchalter : Hi, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. And Prashanth, congratulations on the great run. You mentioned a few times under shipping in the print and the guidance. I was hoping you could maybe quantify the extent or maybe provide any sort of guidance to the amount that you're under shipping? And then given it sounds like seasonal fiscal first quarter isn't off the table. Does that mean we kind of expect you could be shipping to end demand exiting the October quarter? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I'll let Mike take the second part of that question because I'm not sure I fully comprehended it. But on the first one, so we have our business that goes through the channel and the business that goes direct. Business through the channel, we have the demand forecast from our distribution guys, and we are under shipping into the channel to help them pull inventory levels in the channel down. We said that in the second quarter earnings call that we were going to do that for China. This quarter, we're going to do it across the globe for all distis. Your second question on how to think about the under shipment into end demand that Vince referenced to. All I can really do is refer back to sort of the data analysis that we do. There's not a real way to aggregate that, except to say that we have a relatively good correlation between our end customers revenue growth and our growth to those end customers on an individual basis and when we look at how they grew in third quarter versus our shipments to them and how they're forecasting or you guys or consensus forecasting their fourth quarter growth versus our shipments to them, we know that we're going to be helping them to pull inventory levels down, which again makes tremendous sense because lead times have improved. And Mike, I didn't... Michael Lucarelli : Sure. On the first -- it's good question. If you look at the first quarter, we always typically undership consumption in the first quarter, why? You see a lot of our customers reduce their working capital going into end of the year-end. So the down 5% in our -- seeing the seasonal first quarter is below consumption. I think after that, you get back to kind of what Vince was saying you get coming back to demand and consumption, all kind of imbalance. And then it comes to a question of macro, what's happening in macro in our second quarter. Thank you, Josh. Josh Buchalter : Okay. Definitely helpful. Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Any time. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We once again will be on the road a lot this quarter. You'll find us in New York, Chicago, Florida, London and San Fran. Reach out to IR team to be notified when we are in your ZIP code. And with that, thanks for joining us and the interest in ADI. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Abigail and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI\u2019s CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s Interim CFO, Jim Mollica. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it in relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On our disclosures, the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information. These statements reflect our expectations only as the call today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Our references to gross and operating margin, operating and non-op expenses, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow will be on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from our prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release. Two comments before we go prepared remarks. We adjusted our mapping to better align revenue to customer end markets. This resulted in slight changes to our end market mix with industrial increasing at each of the other markets slightly lower. These changes are reflected on our web schedule in the quarterly results section for the last 3 years. And second, one more quick reminder, the first quarter of 2024 is a 14-week quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO and Chair, Vincent. Vincent Roche : Thank you very much, Mike and a very good morning to you all. Though the industry is obviously moving through a more challenging period of the business cycle, I am very pleased to share that we are preserving the strength of our financial performance while preparing for the market\u2019s recovery. Fourth quarter revenue was $2.7 billion, led by double-digit year-over-year growth in our automotive sector. The combination of careful expense management and our employees\u2019 commitment to high standards of execution enabled us to deliver operating margins of 44.7% and EPS of $2.01 for the quarter. For the fiscal year, \u201823 again set new high watermarks with revenue reaching $12.3 billion, supported by all-time highs in the industrial and automotive sectors. This resulted in EPS of $10.09 up 5% from a year ago. Notably, we returned a record $4.6 billion to shareholders in 2023, exceeding our 100% free cash flow return target. Since the closing of Maxim just over 2 years ago, ADI has returned roughly $12 billion to shareholders or nearly 15% of our market cap. Over the same time, we have reduced our share count by more than 6% and increased our dividend per share by 25%. Now looking to fiscal \u201824, the near-term dynamics remain uncertain. As you will recall, last quarter, we outlined a broad-based inventory correction across all markets and geographies, reflecting the deteriorating macro conditions and our improving lead times. Consistent with our view 90 days ago, we expect the customer inventory overhang to persist through the first half of the year. Challenging times like these confirm the wisdom and the strength of our business model. The diversification of our business across customers, applications and products helps to limit volatility while preserving profitability. Building upon that foundation, we took actions to better ensure we can deliver operating margins in the low 40s and solid free cash flow despite the revenue decline. Importantly, however, we are not simply battening down the hatches. Our resilient financial model enables us to continue making the strategic investments necessary to allow us to capitalize on the upside when the business inflects higher. That longer term focus and commitment is why our customers have the confidence to increasingly depend on us as a key strategic partner. I have been very heartened by my conversations with customers across many markets and geographies over this past quarter. Despite the near-term challenges, they share our optimism that the intelligent edge is enabling a future replete with opportunity, and they are clear about the expanding role that they expect ADI to play in their success. Our customers\u2019 optimism is reflected in the continued expansion of our design win pipeline, which increased by double-digits again in 2023. That growth was enhanced by sustained momentum in our Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, which is tracking ahead of our initial expectations. We expect synergy-driven revenue acceleration in 2025 putting us on a path to achieve our goal of more than $1 billion in revenue synergy by 2027. The combination of our strong design win growth with recurring revenue streams from our 75,000 product SKUs, which have average life spans of a decade or more creates a business with high barriers to entry that\u2019s both resilient and rich with growth opportunities. Now, let me share some examples of recent wins with you. In Industrial Automation, we are increasingly delivering more complete solutions. At a top digital factory automation supplier, for example, we have recently leveraged our anchor position in software configurable I/O to attach additional solutions value across power, isolation and connectivity. As a result, we captured 3x the bill of materials and secured design wins across their entire platform. In Industrial Instrumentation, we have increased our design wins at SOC and memory test market leaders. Our next-generation solutions increased channel density and throughput while reducing energy consumption by up to an incredible 30% per system. These are critical parameters for testing complex, high-performance compute GPUs and high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence systems. Looking now to automotive. In electrification, momentum continues for our wireless battery management system. This novel solution enables lower weight, greater scalability and improved manufacturing productivity, driving down the total cost of ownership for our customers while increasing ADI\u2019s content. Last quarter, we secured our fifth customer, a top 10 EV OEM. We\u2019ll begin to deploy our wireless solution in their next-gen EVs in 2026. Now furthermore, during the year, ADI reinforced our industry-leading position in automotive, high-performance functionally save power. To that end, we won next-generation power for ADAS systems at four top suppliers this past year. These wins add another growth vector to our automotive franchise, which has benefited from strong momentum across electrification and in-cabin connectivity. This proliferation of ADAS is benefiting our high-speed GMSL connectivity portfolio. GMSL has been one of our fastest growing areas and a major revenue synergy generator for us. In the last year, we were awarded 4 new wins across leading North American, Asian and European OEMs. We are also expanding our opportunity and increasing our ROI, winning multiple design wins in industrial areas \u2013 in adjacent areas such as autonomous robotic systems. Our cloud infrastructure business is beginning to benefit from the power challenges and connectivity requirements necessary in AI ML systems. Notably, a large hyperscaler designed our high-performance power and protection solutions into their next-generation AI platform. And in connectivity, systems are upgrading now to 1 terabit per second and require our highest level of precision control solutions to efficiently support the growth in data generation. In consumer, we won multiple power management sockets in a portable application and a key customer. These wins truly show the combinatorial power of our acquisition strategy. We leveraged our industry leading cell and switcher, Maxim\u2019s cost optimized process technology, and our customer relationships to secure these wins. And lastly, in healthcare, Maxim strengthened our comprehensive suite of technology for personal monitoring solutions, adding sensor AFEs, microcontrollers and ultra-low power technologies. We secured a design win at a leading continuous glucose monitoring customer this year. Our solution increases the robustness, accuracy and power efficiency of their glucose center, thereby helping to extend its life from days to weeks. So in summary, we\u2019re proud of another year of record revenue and earnings. We continue to demonstrate the power of our business model, which delivers results through all phases of the business cycle. Our continued strong investments in technology and business innovation, customer engagement, and our hybrid manufacturing model positions ADI and our customers to take maximum advantage of the opportunities at the intelligent edge when the business recovery arrives. Now I\u2019d like to pass the call over to Jim. Over the past 35 years, Jim has taken on a number of critical financial leadership roles across ADI, enabling him to develop a breadth and depth of understanding of our business that very, very few possess. So I\u2019m pleased now to have him on my leadership team and to be joined by Jim on today\u2019s call. Over to you, Jim. Jim Mollica : Thank you for that introduction, Vince, I\u2019m excited to be here today, and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Starting with a brief recap of fiscal 2023 results. Revenue increased 2% to $12.3 billion, marking ADI\u2019s third consecutive record year. Gross margin of 72.5% moderated from last year\u2019s record results of 73.6%. Operating margin of 48.9% decreased 50 basis points, roughly half the decline of gross margin, reflecting strong operating expense control. All told, EPS increased 5% to a record $10.09. Now moving to fourth quarter results. Revenue of $2.72 billion declined 12% sequentially and 16% year-over-year, finishing above the midpoint of our outlook despite the challenging operating environment. Industrial represented 50% of quarterly revenue, declining 19% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. As expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as inventory adjustments continued across our diverse customer base. For the full year, Industrial increased 6%, achieving its third straight record result with strength across instrumentation, test, energy and aerospace and defense. Automotive, which represented 27% of quarterly revenue was down slightly sequentially and up 14% year-over-year, marking 12 straight quarters of double-digit growth. For the year, Automotive also achieved its third straight record result, increasing 19%, with strong growth across our functionally safe power, battery management and in cabin connectivity solutions. Collectively, these were up more than 30%. Communications, which represented 13% of quarterly revenue, declined 6% sequentially and 32% versus a record fourth quarter 2022. For the year, Communications decreased 13%, with steeper declines in wireless versus wireline. And lastly, Consumer represented 11% of quarterly revenue, down 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Consumer decreased 20% in fiscal 2023, driven by industry-wide weaker demand and ongoing inventory corrections. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 70.2%, down sequentially and year-over-year driven by unfavorable product mix, lower factory utilizations and lower revenue. OpEx in the quarter was $692 million, down $60 million sequentially. These significant savings were driven by disciplined expense management and lower variable compensation. As a result, operating margin came in at the higher end of our outlook of 44.7%. Non-op expense finished at $65 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 12.5%. All told, EPS was $2.01, slightly above our outlook. Now on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. Inventory decreased nearly $70 million sequentially, driven by finished goods. Channel inventory also declined as we actively manage sell-in to be less than sell-through. Given lower revenue, inventory days increased to 188 and channel weeks ticked up slightly, ending within our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. Now moving on to our cash flow items. Operating cash for the quarter and the year was $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. CapEx for the quarter was $476 million and for fiscal 2023 was $1.3 billion. These CapEx numbers are gross figures, which do not include the benefits of the investment tax credits or grants related to both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Full year free cash flow was $3.6 billion or 29% of revenue. During the year, we returned 130% of free cash flow via roughly $3 billion in share repurchases and $1.7 billion in dividends. Now moving on to the guidance for the first quarter, which will be on a 14-week basis. First quarter revenue is expected to be $2.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Once again, we expect sell-through to be higher than sell-in. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to be down sequentially. Industrial is expected to be down the most, followed by Consumer and Comms with Automotive faring the best. Operating margin is expected to be 41.5%, plus or minus 70 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.70 plus or minus $0.10. I will conclude my remarks with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As Vince mentioned, we continue to see broad-based weakness across markets and geographies as customers work to reduce inventory and a stressed macro backdrop. Importantly, our lead times are now back to normal levels with 95% of our products shipping within 13 weeks, given our customers high confidence and timely supply. Encouragingly, during the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve seen cancellations fall and bookings stabilize. This gives us greater confidence that the ongoing inventory correction will taper through the first half of the fiscal year. As we discussed last time, we\u2019ve taken actions to preserve the integrity of our income statement, our balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Let me provide an update in these areas. We are once again lowering internal utilizations with a goal of significantly reducing inventory in the first half of the year. Our hybrid manufacturing model and ability to swing in external wafers will help us moderate the decline in factory starts. The unique ability positions us to deliver healthy gross margins despite the significant revenue decline from a year ago. Given the enhancements made to our hybrid manufacturing model over the last 2 years, we now plan to slow the expansion of our internal fabs and back-end facilities. As a result, we expect 2024 CapEx to be between $600 million and $800 million or down about 45% versus 2023. Importantly, this CapEx reduction does not compromise our long-term growth or resiliency efforts that gives customers multiple locations to source ADI supply. And lastly, we took additional steps to structurally reduce our OpEx. These actions, combined with lower variable comp and seasonally lower spend in the first quarter will result in a slight decline in OpEx sequentially even with the extra week. So in closing, our ability to generate operating margins in the low 40s, which were our previous highs in the last cycle demonstrates the durability of this franchise and how we\u2019ve enhanced our operating model over time. And with that, I\u2019ll give it back to Mike for Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Jim. Welcome to the call. It\u2019s great to have you. Now let\u2019s get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, we will have our first question please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is open. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi, thank you. Thank you very much for taking my question. Vince, it looks like order has been restored in the diversified Analog world with \u2013 it looks like a very normal cyclical downturn and with you, what you\u2019ve built is a structurally more profitable company holding to 40% \u2013 low 40% operating margin line. My question is on a bottoming process. And I know we\u2019re not there yet, but can you just remind us or help us understand metrics you\u2019re following regarding cancellations, pushouts, backlog, you did talk about cancellations, Jim. And then kind of related to that, is if you look at past cycles, does automotive needs to go down double-digit year-over-year decline as industrial has been there? And how should we think about that? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. God morning, Ambrish, and thank you for the question. So yes, we noted last quarter that we believe the inventory digestion issue would last two to three quarters. And I\u2019d say, given the new information that we have, our conviction of that has actually grown. We have, through careful analysis and observation, we\u2019ve seen inventory digestion accelerate at our largest direct customers across the board and across all the various segments that we support. And we\u2019re continuing to reduce our channel inventories as well. So I think very encouragingly, even with normalized lead times, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re shipping that kind of 95% of customer requests within a quarter, which is very, very normal. We saw against that backdrop, a sharp drop in cancellations, and though the book-to-bill was below unity in the fourth quarter. We did see our bookings improve sequentially. So that gives us a lot of confidence as to what\u2019s going on. Regarding Automotive, I\u2019m not sure, by the way. The automotive \u2013 the assumption you\u2019re making is that there could be a double-digit drop in Automotive. I\u2019m not sure about that because we know that cars are consuming about 10% more silicon per year. And in fact, we continue to grow in share and ASP in the car. So my own sense is that against what could be a very challenging macro backdrop during 2024, that of all the elements of our portfolio, automotive, we expect will fare best of them all. And we still have pretty strong confidence that we\u2019ll grow in 2024. Ambrish Srivastava : Thank you, Vince. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Ambrish. Next question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. Vince, I\u2019m trying to reconcile the comments that were made about some stabilization in bookings. That sounds like a positive. But I think in the prepared remarks, you also said some headwinds that could persist through the first half of the fiscal year, suggesting that April could be a sub-seasonal quarter. So I know you\u2019re not guiding specifically out to April, but what is the right way to look at the puts and takes as we think about April? Can it be seasonal, whether it not be seasonal? And also this extra week from January, did that really give you that 7.5% push, so we should be taking that out of April. So any way to help us give us a sense for how the April could shape up would be very helpful. Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 Vivek, thank you for the question. It\u2019s one quarter at a time here. What I will say contextually is that we expect the inventory overhang to have been depleted by the start of our third quarter, which is in May of next year. So, we still remain pretty confident about that, given the dynamics that I just outlined. But the other parts of the cycle that we\u2019re really \u2013 I think everybody is seeing pressure from is the macroeconomic climate and particularly the decline of semi business in China. So that\u2019s the piece. I mean that is the piece that isn\u2019t well understood. But all that said, the macro will be the governor on what happens in the second half of the year. And I think another quarter or so will give us a lot more confidence in terms of what is possible in the second half. But I will let Jim answer as well give you some particular statistics to underpin our assumptions here. Jim Mollica : Thanks, Vince. Yes, let me just speak to \u2013 let me unpack lead times a bit first. As we said, lead times are now kind of back to where they were, 95% of our products are shipping within 13 weeks. And we\u2019ve seen steady improvement in lead times in both 3Q and 4Q. And I guess from the refreshing side of that is from a customer viewpoint, customers have now adjusted to those shorter lead times. And our order rates basically in the fourth quarter basically stabilized in fact, picked up in 4Q versus 3Q. So that\u2019s good news for us as the customers have shopped and their signal into us. As Vince said, our book-to-bill will still be low on there, but it is kind of the first lines there. Additionally, cancellations in the fourth quarter were down meaningfully for the first time and probably close to a year. And cancellations on a shorter time fence were also very, very low. So that\u2019s good for us. From a channel perspective, we\u2019re being cautious. We continue to basically ship into the channel less than our sell-through, which basically will position us well for when the upswing occurs. And from an end market viewpoint, let me just close on that point. All markets in 1Q will be down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Yes, that\u2019s it. Mike, anything else? Michael Lucarelli : Yes. And it\u2019s very confusing with a 13 to 14-week card, you\u2019re right, Vivek. I\u2019ll kind of add some commentary around that, how to think about that. Normally, 2Q from 1Q and a 13-week to 13-week basis up about 5%. And given what have been said, inventory overhang and bookings getting better. It still feels like we should probably grow some, but I don\u2019t think 5% is likely. Why? There\u2019s still an inventory overhang going on. So if you think 13-week to 13-week were about flattish, plus or minus, in 1Q to 2Q, that\u2019s probably the way to think about it. That means if you include the extra week, it\u2019s probably down about 5% plus or minus sequentially. So I hope that helps back a little bit because it is confusing. And with that we go to our next question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder, I mean now that you\u2019re in a revenue downturn that looks more severe than we saw the last cycle, what are you seeing in terms of pricing? And are people \u2013 you obviously raised prices during the upturn. Are people asking you to give that back? And is that a different conversation on kind of a like-for-like basis versus approaching kind of new design win activity? Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks, Joe. So look, I think overall, the pricing of our existing portfolio is very, very resilient, very stable. And I think something to note as well is that every new generation of product that we build is capturing more value. And \u2013 so if you look at the legacy, it\u2019s very stable. You look at the legacy franchise. We\u2019ve got tremendous stability. We\u2019re capturing more new value per new socket. And I don\u2019t see any particular change. And we, as a company, play at the high end of the performance curve, which enables us to get this innovation premium that is a very, very critical part of our gross margin structure and our revenue growth. And our job is to continue to invest to make sure that we stay on the cutting edge and get well rewarded for that. We fight very, very intensely at the inception of new designs. But as I said in the prepared remarks, Joe, we\u2019re seeing generally speaking, our pipeline of new product design wins as well as the more established products continue to grow quarter-by-quarter, year-over-year. So I feel confident that the pricing that we have managed to increase over the last couple of years, 2.5 years that they\u2019re about to reflect the increased cost of goods. We\u2019ll hold those prices. So overall, we\u2019re bullish about where we are and what the pricing environment holds in the future. Joseph Moore : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Joe. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on OpEx and gross margins into Q1. So you said OpEx was down slightly even with the extra week. So, if I sort of understand a little bit, it would imply the normalized like 13-week OpEx would be running around, I don\u2019t know, 640 maybe, maybe a little lower. Once we get through into Q2 when the ex-week rolls off, is that the right sort of like steady-state OpEx run rate to think about as we go through the year and some \u2013 are there some other drivers? And I guess if those numbers are right, it sort of implies gross margins implied in Q1 maybe a little below 70, maybe 69, is that the right kind of level that you are thinking about as the revenue is going to drop here? Jim Mollica : Yes, Stacy, it\u2019s Jim. Let me take that. Let me the margin one first, and then I will talk about the OpEx for the quarter. There is many inputs. There is many levers to the gross margin. There is revenue that\u2019s priced, there is mix as factory loading utilization levels. And let me just try to unpack that a bit. Vince mentioned on the pricing side, basically, that\u2019s stable. So, that\u2019s not a drag to gross margins as we move forward. On the revenue side, basically, we are down \u2013 the midpoint of our first quarter guide on a 13-week basis is down, approaching 30% from our previous peak. So, basically revenue is a headwind for us there. Mix basically is unfavorable as well. As you heard in my prepared remarks, industrial was down 19% and 20% last quarter on a year-over-year and sequential basis, and that will be down again in first quarter. So, mix is a headwind for us. When you put all those puts and takes together, we would expect basically gross margin will fall below 70% in the first half of the year at these trough levels. I think if you think about something in the 68% to 69% range, is probably a good range for this trough revenue range. So, that\u2019s kind of the gross margin. On the OpEx side, as I mentioned, our 4Q OpEx basically was down about $60 million on a sequential basis. This was the combination of reducing discretionary spend and of course, a much lower variable comp. Looking into 1Q, we expect that to be down again even with the extra week. And it\u2019s fair to say that probably you can think about 1% to 2% there. This reduction relates to the actions that we structurally took to reduce OpEx as well as a lower typical seasonal spend in 1Q as well. We don\u2019t guide 2Q, but just to give you a sense there, when you look at 2Q, it\u2019s probably best to compare that to the 4Q, which was a like 13 to 13-week comparison. And when you are looking at 4Q \u201823 versus 2Q \u201824, given some of the structural modest reductions we had made, we would expect OpEx in 2Q to be down a few percent from the 4Q operating levels, so I hope that helps. Stacy Rasgon : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much guys. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks Stacy. I always appreciate your two-part and one-part question. With that, next question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is open. Chris Danely : Hey. Thanks. Just a question on industrial, historically this has been a pretty strong sector for you guys, but it seems like it\u2019s \u2013 the revenue decline in industrial is worse than the overall company. Can you just talk about why that is and maybe broader speaking, are the bookings or the revenue falling more because the macro is worse than expected, or the inventory situation out there is just worse than you guys thought? And do you think you will be able to hold that 70% gross margin floor for the fiscal \u201824? Thanks. Vincent Roche : Yes. Thanks Chris. So, yes look, we have come off a record year for ADI and for the industrial sector. But I would say in the second half of \u201823, we began to see momentum slow on the order side of things. And in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s true to say that weakness in the industrial sector broadened and hit all the various market segments with one exception, the aerospace and defense area. And I think when we look into 2024, given the weaker macro backdrop, and we expect the inventory digestion to continue through the first half particularly at the broad market customers who are suffering most here. So, I think, as Jim said, when we talk about gross margins, the weaker industrial over the first half of the year, that weaker mix, if you like, will impact the gross margins. And for the trough periods here, we are thinking kind of 68%, 69% as reasonable assumptions for gross margin in that period of time. So, it really is, at this point, it\u2019s an adjustment of inventories at our customers and how fast we experience the recovery will determine on the macro. But again, I think it\u2019s true to say, during the first half of this year, we do expect to get this overhang of inventory behind us and get back to a more normalized growth pattern in the second half of the year. Jim, do you want to take a comment? Jim Mollica : Yes. Chris, I think just a couple of points there. Vince talked about at the trough revenue, gross margins in the 68% to 69% range, gross margins at 70% for the year, I think that was the first part of your question as well. A lot of that will depend upon when the demand comes back in terms of \u2013 so we don\u2019t really guide for the year, but that\u2019s probably dependent upon revenue coming back to a more normal level. Let me just add a few points, though. We are \u2013 utilization levels basically brought them down in 4Q, we are going to bring them down again in 1Q. You see the inventory reduction of $70 million in 4Q, which was a little bit better than I think we guided last quarter, you are going to expect that inventory to be reduced at a similar level in 1Q and again in 2Q. And what we are also doing now is we are activating our hybrid manufacturing strategy. So, we are actually swinging wafers from external back in-house, which moderates the factory load, which gives a little bit of a cushion on that gross margin side as well. So, just a little bit more color as what you can expect for us in the second quarter here. Chris Danely : Thanks a lot guys. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks Jim. With that, next question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results in this tough environment. I had a question about CapEx. So, one of your competitors talk about this geopolitical dependable capacity that they are investing in. You are going showed the complete other the way, you are reducing CapEx a lot for this year. Help us understand a little bit what your partners are doing \u2013 your founder partners are doing for you to sort of feel comfortable that you don\u2019t have to spend as much in CapEx going forward? Thank you. Jim Mollica : Thanks Tore. Why don\u2019t we take that in, so I will start. Vincent Roche : I will sort of add some color. Jim Mollica : Yes. So let me just \u2013 let me pause and take a step back on CapEx for a second. So, at our Investor Day, we outlined basically elevated CapEx in the high-single digit range for 2022 and 2023. And then long-term, that would actually trend back down to mid-single digits. As I have said, this past year, CapEx was about $1.2 billion on a gross basis, which is about 10% of sales, which was a bit higher basically due to the revenue fall off that we saw in the second half of the year. This year, as I have said, we are basically slowing our capacity expansion and our CapEx, given kind of the short-term demand that we are actually seeing there. So, from a CapEx viewpoint, we are going to expect that to drop by about $500 million in our FY \u201824. And as I have noted, this figure doesn\u2019t reflect any of the benefit from either the U.S. or European Chips Act. From a capacity viewpoint, what does that mean, that basically means that we will be able to still double our internal capacity footprint by 2025. Originally, we were thinking that was going to take place more in the 2024 time period. But given the macro and the demand outlook, we are comfortable with that. So, we don\u2019t need basically all of that capacity in the short-term. From a customer viewpoint, from a swing capacity viewpoint, our goal is to be able to basically swing 70% of our product portfolio from internal to external fabs. That\u2019s good for our customers because it gives our customers the ability to dual source, and that really creates a rich and resilient supply chain with multiple options for our customers. And from a gross margin viewpoint, internally, that allows us to moderate the factories a bit with this additional swing coming in-house as well. So, we are comfortable with that strategy. I don\u2019t know if Vince has\u2026? Vincent Roche : Yes. So, let me \u2013 good morning, Tore, let me add a couple of piece of color to what Jim has just said. So, most of ADI\u2019s revenue today is built on process technologies that are 180 nanometers [ph] and above. Now in digital technology terms, that\u2019s a very, very old process technology. That\u2019s more than 25-years-old in terms of its currency. But in the analog space, that is still a very contemporary process node, so more than 70 \u2013 a little more than 70% of our revenue today is produced on process technologies at 180 nanometers and above. And as Jim said, we have gone through a major internal expansion to give us more flexibility and agility in terms of where and how we manufacture those process technologies. And we are making all these investments that we have made on the internal fabs of 200-millimeter wafers. So, the tool chains are less expensive, and we are able to get tremendous return on investment over many, many decades on the investments that we are making. So \u2013 and I think below that, for the, let\u2019s say, at the final line geometry nodes, we have very, very good alternatives with our external partners who are in a very, very really important piece of how we make the hybrid manufacturing model work. So, anything that is kind of 90 nanometers and below, it\u2019s 300-millimeter wafers, and we secure that production with multiple sources across the globe. Tore Svanberg : Very helpful. Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks so much Tore. And we will go to our last question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our last question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I had a question on inventory. It sounds like you are planning to bring it down quite a bit from here. And you mentioned that the target is 120 days, but of course, it depends on what the base of revenue is. So, can you quantify how much more you plan to take out of your inventory? It seems like it could come down maybe a couple of hundred million dollars more from here? And then also maybe if you can also quantify \u2013 and this is kind of a hard question to answer, but how much is selling below sell-through? I know you get some metrics, particularly inside of distribution? Thanks. Jim Mollica : Hey Timothy, let me take that. Just to be clear, let me kind of we step that back what I have said. So basically, inventory in fourth quarter was down $70 million, and that was on a quarter-on-quarter compare. That was almost all at the finished goods level. In 1Q, we plan to take inventory down by a similar amount. And then we will do that again in 2Q. That\u2019s on a dollar basis, not on a days basis, just to be clear there. So, over the course of three quarters, fourth quarter and the first half of \u201824, we expect inventory to be down in the $200 million plus range for that. In terms of the channel, as I mentioned, we are \u2013 our sell-in to the channel is lower than our sell-through. And in the fourth quarter, that was \u2013 it was in the $50 million range. And I would probably expect probably a similar number there in first quarter, yes. And with that\u2026 Vincent Roche : Tim and your question on the days of inventory, I would say our pre-COVID target was 120, we are close to 190 today. I think both of them are going to be wrong when all the dust settles, but we will re-up you on kind of the long-term inventory days model at a future call. And with that\u2026 Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Thanks. Vincent Roche : Good Tim. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. Thanks for joining the call. I appreciate your interest in ADI and have a great Thanksgiving. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

When comparing our results to historic performance. Special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2024 was a 14-week quarter.  And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche, Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you very much, Mike, and good morning to you all. But before I begin, I'd like to welcome ADI\u2019s new CFO Richard Puccio to the call, which is only a few weeks in, but we're very excited to have him on board. He brings tremendous financial experience and capability from complex technology sectors, which I think will be very valuable, as we continue to extend our leadership in the Intelligent Edge era. I'd also like to recognize Jim Mollica for serving as Interim CFO and thank Jim for his continued partnership and contributions to our success.  Now on to the results for the first quarter. ADI delivered revenue of more than $2.5 billion, operating margins of 42% and earnings per share of $1.73, all above the midpoint of our outlook. As we previously discussed, the inventory rationalization that our customers that began during the middle of 2023 is expected to continue through our second quarter. Encouragingly, first quarter bookings improved sequentially, growing our confidence that inventory related headwinds will largely subside this quarter. That said, the macro situation remains challenging, and the shape and timing of a second half recovery will be governed by underlying demand.  Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, operational agility, and prudent capital management are serving as well during this downturn. We've invested heavily in R&D, customer engagement, activity and manufacturing resiliency, fueling our future growth, even as we maintain the industry leading profitability that supports our practice of robust capital returns. To that end, I'm pleased to highlight that we announced the 7% dividend increase yesterday, making 2024 the 20th consecutive year of higher dividends for shareholders.  Now, digging a little deeper into our investment philosophy, we continue to focus on anticipating our customers\u2019 future needs. And what's becoming a software-defined AI-driven world leveraging pervasive sensing, Edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity. The technological complexity facing our customers is compounded by their need to deliver solutions that are both secure and extremely power efficient.  So let me share a little more now about how we are strategically allocating our capital to deliver more solutions value to our customers, and further support their confidence in the long-term supply assurance? Since our acquisition of Maxim, we've increased our engineering population by around 10% complementing our world class Analog talent, with increasing levels of digital software, AI, and systems expertise. This breadth of engineering gives ADI the capabilities to tackle more of our customers' challenges, and grow our sell-in across markets.  In addition, as our engineers increasingly work shoulder to shoulder with our customers to co-architect their solutions, we further deepen our understanding of their technological and market complexities. This strengthens our ability to deliver increasingly stronger innovation from components to physical Edge systems.  And I'd like to share now a few examples of what I mean. For example, in the industrial sector, digital transformation is driving investment in Edge-based connectivity and control platforms that enable secure power efficient monitoring and control of automation systems.  Last month, Honeywell announced it will use ADI's Deterministic Ethernet and software-configurable IO solutions across their factory automation and building management offerings. Our portfolio enables customers to securely deliver end-to-end signal integrity between the Edge and the cloud in a power efficient and highly flexible platform configuration. This system approach enables us to capture three times more value, and we expect additional design wins due to high customer interest globally.  In the automotive sector, we've aligned our business to the second are trends of electrification, advanced safety systems, and immersive digital in-cabin experience. For example, our Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link or GMSL Solution continues to gain broader adoption, as customers seek to extend high performance data and video capabilities across their fleets. We\u2019ve recently increased our share at a top three global auto manufacturer extending our position across all their brands and quintupling our GMSL opportunity at that customer.  In datacenters, AI and machine learning computing systems require orders of magnitude more processing and thus energy, compared to traditional workloads. Our portfolio of high-performance power and protection solutions, specifically designed for vertical power delivery is helping customers re-architect their datacenter systems to improve power delivery and system performance. Last quarter, we secured a significant design win from a large hyperscale customer for our multiphase vertical power solution that reduces power losses by 35% when compared to conventional ones. In Healthcare, this market continues to digitalize to enable more predictive and preventative treatment regimens. ADI has been on the forefront of this transition, and I'm pleased to let you know that we've recently received FDA clearance for a non-invasive remote monitoring platform, that enables home-based management of chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure. This solution leverages our deep domain expertise, leading-edge capabilities across signal processing and sensor modalities, and unique algorithms that enable medical providers to act early, precisely and effectively. As a platform, this also allows us in the future to use our data-driven AI algorithms to make this even more personalized. This advance unlocks a new growth vector for ADI, adding more than $5 billion of new sell-in. Switching now to the evolution of our supply chain, I'd like to share some of our progress in manufacturing resilience, which is a growing priority for our customers. Over the last two years, we've invested record levels of CapEx to expand our capacity and to enhance resiliency. Now with line of sight to achieving our goal of doubling front and back-end internal capacity in 2025 and will begin to significantly reduce our capital spend. Notably, approximately 10% of our investments have been focused on implementing more efficient systems that will deliver sustainability benefits, including greatly reducing input resources and emissions, which, overtime, will also lower our operating costs.  These investments enable a more flexible hybrid manufacturing model and will increase our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years. This unique ability helps to capture the upside in strong demand backdrops and better protect our gross margins during more challenging times. Complementing these organic investments, we also extended our foundry partnership with TSMC to secure additional 300-millimeter fine-pitch technology capacity at their Japan subsidiary. Our investments, combined with the support of our foundry partners will enable us to manufacture our products in multiple geographic locations, enhancing our resiliency and giving our customers greater optionality and assurance over their supply chains. So in closing, as always, we're keeping one eye on the present and one eye on the future. I have confidence in the steps that we're taking to preserve our capital and navigate the near term challenges while ensuring that we make the necessary investments to increase our competitiveness and accelerate our business in the future. And so with that, I'd like to pass the microphone over to Rich. Richard Puccio : Thank you, Vince. And let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm excited to have joined ADI and look forward to helping the company navigate the near term while ensuring we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities ahead of us.  Despite continued challenging business conditions, we achieved first quarter revenue, which was slightly above the midpoint of our outlook or down 8% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Industrial represented 48% of revenue in the quarter, down 12% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. As expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as customers continue to work down their inventory levels.  Automotive, which represented 29% of revenue, was up 2% sequentially and 9% versus the year ago period, representing 14 consecutive quarters of growth. Notably our leading connectivity and functionally safe power solutions collectively increased double digits year-over-year. Communications, which represented 12% of revenue, declined 10% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireline fared relatively well driven by AI-related demand, while wireless decreased as global investments in 5G remain depressed.  And lastly, consumer represented 11% of revenue, down 7% sequentially and 22% year-over-year driven by continued sluggish end demand across applications.  Now on to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 69%, down sequentially and year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix lower revenue and lower utilization. OpEx in the quarter was $679 million, down 2% sequentially despite the extra week, driven by lower variable comp, disciplined discretionary spend and structural cost improvement. As a result, operating margin of 42% finished near the high end of our outlook.  Non-operating expenses finished at $75 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. All told, EPS was $1.73, slightly above the guided midpoint. Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and equivalents increased more than $340 million sequentially and ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. Our net leverage ratio remained below 1. Inventory decreased nearly $90 million sequentially, driven primarily by finished goods, while days increased to 201 due to lower revenue. Channel inventory dollars declined again in 1Q with weeks of inventory finishing slightly above our target range of seven to eight weeks. Moving on to cash flow items. Over the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow and CapEx were $4.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 CapEx to be approximately $700 million. As a reminder, these are gross CapEx figures, not including any of the anticipated benefits from both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Over the last 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 28% of revenue. During the same time period, we have returned more than $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases. And since our Maxim acquisition, we have returned nearly $12 billion or more than 130% of free cash flow to shareholders, reducing share count by 8% while also increasing our dividend per share by 33%, including our most recently announced 7% increase.  As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return over the long term. We aim to use 40% to 60% to grow our dividend annually with the remaining free cash flow used for share count reduction. Now moving on to guidance. Second quarter revenue is expected to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, once again, we expect sell through to be higher than sell-in. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to decline sequentially with the largest decline in industrial as we continue to meaningfully reduce channel inventory.  Operating margin is expected to be 37%, plus or minus 100 basis points. This includes the impact of unfavorable mix and lower utilization as we further reduce balance sheet inventory. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%. And based on these inputs, EPS is expected to be $1.26 plus or minus $0.10. In closing, the actions we've taken to protect profitability in the near term as well as the natural shock absorbers embedded in ADI have enabled us to maintain strong profitability even as our quarterly revenue has fallen significantly from its peak. Importantly, with the strength of our financial profile and the growing importance of our technology, we will continue to invest confidently in our future, regardless of where we are in the cycle. I will now give it back to Mike for Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Rich, and welcome to the call. Let\u2019s get into our Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have follow up question, please requeue, and we\u2019ll take your question if time allows. With that, we have our first question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Joseph Moore : Great, thank you. You guys are guiding down now mid-30% year-on-year. If I go back to historic drawdowns, you haven't seen revenue fall that far other than 2001, 2009, where we had kind of significant demand destruction. So it kind of looks like the worst inventory correction maybe we've ever seen. Can you just talk to that? Does that reflect how much inventory excess there might have been? Or just any kind of sense check as we approach the bottom as to why the downturn looks kind of severe? Vincent Roche : Yeah. Thanks, Joe. I think first and foremost, the -- if you like, the events that caused the supply chain fracture was unique. And every single segment was impacted every single customer, every single business. So this is truly the broadest base demand inflection I've ever seen in my 30-something years with ADI. And I've been through all those different perturbations.  So I think that's the uniqueness of the event itself, I think is what caused the level of impact. And we see everything compounded. We saw the supply chain fracture. Then we saw the shortage, and then we got the behavior that we typically see in a shortage situation. You get double ordering, you get holding. And we're seeing that everywhere. The area that we've probably seen, I would say, the biggest correction is in the industrial market. And I think our sense is that it began in the second -- kind of the second half of the past year. And that will take four to five quarters to correct, I believe, from the beginning of the decline to when we start to see growth again. So I think that's pretty much it. But now we're in a situation where the lead times are very uniform. And actually, we got ahead of the supply chain issues, I think, faster than most. We've got our lead times back into better shape than most quite quickly. And so we saw the downturn, I think, more quickly than others. So all that said, Joe, I think the underlying demand for our products and technologies in the years ahead. We remain very, very bullish about that. And I expect, as we've indicated that we'll see a return back to growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Joe. Operator, next question please? Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. You may proceed. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Rich, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the segment guidance next quarter. I know you said everything down in industrial worse. But I mean like industrial has got to be down probably more than 20% sequentially, and that would probably still assume everything else is down double digit sequentially. Is that what you have in mind? And any further color you could give us would be great. Michael Lucarelli : Yeah. I'll grab that one. It's Mike. So you're right to think industrial is the weakest. I would say, 20% sequentially, sure, you can put that number in your model if you want to, 20% plus or minus sequentially.  I would say comms is also probably worse in the midpoint of your guidance, so down more than the 16% we guided to. While auto and consumer probably do a bit better, but are both down pretty significantly sequentially as well. And really, the big driver on the industrial piece, as we laid out is the channel reduction in the -- for the inventory in the channel, which is impacting industrial more so in other markets. I hope that helps, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : Yeah. Michael Lucarelli : We\u2019ll go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. You may proceed. Chris Danely : Hey, thanks, guys. Just to follow up on that question. How much of this downturn do you think is just pure inventory correction versus demand? And then any comments you could you could have on just demand trends as far as what you're hearing from the distribution channel and your customers? Michael Lucarelli : Sure. I'll start and then I think Vince will add some clarity also on it, but this really is a supply-driven demand correction, what you're seeing here. And Vince outlined that in the answer to the first question where the supply chain fracture lead times extended for an extended period of time. Those have normalized.  We're still seeing what are happening as our customers is, they build a lot of inventory over that time. Why our lead times are extremely long. Now our lead time is back to normal, so they're seeing them reduce their balance sheet inventory to match our short lead times, so the cycle times match up. So really also a majority supply chain some demand. There's some areas of pockets of weakness in demand. But really overall, I'll call it more of a supply than demand correction in our business.  And we talked about in the script and as well the press release that supplied normalizing here in our second quarter. Vincent Roche : Yeah. I think, Chris, if we look at the two halves of FY24, I believe the first half is all about inventory in digestion and digestion. And as Mike said, we largely get through that part of the headwind by the end of our second quarter. And then in the second half, all the indications our bookings are getting stronger, cancellations are abating. Our conversations with customers suggest that we'll begin to return to a growth pattern in the second half.  The big question is the macroeconomic dial where that's positioned. And I think at the margins, if I look at where we are this quarter versus last quarter, at least from a macro standpoint, maybe with the exception of China, we're more bullish than we were. Chris Danely : All right. Thanks, guys. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. You may proceed. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Vince, on the last earnings call, you mentioned bookings were stabilizing. I think this quarter, you're saying bookings are improving. And I'm curious which end markets are showing the best recovery in bookings? And then importantly, how should this inform us about what ADI will see as we get into the July quarter? Should we be assuming some kind of seasonal recovery, should we assume things flatten out first?  And if I could attach kind of part B of that, which is what happens to gross margins as you start to see that flattening out and potential recovery? So just the shape of what recovery looks like in sales and margins if bookings flatten and now they seem to be improving? Vincent Roche : Yeah. Well, I think, look, as soon as demand in flex, and we get back into a more normalized growth pattern, Vivek, everything will improve. Our utilizations will improve. We have under-shipped the channel, we've under-shipped our customers. So we've been working very, very hard in the company to make sure that when demand and flex that we will get a -- we've got the supply in place. We've got lots of finished goods and deadstock inventory. So we're in a great position to address the recovery. On the first part of your question about where are we seeing the bookings improvement, pretty much everywhere, pretty much everywhere, across all the segments. And if you look at industrial, I'd say the two healthiest parts of industrial right now is, as we message to the external world, aerospace and defense and healthcare, they've got fundamentally quite different drivers to, say, the factory automation or instrumentation business. But those two sectors are holding up better than the rest. But even in a more traditional industrial sector like instrumentation, all of these new high-performance computing systems need you test equipment, so that benefits ADI. So I think, in general, it's true to say, maybe with the exception of our wireless business, most sectors are seeing a return to a more normalized bookings pattern. Richard Puccio : And Vivek, I'll give you a little more color on the gross margin outlook. So in the last call, we talked about gross margin will be 68% to 69%. We came in at the high end, a good result given the large drop in industrial that we've been talking about and with an inventory takedown of almost $90 million quarter-over-quarter.  The 2Q outlook implies 67% plus or minus, a bit lower than what we thought would be given the weaker revenue, especially in industrial and the fact that we're taking down factory starts further in 2Q to reduce inventory by another $50 million to $100 million. And if I think a little bit further out to the half two outlook, tough to predict right now is the revenue and the shape of the revenue recovery will be the governor on gross margin trajectory. But our best sense is gross margin trends higher in the second half, as we don't see utilization going much lower as inventory continues to decline meaningfully at these start levels and we'll continue to leverage our swing capacity. Michael Lucarelli : And Vivek, as you asked a three-part question, I'll chime in as well for third quarter outlook. I know you gave me the outlook question. So it's hard to say, right? Our lead times are 13 weeks are lower. So we don't really have visibility into the third quarter today. But if you look back over history over the past decade, our B2B markets are about flattish sequentially in 3Q from 2Q, sometimes they're up a little bit, sometimes they're down a little bit depending where you are in the cycle, while consumers start seeing some holiday builds kind of up mid- to high single digit sequentially. So that's kind of historical context. We're not guiding in the third quarter, but that's how we should frame it. And then to add on to what Vince said about bookings. Bookings actually increased last quarter, and the quarter before that. So 4Q and 1Q bookings both improved. And what's interesting now is you look at our bookings, they're approaching parity, which is a good sign that we just see a pickup in the back half of the year. Vivek Arya : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Harlan Sur : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So if I look at fiscal '23, China was about 18% of your total revenues. It was the worst performing geography down about 13% for the full year. Because Lunar New Year was so late this year, it feels like this did add a little bit of uncertainty at the beginning of this year, but obviously, now we're post-Lunar New Year. What are the demand signs out of this region? Are orders also growing sequentially in the China regions? Are cancellations also showing signs of stabilization patterns as well? Maybe even signs of a potential pickup in the China region? Just want to get your views. Michael Lucarelli : So if you take a step back from a geo perspective, whole regions are weak, North America, Europe, China. China has been weakest the longest, I would say. The rest of Asia is doing better than the big three, but still weak as well. And like I said, China is the weakest source of demand.  Around Chinese New Year, honestly, if there's something unique about it, we called out. But I think what Vince said in the last question basically was bookings are improving globally as well as in China before and after this year. So really no impact from Chinese New Year and kind of the commentary we've made. Harlan Sur : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Toshiya Hari : Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Vince, I'm curious how you would characterize sell-through today versus sell-in. I think at a conference a couple of months ago, you had mentioned that sell-in was tracking 15% to 20% below sell-through. Is that still the right ballpark number? And is that what you're seeing in the current quarter? And I guess, if so, if the end demand environment doesn't deteriorate over the next six, nine months? Could there be a quarter later in the year where your revenue run rate is tracking above $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion? Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : I'll grab the first part of that on the sell-in and sell-through part of it, Toshi. So selling and sell-through really relates to the channel. We reduced our channel inventory dollars the past two quarters, I would call it around a $50 million reduction, plus or minus per quarter over the last two quarters.  Looking at embedded in our guidance is a much bigger reduction of channel inventory. If you want to put a number around $100 million or so in our outlook, that's probably what we're seeing on the channel side. So we're reducing a lot in the channel.  Now as you look at the back half of the year, from a channel perspective, we think the sell-in and sell-through should be better matched given the actions we've taken over the last three quarters. And I'll pass it to Vince to talk a little about the customer inventory situation on the end customer side. Vincent Roche : Yeah. On the customer side of things, we've been monitoring very, very carefully across the various segments. Our customer shipment rates, their inventories and their ADI goods on hand. And we're clearly under-shipping our customers' current demands. So we feel that we've got a situation now in terms of our -- we're in a good inventory position on hand. Our customers are beginning, as Mike indicated, to replenish their order books, ADI's goods.  And that gives us the confidence as the book-to-bill approaches unity that we're seeing the worst of the inventory correction. And in the second half, we will get back to a more normalized growth pattern. So as Mike said, there's a very good balance between the direct channel, the distribution channel in terms of the inventory situation, but we're ready for the upsurge. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities. You may proceed. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to welcome, Rich, but direct a couple of questions to Vince, please. Vince, the more vertical capabilities that you talked about, it sort of suggests that you're needing to either partner more closely with a smaller number of customers or maybe you wind up pushing somewhat into their capabilities and are potentially competing with some of them. And I wonder how you contemplate managing that dynamic? Vincent Roche : Yeah. Will, thanks very much. You're -- unfortunately, the line shopped. I think I got your question about verticalization, competing with our customers potentially. Hopefully, you can hear me, okay, that it's not a two-way line problem here. Will, look, the -- we've been on a journey over many, many years now to continue to build out our core component franchise, but also add more value to our solutions.  Our business has become more solutions-oriented particularly over the last decade in every single segment that we play. And that kind of domain application-driven engineering that ADI has been distinguishing it so at the edge over the last decade, that will continue, and we're continuing to build that. I talked on the -- in the prepared remarks about this point of care, acute health care solution that we've just brought to market where we've got an FDA approval. I think what's happening, Will, in the world is that there are certain places like that where we have a white space to attack. We're building a complete solution that has both hardware and software makes a lot of sense. But the truth is, even in the traditional markets and with the larger customers that we deal with, more and more footprint capture, if you like, has been taking place. Why? Because we tame our customers' complexity. And I've talked before about the asymmetry and capabilities in the Analog space between the capabilities ADI has got and our customers have got. They expect us actually to add more solution value and build more complete solutions and clearly define where the line is between where their core value is versus where ADI's core values. So I think we're not competing with our customers, but we have very vibrant discussions about where we draw the line of the labor divide, so to speak. William Stein : That helps. If I can ask a follow-up. You talked a bit about AI. It's sort of a familiar topic to us lately. Maybe too much so. Vincent Roche : Not much. William Stein : There's a narrative here where there are some creative capabilities, in fact, I would say, engineering-focused capabilities that maybe made more efficient or productive with Generative AI. In a world where the story about Analog design engineer capability being so limited and that driving a significant advantage for ADI. I wonder if that story changes at all because of this capability. Have you started using this for circuit design? Or do you anticipate that it could be used by others, either competitors or customers? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yeah, it's a good question. Well, look, everybody is trying to figure out the meaning of the AI in their businesses. We're using AI today in our tool chains. We're using machine learning and AI in our products, around our products. We're starting to use it in our business. And I think -- I believe that anything that can be -- anything that is routine -- and that can be automated, that's the way of technology. Technology automation will take over the things that are more routine. We play very much at the high end of the performance spectrum. So unless there's generative intelligence that can outperform our imaginations, which I don't see any time in the foreseeable future. We're truly in a realm where the intellectual property value and the learning system that we've got in this company will matter more and more. But yeah, I think we view AI as a tremendous opportunity. As clearly in the product development process from how the products are designed, what we put as ingredients in our products, and we're also, by the way, putting AI into the customer support tool chain. So it is a part. We're embracing it, and we believe that it will be an accelerator and the copilot, if you like, with our engineering population. William Stein : Thank you. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Will, it sounds like from your cell phone line, we do need some more 5G coverage. So next question, please? Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You may proceed. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thanks a lot. Can you talk to any period costs versus underutilization charges that you're taking? And any of those -- how much of a headwind are those now? And how much will those help you as they might reverse themselves coming out of the downturn? Thanks. Michael Lucarelli : So I think your question is on how much of the impact on our gross margins underutilization versus mix. I think if you look here, our peak gross margins were about 74%. Our outlook, as Rich pointed out, embeds about 67%. That decline is really mix and utilization, about equal parts, I'll call it.  As you look to the back half of this year, it depends what mix is going to do. I think industrial is bottoming here, so that should help a little bit. From a utilization standpoint, Rich also pointed out, our starts are low enough to reduce inventory meaningfully. We've been doing that. We'll do it again in 2Q. So I don't see it starts going down, they're probably start going up, which should provide a tailwind to gross margins. How fast the gross margins pick up really depends on those 2 factors, how fast the revenue picks up and how much of it relates to the industrial sector. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, Mike. But I guess, are there any inventory charges? That's the question. Michael Lucarelli : So from inventories, yeah, I would say, a good question. You're right. We have a lot of inventory. As you can see on our balance sheet. The -- there's no acceleration of inventory charges in our gross margins. The inventory charge from a reserve standpoint have been elevated for the past few quarters, and they probably stay that way as you go into the back half of this year into next year. But that's not a headwind anymore. It's already kind of built in the run rate. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, awesome. Thanks, Mike. Michael Lucarelli : We will go to our last question, please. Operator : One moment for our last question. And our last question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed. CJ Muse : Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. You talked about auto being down sequentially, but seeing, I guess, the best performance out of all the different segments. Curious if you can kind of walk through what you're seeing from Tier 1 auto correction and whether you think that will be completed exiting April as well? Thanks so much. Michael Lucarelli : Yeah. Sure. From the auto standpoint, C.J., I would say, yes, there is definitely an inventory correction going on in auto like or market as Vince pointed that out, the supply fracture at everyone is, to a lesser degree, than auto than other markets, but it's not really because of the inventory. It's because of the growth drivers in that business, whether it's BMS, GMSL AB functional safe power, the growth in those areas are offsetting the overall call it inventory digestion in automotive area.  You're right to say that on the Tier 1 side or the OEM side, there's some froth inventory. But we're seeing that being digested. Will it be all complete? By the second quarter, we'll see, but I do feel good about those growth areas continue to grow this year. And for the full year, will auto grow, I don't know. We'll see. But it really depends on how strong the growth is in the growth areas and how much of the overhang on the inventory side is. But net-net, we do feel good about auto being our best performing end market here in 2Q and for the full year '24. Vincent Roche : All right. Thank you, CJ. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on the website. Thanks for joining us, and have a great rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you, Judy. And good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. With me on the call today, ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Richard Puccio. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it in relating financial schedules and investor.analog.com. Onto the disclosures, information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our periodic reports and other materials follow the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information, as these statements reflect our expectations only as a date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update the statements except as required by law. Revenue, adjusted gross margin, operating and non-operating expenses, operating margin, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow in our comment today will be on non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to historic performance. Special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince? Vincent Roche : Thank you very much, Mike. Good morning, and a big welcome to you all. In the second quarter, a strong focus execution resulted in revenue of $2.16 billion, with profitability and earnings per share finishing above the high-end of our outlook. With 2Q now behind us, we believe, we've passed the low point of this cycle. Notably, global manufacturing PMIs, which are highly correlated with our core business are improving, customer inventories are stabilizing and our bookings have improved for a third consecutive quarter. Our growing optimism remains guarded, however, as short-term economic and geopolitical uncertainty persists. As such, we will continue to manage the near-term with great discipline, as we fund and execute against our longer-term strategic priorities to drive increasing levels of value for all of our stakeholders. With that framing, I'd like to share some examples with you of how we are continuing to strengthen ADI's high performance franchise across all markets and creating unique growth drivers that will be additive to what we hope will be a strong cyclical recovery. For example, in healthcare, we have exciting wins in areas such as the rapidly expanding surgical robotics market, where the performance of our precision signal processing and connectivity solutions is critical. In the fast growing, continuous glucose monitoring space, we've won multiple opportunities across several customers. Our unique digitally enabled analog front end solutions increase the accuracy and power efficiency of sensors and extend battery life from days to weeks. In industrial automation, the growth of the digital factory is accelerating upgrades to higher bandwidth, deterministic industrial Ethernet that can support up to 10x the number of edge devices across the factory floor. We believe our leadership position with key customers will create a durable revenue stream, beginning next year that can grow to several hundreds of millions of dollars as deployments ramp over time. Turning to automotive. Our solid performance is being driven by the proliferation of higher content vehicles that use more power management, more connectivity and an increasing number of sensor platforms that open new signal processing opportunities for ADI. The increasing content per vehicle is a pervasive trend across all vehicle types\u2019 combustion engines, hybrids and full EVs. For example, in advanced safety, we've increased our GMSL design wins from 12 to 15 of the top 20 OEMs, and expanded our engagements at two European and one Korean OEM, who intend to deploy our high performance, high bandwidth connectivity solution across a larger share of their fleets. We've also seen strong attach for functionally safe power, which is used with sensors and displays in ADAS systems and recently increased share at the leading global car manufacturer. In electrification, we've expanded our battery management system share at leading Chinese OEMs and more than doubled our BMS share in upcoming European OEM model launches, and two manufacturers intend to deploy our higher content wireless solutions starting next year. Now I'd like to use the rest of my prepared comments today to share our perspective on the role that artificial intelligence is playing and will play at ADI in the future. This technology has clearly reached a tipping point and our AI opportunity spans from sensor to cloud. While we've been adding algorithmic and software intelligence to our products now for decades, we've expanded the scope and pace of our investments in recent years. Today, we are increasingly leveraging AI in and around our products, as well as in our operations to more fully meet our customers' needs and extend our industry leadership. We're deploying AI internally to help to accelerate engineering development, enhance manufacturing efficiency and create a better customer experience. But the majority of our activities are centered around product portfolio innovations that position us to take advantage of AI's enormous potential. We see this business opportunity coming in two distinct waves. The first wave focused on infrastructure is now underway and as we all know is growing very rapidly. In order to tackle the intensified energy and processing demands of AI compute systems, data center customers are investing in new vertical power architectures. As we highlighted previously, our vertical power technology, which can reduce power losses by up to 35% compared to existing architectures is gaining traction with hyperscalers. We continue to leverage our heterogeneous integration expertise to create more efficient, smaller vertical power solutions that deliver more value and enable us to capture more share in this nascent space. Power efficient computing though is just one challenge the AI ecosystem faces. Data must also be transported efficiently, securely and at much, much greater speeds. This is driving wireline customers to upgrade connectivity infrastructure, sparking a transition to 800 gigabit and 1.6 terabit optical modules. At the electro optical interface, our ability to provide high performance solutions that integrate analog, digital and memory in a reduced form factor is indeed a key differentiator. Our high precision controller was recently designed into a 1.6 terabit optical module used in the next gen AI systems of the high performance compute leader. In industrial, AI is fueling extraordinary demand for high bandwidth memory and high performance compute. This in turn is driving a new growth vector for our instrumentation and test business, particularly in SoC and memory test. We are working with key players globally to enable faster digital scan speeds, higher channel density and the improved energy efficiency necessary to scale production of AI systems. The significantly greater amount of ADI content in these systems is positioning our high performance compute and memory test sectors for record revenues in the near to mid-term. The opportunity ahead for ADI is to compound the impact of this first wave by bringing application-specific AI models and high performance compute right down to the physical edge, creating greater system value with added improvements in latency, power efficiency, security and cost. Let me share some examples of how we are working to amplify the second wave. For example, in acoustic systems, we are combining our application specific algorithms with ultra-low energy processing hardware to enrich our audio platform offerings. We are also developing a mixed signal processor with embedded neural networks that enable a system to learn and adapt to the highly variable nature of sound in real time. Excitingly, we have strong traction with multiple customers in this area. Now in the same vein, we're leveraging our rich domain expertise with our growing processing capabilities to enhance our advanced connectivity platform in next generation 5G radios. For example, we've implemented the first AI enabled technology, combining an energy efficient real time neural network with an AI assisted development tool to give customers the ability to solve their linearization challenges in a fraction of the time. In our power management platform, we're using AI to address the arduous challenge of tuning power trees for volatile consumption patterns in data centers. Our solutions reduce complexity for power engineers and compress the time required from weeks to hours, helping to lower costs, and of course, accelerate time to market. The ADI is always operated at the physical edge, where the world's most important real data is born. As multimodal AI becomes more pervasive at the edge and a diversity of sensor types is used to unearth deeper insights, we expect to see an explosion of demand that will accelerate growth for our broad signal chain, as well as power portfolios. In short, ADI's AI future looks bright across the continuum of sensor to cloud. In closing, I'm very proud of how our team has executed in one of the largest downturns the semiconductor industry has seen. More importantly, I've never been more excited about how we are positioned for the future and what it holds for ADI. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Rich. Richard Puccio : Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, our first quarter 2024 was a 14 week quarter, so we are going to limit our comparisons this quarter to year-over-year only. Second quarter revenue of $2.16 billion finished above the midpoint of our outlook. This result was down 34% year-over-year. Industrial represented 47% of revenue in the quarter and was down 44% year-over-year. As expected, all applications were impacted by inventory digestion. However, aerospace and defense revenues outperformed broader industrial. Automotive represented 30% of revenue and was down 10% year-over-year. Continued growth in our leading connectivity and functionally safe power franchises balanced broad-based declines elsewhere. Communications represented 11% of revenue and was down 45% year-over-year. Inventory digestion and weaker demand impacted both our wireline and wireless businesses. Lastly, consumer represented 11% of revenue and was down 9% year-over-year with growth in portables, partially offsetting declines across other applications. Now let's move from the top-line to the rest of the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 66.7%, down sequentially and year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix, lower revenue and lower utilization as we continue to reduce inventory. Operating expenses in the quarter were $598 million, down significantly year-over-year, driven by lower variable compensation and strong organization wide execution on cost control. Operating margin of 39% exceeded the high end of our outlook. Non-operating expenses finished at $64 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%. The net result was EPS of $1.40 above the high end of our outlook. Our financial position is solid, and I'd like to call out a few items from our balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q2 with more than $2.3 billion of cash and short-term investments and a net leverage ratio of 1.1. During the quarter, we raised $1.1 billion of debt for general corporate purposes, including upcoming debt maturities. Inventory decreased $74 million sequentially, and days declined to 192 from 201. As planned, we have reduced channel inventory this quarter with weeks ending at approximately eight. Operating cash flow for the quarter and trailing 12 months was $0.8 billion and $4.3 billion respectively. CapEx for the quarter and trailing 12 months was $188 million and $1.2 billion respectively. We continue to expect fiscal '24 CapEx to be roughly $700 million, which is a reduction of approximately 45% versus 2023, as our hybrid manufacturing investment cycle tapers. Not included in these figures are the benefits from both the European and U.S. CHIPS acts. During the last 12 months, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow or 29% of revenue. Over the same time period, we have returned roughly 110% of our free cash flow via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our policy is to return 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders over the long-term. Now I'll turn to the third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.27 billion plus or minus $100 million, up 5% sequentially at the midpoint. Once again, we expect sell through to be higher than sell in. At the midpoint, we expect all B2B markets to increase sequentially with the fastest growth in industrial, and for consumer to exhibit seasonal strength. Operating margin is expected to be 40% plus or minus 100 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% 13%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.50 plus or minus $0.10. Before passing it back to Mike to begin Q&A, I'll share some final thoughts on our near-term. As Vince indicated, we believe we are at the beginning of a cyclical recovery as our bookings increased throughout the quarter and we exited 2Q with a book-to-bill above parity for the first time in well over a year. No doubt cyclical transitions can be challenging, but they also provide opportunity for outsized business acceleration when approached with a balance of fiscal discipline, smart risk taking and strong execution. ADI has always excelled in these areas and we look forward to driving outstanding value for our stakeholders in the quarters to come. With that, I'll pass it back to Mike for Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Rich. Let's get to the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question, please re-queue and we'll take your question if time allows. With that, we will have our first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on finding the recovery here. I had a question about the outlook for Q3, specifically in Industrial. I think you indicated that, you expect Industrial to be the strongest performer this quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what's behind that strength between end market demands, inventory replenishment and if there's any sub-segments within industrial that's driving that outperforming growth? Richard Puccio : Sure, Tore. This is Rich, and I'll take that one. Industrial obviously is our most diversified and profitable end market, and it's weathered an unprecedented broad-based inventory correction over the past year. Importantly, we expect Q2 was the bottom for industrial and it will grow in the second half starting here in 3Q. Stronger PMIs are supporting the broad-based bookings we've seen for the three consecutive quarters now. As mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are planning to reduce channel inventory further in Q3, which impacts industrial more than any other market. This will be more than a year of under shipping consumptions, one reason we believe inventory headwinds have stabilized for industrial. Given these dynamics and the exciting design wins and AI related tailwinds in our instrumentation and test business, which Vince alluded to, we feel strongly we are at the beginning of the industrial recovery. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think one other piece of color, Tore, is that, the obviously, the aerospace and defense business is doing well. We've a lot of high prospects for that over the coming years. But I think, in general, geographically, it's been on the upward in terms of demand and across most of the segments, and particularly the ones that Rich pointed out. Michael Lucarelli : Tore, on the outlook comment, you're right. Just to clarify what we said, of the B2B markets, industrial grow the fastest, consumer will grow faster than industrial in 3Q. If you want to just kind of back it down a little bit, consumer is probably growing about 10% sequentially and industrial is probably closer to mid-single-digits and the other two markets are probably a little bit below that industrial level, but all markets should grow in 3Q. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the book-to-bill. It's above one. Is it above one in all the segments, or is it just above one in industrial? Michael Lucarelli : Yes, sure. It's actually good question. It's above one in all end markets. Not all applications within end markets are above one though. And if you think about the shape of that bookings throughout the quarter, we talked about last earnings call, bookings improved. It started below parity and exit the quarter above parity and that's across all markets and geographies. But again, I reiterate, it's not all applications and we talked a little bit about on the last question about what applications are above one. You can think of some instrumentation, some automation, some aerospace and defense within industrial. Broad-based improvement in bookings across all market geographies is really the main takeaway. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the back half of the calendar year and how you're thinking about the shape of the recovery. Vince, you've lived through many cycles. I think typically the same way we underestimate the magnitude of the pace of the downturn, we collectively underestimate the pace of the upturn. I'm curious if you expect this upturn to be similar to past cycles and we kind of follow those patterns or do you see anything in the marketplace today or anything from customers that would indicate something materially different in terms of the shape of the upturn? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Thanks, Toshiya. Look, first off, we believe we've seen the bottom of the cycle. As Mike indicated, the stronger PMIs that we've seen, particularly in the industrial sector, give us a lot of confidence, and there's a strong correlation between our industrial business, which is about half of the company's total revenue. As we've said now a few times, bookings and backlog coverage for the next several months beyond this quarter would give us strong indications that we expect continued growth during the second half of the year. I'll also point out, I think for 2025, we will have a brisk growth year, that's my sense. We are asked all the time, what's the shape going to be? I don't really know what the exact shape is going to be, but I think we're on the upward trajectory. We have confidence in that across the board. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Vince, what is the right way to understand the true change in end demand, if we set aside all the inventory fluctuations? For example, is it worthwhile seeing what the distribution sell through do year-on-year in Q2? What is the assumption for Q3? Does that inform us in any way about can Q4 be seasonal, whatever is the version of seasonality? I'm just trying to see, the right apples-to-apples way of looking at what is end demand doing, setting aside all this inventory noise. Vincent Roche : Yes. Look, I think it's very hard to answer that question, simply because when history is written, we're going to get the average of what's happened pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. There's been so much ringing in the system, demand overshoot and then demand undershoot. But my sense is, certainly from our perspective, I think we are very well-positioned to be able to capture the upside if things grow faster than we expect. We have got a lot of inventory on the balance sheet. We've kept inventory closer to ADI less downstream. We've got as well a tailwind here from AI, which I think is going to be a multi-year tailwind. We have got that pushing us along. But at the same time, still we've got high interest rates, we've got still relatively high inflation in many places. I think ultimately the size of the recovery and the pace of the recovery will have a strong economic and geopolitical tone to it. But, overall, my sense is, we'll see good growth for the remainder of this year and strong growth in 2025. Beyond that, I think we've got many, many growth drivers that we feel very confident about. We're selling more value into each of our customers and each of our segments. I feel good about the place that semis are in as an industry right now as well in terms of overall demand, as the edge becomes more intelligent and the cloud builds out. But very, very hard to give you an answer on the puts and takes. I mean, the dynamics of the relatively near-term are hard to decode. But what we can tell you is, given where PMIs are at, given where our demand is at, we are in a recovery phase. Richard Puccio : Vince, I would add to that. While it's impossible to get perfect visibility into our end customer inventory, certainly the signals that we monitor tell us that, customer inventories are much healthier than they were previously as we enter the second half. This is also aided by our belief that, we have been under shipping under consumption for over a year now both in the channel and direct. Vivek Arya : But that's Quantification, right, of what the sell through has been in the reported quarters year-on-year? Vincent Roche : Yes. I can help you out there, Vivek. I think your question is kind of what sell in versus sell through. We talked about last year. We talked about reducing the channel inventory by about $100 million. We achieved that in our 2Q. We actually did a little better than that. As you look to 3Q, we'll reduce channel dollars again, but not by that much, not nearly $100 million, much less than $100 million. So, we're getting more normal in the channel as our weeks are coming down into our target range. That normalization is helping some of the growth, but sell through is also increasing in 3Q from 2Q, which is really how we drive the business and look at for indication. As you fast forward to 4Q, if these bookings continue, we don't know. There's no reason to think we won't be more in balance in 4Q from a ship in versus ship out perspective as well, and then we'll see how 1Q goes from there. I think that's kind of the question you're asking is, there's piece Rich talked about and Vince talked about the customer's inventory that's leading out. If you look at us and what we're shipping in the channel that's also normalizing setting us up for a good second half in 2025. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danley from Citigroup. Christopher Danley : Can you talk about the gross margin drivers from here? Maybe touch on utilization rates and inventory trends and some of your competitors have talked about pricing returning to historical norms. If that happens, can you still get the gross margins back to the previous peak? Richard Puccio : Sure. I'll take that one. From a gross margin and utilization perspective, we talked a little bit about this in the first quarter call. We expect both utilization and gross margin bottomed in our Q2. However, we do expect the pace of gross margin expansion in the second half to be modest. Specifically for Q3, we anticipate gross margin a bit above 67%. Looking from here, gross margins expansion is going to be dictated by continued revenue growth, mix of business and utilization. From a balance sheet perspective, since our peak in Q3, we've reduced balance sheet inventory significantly, including over $70 million in Q2. For the third quarter, we expect to reduce inventory again by a lesser amount than in Q2. Overall, we executed pretty strongly against our inventory reduction goals, while mitigating the impact on gross margin, leveraging our dynamic hybrid manufacturing model. One of the things that's been super helpful in protecting us in this trough is the flexibility to swing capacity back into our fabs to help to maintain utilization. We've done that effectively, which is why we called the floor on utilization. I expect that utilizations as the demand continues to increase will start to increase and aid in our margin expansion. From a channel, as Mike mentioned, from a channel perspective, our goal was to reduce by $100 million we achieved. We will reduce an additional amount in Q3 to a lesser degree. Ultimately, we expect that this will get us firmly back into our target range of seven to eight weeks of inventory in the channel. Vincent Roche : Let me make a comment on the pricing side of things. Across the portfolio, our pricing has been very, very stable and I expect that to continue. Our products are very sticky. The franchise is very, very diversified. It's got lots of long life products in it. We tend to hang on to our sockets for, I think, on an average more than a decade. Clearly, where the competition is for the new sockets. But ADI has the premier innovation system in the analog mixed signal space and we have been pushing that innovation. While others are focused on volume, we're focused on value. I think it's a very, very different approach to things. We are not a commodity supplier at all. So we are not immune to price pressure, but we are more protected I think and we have better meat because of the innovation that we generate. I'll note as well, our ASPs are more than 4x the average. It's our innovation premium that enables us as well to capture more value and to produce the kind of gross margins that that we do. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Congrats on marking the trough and turning the corner. Vince, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question. I think it's been four years since you guys bought Maxim and I believe it was four years prior to that with Linear. How are you looking at the M&A environment? Are there any kind of pieces to the puzzle that you wish you had? Vincent Roche : Thanks, Ross. We've always acquired assets that get ADI ahead of customers' needs. We tend to take a long-term view, get ahead of our customers' needs. Obviously, we've been very, very selective. I will say, Ross, it's fair to say that, in terms of scale and scope of analog high performance franchise, we are where we need to be. Analog mixed signal power, we've got a wonderful power franchise now. But we've been adding, I alluded in my remarks or stated in my prepared remarks that, we have been putting more software content, more digital content and we've also been for about seven or eight years now developing machine learning, neural networking capability. Those are areas where as the world becomes more and more software defined, that is clearly an area where ADI has been organically investing. We've done some more tuck-in type acquisitions as well that help us in that area. But I think right now, we are really focused on making sure that, we fully capture all the synergies, from the revenue synergies from Maxim. But we're always looking, by the way. We're always looking for assets. But clearly I think analog is complete and it's other areas we're now looking. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Evercore ISI. Mark Lipacis : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Vince, it's for you, I think. If you look at your -- if you adjust your revenues for the step function increase that you had for pricing, it looks like on a unit basis, you're shipping 25% below the trend line. I don't think you shipped that far below your long-term trend line since the world financial crisis. At the same time that's happening, you talked about your customers lowering, the supply chain lowering inventories, you are lowering inventories. It seems like there's a real risk that the industry is setting up for you and the industry is setting up for like a really tight supply environment, maybe even as they're early as the end of this year or early next year. I'm wondering, how do you think is there a risk that we enter that kind of a scenario? It seems like your customers never learn about trying to get their inventories right and the order see you on time. Is there something that's changed in your operations that will enable you to adjust to that, what has historically happened, which is your customers overshoot on the downside on their inventories and then come in at the last second when things are really tight? Vincent Roche : Yes. Well, yes, I think surging demand is a problem of a high quality. And as -- we have virtually 200 days of inventory in our balance sheet, stage primarily at the die socket level. So that gives us a tremendous amount of output that we could bring within weeks to the market. It's a question of packaging and test to a first approximation. Obviously, we're carrying finished goods as well. We have also spent $2.5 billion plus on making sure that we have internal capacity in our 4 internal fabs to be able to meet the demands across the nodes that produce most of the revenue for ADI. We've got great partners, partners like TSMC, for example, who are a critical part of our hybrid manufacturing model. So I think in terms of the ability to be able to address a really short order snapback is good, just given the coverage that we've got with internal inventories. Our distributors are carrying virtually 8 weeks as well as inventory. And then we've got all this new capacity. We've more than doubled the internal capacity on the critical nodes that address every single market that we that we participate in. So I think in terms of manufacturing agility, inventories, we're in good shape. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Great job on the quarterly execution. Within your distribution business, it's about 60% of your overall revenues. You can monitor sell-through in near real-time which allows the team to tightly control the inventories into this channel. On the direct business, less visibility on consumption levels of inventory here. I think direct customer orders to you are probably the best indicator of where they are in terms of their inventory targets. So is the return to quarter-on-quarter growth in July and second half optimism on growth being driven by order growth at direct customers as well? And then just any qualitative differences on the residual excess inventory distri versus direct? Michael Lucarelli : Yes, Harlan, it's Mike. Yes, the direct order we talked about our -- direct orders as well as channel orders, but what's driving the growth is direct sales, out of the channel on a sell-through basis as well imaged directly to our end customers. So yes, it's not about -- we're not growing because the channel is refilling. We're growing because there's real demand out there on the end market level across all of our markets. Richard Puccio : We expect to reduce both balance sheet and channel inventory further in Q3 while growing. Michael Lucarelli : Did that [indiscernible] to your question, Harlan? Harlan Sur : Yes, it does. Michael Lucarelli : We'll go to our last question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Great. I wanted to also touch on your margin profile. You used to peak with operating margins in kind of the low 40s. And now you're -- as you said you would, in a very difficult trough, you're troughing for the full year, probably above 40%. So that's pretty good structural improvement. Can you talk about that, what's going on if you sort of look over a decade, why is your through-cycle margin profile going up so much? Richard Puccio : Yes. So I think a couple of things, right? As we talked about -- the resiliency of our manufacturing process allows us to swing capacity in and out which allows us to offset some of the down cycle pressure on margins because we're able to keep utilization at a higher level given that swing capacity. Obviously, we continue to look for productivity and are executing on productivity improvements across all of our internal fabs. So I think that helps. And then if you think at an overall operating margin perspective, we've been demonstrating and we'll continue to demonstrate pretty strong operational control over expenses. Look, we expect we'll continue to see expansion in the margin as we grow and as revenue returns to a growth phase, we will get comfortably back into our long-term margin model. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think, Joe, as well, in addition to what Rich has said, it's important to point out that, first and foremost, we're innovation-centered, and if you look at the vintage bands of our products in each of the segments, the big segments that we address, industrial, automotive, consumer and communications, we're seeing ASP increases year-on-year. We're putting more value into our products. We're capturing more value. So I think that is kind of the root of things when I look forward. That's -- I mean that's what's happening to -- that's the origin, if you like, of the margin story for ADI. Our diversity helps us a lot. Our franchise isn't as price-sensitive as many. And as I said earlier, the life cycles matter. When we get our products designed in the pricing is tremendously stable. The other thing that's been happening from a price dynamic over the last several years is that whereas Moore's Law kind of taught everybody that we could give back a lot of the value that was generated in prior years, in the New Year. That has stopped. We asymptote roughly to zero now. We don't give price away. We compete for sockets, computed innovation, but that is really the origin of ADI's margin story. Michael Lucarelli : All right. Thank you, Joe, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all reconciliations are there as well. Have a great Memorial Day weekend, and thank you for listening on ADI's call. Operator : This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince? Vincent Roche : Thanks very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. The stronger demand for a high-performance product portfolio and skillful execution resulted in third quarter revenue of more than $2.3 billion, operating margin north of 41%, and EPS of $1.58, all above the midpoint of our outlook. These favorable results, combined with improved customer inventory levels and order momentum across most of our markets, increase my confidence that our second quarter marked the cyclical bottom for ADI. My optimism remains guarded, however, as challenging economic and geopolitical conditions are limiting a sharper recovery. We continue to balance near-term fiscal discipline with strategic investment in our long-term growth initiatives, positioning ADI to capitalize on the extraordinary opportunities that we see ahead. Now I'd like to draw attention to our industrial end market, which is our largest, most diverse, and most profitable business, generating durable revenue streams that last close to two decades, on average. As our business begins to recover from the pandemic's volatility, we're excited about the tremendous long-term growth opportunities of the industrial market. We offer our customers an unparalleled suite of high-performance solutions stretching from antenna to bits, sensor to cloud and nanowatts to kilowatts. Our extensive technology portfolio, combined with our deep domain expertise and engineering muscle, has enabled us to secure leading positions across the most attractive industrial sectors. Now, with growing digital software and algorithmic capabilities augmenting our cutting-edge analog portfolio, ADI is strongly positioned to solve our customers most difficult challenges in factory and process automation, energy efficiency, secure connectivity and many, many more. To illustrate the power and potential of our industrial franchise, let me share with you a few examples of how our recent innovations are unlocking new revenue streams and positioning us for strong growth in the years ahead. For example, our Instrumentation and Test business, which includes scientific instruments, electronic test and measurement, and automated test equipment is essential to the important scientific and technological advancements of the digital era. Within automated test equipment, for example, our next generation solutions increase channel density and throughput, while reducing energy consumption by up to 30% per system. These are crucial parameters for testing complex, high performance compute GPUs and high bandwidth memory systems for AI. As the AI infrastructure build up remains a priority for global hyperscalers, we expect growth to continue into 2025 and indeed well beyond. Turning now to Aerospace and Defense, which has been our most resilient business during this downturn, ADI's domain expertise and high performance portfolio across orphan microwaves, high speed and precision converters, power and MEMS uniquely positions us to deliver complete edge solutions offering our customers scale, velocity and lower total cost of ownership. As an example, we're building upon our programmable Apollo signal chain platform today to create full software defined RF communications and sensor systems, which has the potential to increase our sound by five times in commercial, defense and aerospace communication systems. Indeed, we see a path to double-digit revenue growth in this sector in 2025, fueled by several high value design wins that are going to production. In Automation, though we've seen a slow recovery to date, we remain strongly confident in its future growth potential as the benefits of increased productivity are ever more clear. Customers are prioritizing enhanced digitalization and IT/OT integration on their factory floors. Their deployments of in-line instrumentation and advanced robotics are driving the need for more sensing, edge processing, secure connectivity, and car management. Within robotics, we're seeing a progression from fixed-arm machines to autonomous and mobile robots to eventually humanoid robots. This evolution creates additional opportunities for a precision signal chain franchise. And sensing, connectivity, and motion-controlled subsystems with fully isolated and efficient power solutions can drive content from hundreds of dollars in robots today to thousands in autonomous and humanoid robots. What is additionally exciting about these advances is their broad applicability beyond factories, such as surgical robots and imaging systems in healthcare. ADI's products have the potential to dramatically improve a surgeon's effectiveness through a more precise surgical experience with lower latency connectivity. Additionally, patients gain the potential benefits of shorter hospital stays and fewer complications. The evolution in robotics is expected to unlock billions of dollars of potential opportunity for a high-performance analog, mixed signal, power connectivity, and sensing solutions. We see the potential for a doubling of our robotics revenue in the years ahead. Turning now to Energy Transmission and Distribution, our customers are modernizing and digitalizing the electrical grid to respond to exponentially accelerating energy demand driven in part by the proliferation of electric transportation and rapid AI adoption. This process is resulting in a grid that is distributed dynamic and bidirectional, a paradigm shift from the past model of linear stable supply. We're working with traditional suppliers and disruptors to enable the necessary intelligence for the new grid from decentralized power plants to the distribution edge. We're leveraging our analog and algorithm capabilities in cutting-edge energy monitoring and management solutions. Additionally, our battery management technology increases capacity and improves energy utilization in the grid's renewable energy storage systems. This reimagined intelligent grid of the future has the potential to expand our return by over $10 billion and creates tailwinds for our energy franchise for many years to come. Given the synergies across our industrial portfolio, our pace of innovation and the emergent signs of market recovery, we're optimistic for our industrial business that has turned the corner and \u201825 will be a robust growth year. So in closing, our investments in high-performance analog solutions are enabling us to intersect with and leverage the numerous concurrent secular trends that transcend the business cycle and will propel us into the future. Our commitment to our customers' success and to impactful innovation will be the path that carries us there, ultimately increasing long-term shareholder value. And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rich, who'll take you through the numbers. Richard Puccio : Thank you, Vince. And let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Third quarter revenue of $2.31 billion came in above the midpoint of our outlook, finishing up 7% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year. Industrial represented 46% of revenue in the third quarter, finishing up 6% sequentially and down 37% year-over-year. Every major application increased sequentially except for automation, which declined at a much slower pace than it had in previous quarters. Automotive represented 29% of revenue, finishing flat sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. We saw continued double-digit growth year-over-year for our industry-leading connectivity and functionally safe power platforms. Conversely, automotive production cuts are extending inventory digestion across customers, particularly impacting our legacy automotive and electrification businesses. Communications represented 12% of revenue, finishing up 10% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Slowing customer inventory digestion enabled both wireless and wireline growth sequentially. And lastly, Consumer represented 14% of revenue, finishing up 29% sequentially and increased year-over-year for the first time since 2022. We saw diversified growth across applications with notable strength in portables and gaming. Now let's move from the top line to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 67.9%, up 120 basis points sequentially, driven by higher revenue, higher utilization and favorable mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were $619 million, up modestly sequentially, driven primarily by higher variable compensation. Operating margin of 41.2% exceeded the high end of our outlook. Nonoperating expenses finished at $70 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 10.8%. The net result was EPS of $1.58, which finished near the high end of our outlook. Our financial position is solid and I'd like to call out a few items from our balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q3 with more than $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and a net leverage ratio of 1.2. Inventory decreased $51 million sequentially and days declined to 178 from 192. As planned, we reduced channel inventory further this quarter with weeks ending near the low end of our 7 to 8 week target. Operating cash flow for the quarter and trailing 12-month was $0.9 billion and $4 billion respectively. CapEx for the quarter and trailing 12-month was $154 million and $1 billion respectively. For fiscal \u201824, CapEx is tracking to our $700 million plan, which is down roughly 45% versus 2023 as our hybrid manufacturing investment cycle tapers. Not included in these figures are the anticipated benefits from both the European and U.S. CHIPS Act. During the last 12 months, we generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow or 30% of revenue. Over this same time period, we have returned $2.8 billion via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our strategy is to return 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders over the long term. Now I'll turn to the fourth quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.4 billion plus or minus $100 million, up 4% sequentially at the midpoint. We expect sell through to be roughly equal to sell in this quarter. At the midpoint on a sequential basis, we expect industrial and consumer to increase, communications to be flattish and automotive to decrease. Operating margin is expected to be 41% plus or minus 100 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13% and based on these inputs, EPS is expected to be $1.63 plus or minus $0.10. In closing, our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook support our view that we have passed this cycle's trough. However, challenging economic and geopolitical conditions are limiting a faster demand recovery. I will now give it back to Mike for Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Rich. Let's get to our Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow -up question, please requeue and we'll take your question if time allows. With that, we have our first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you so much. Great to see the turn here. Vince, could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on this sort of mixed environment, right? Because inventories have bottomed, access to inventories have bottom, at the same time end demand seems to be kind of mixed. So, as you navigate through this period, could you elaborate a little bit on your visibility, how's backlog trending? Are you finally starting to see new products ramping more into production? Because these are typical signals that you want to see at the beginning of a new cycle. Vincent Roche : Yes, thanks, Tore. Well, I'd say first and foremost, we run this company on POS signals. That's how we plan our production, how we run the company operationally. So, we pay very, very close attention to what's happening in terms of the end market demand. And my confidence has increased since last quarter that indeed 2Q was the cyclical bottom. We've exited 3Q with very, very lean channel inventory. We've taken inventory of our own balance sheet though. We're positioned with a very, very healthy backlog of inventory on our own balance sheet so that the anticipated demand upsurge as we expect in 2025 were very, very well equipped and ready to meet that. So foray in the fourth quarter, as we've said, we expect to see continued sequential growth. And indeed, we'll also see, I think, particularly in the industrial area, continued improvement on customer inventory levels. So, look, it's all the whole recovery, the ramp of the recovery will depend on the macro situation. But nonetheless, given the design wins, we've a record design win pipeline in the company. So we're facing many, many secular tailwinds with a very strong pipeline, a very, very good supply line, and with a very, very lean inventory on the customer's balance sheet. So that gives me the optimism, Tore, that we're very, very well positioned coming into the new year. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Yes, thank you. My question is on the trajectory of automotive versus industrial. It seems like automotive entered into an inventory correction a little bit later, and so far, has been much less severe. I guess you sort of talked about some ongoing headwinds in that space. Can you just talk about what overall drawdown might you expect in automotive and where are we in customers kind of growing down safety stock inventory Richard Puccio : So, Joe, this is Rich, and I'll take a crack at that one. So, I'll just level set a little bit from our perspective. And what we're seeing in the market cars continue to become more electric and software-defined, which is also driving our semi-content growth, largely trying to address increased battery densities, more sensors displays. And we do expect that is going to be a long-term tailwind to our business. However, and this is where we're starting to see some of the pullback. The vehicle market has softened in the near-term. We're seeing our customers pull back on their production. And at this point, we're seeing them start to choose to burn off some inventory. So we are seeing that, right? The softness is evidence in our results. Auto has been down year-over-year for two straight quarters and we expect it will be down again in 4Q. And from a bookings perspective, we did see a decline in bookings in auto. In particular, we've seen inventory digestion in our legacy auto and in our BMS portfolios. And we expect that's going to continue into at least the fourth quarter, particularly when you consider the challenging purchasing environment that currently exists for customers. However, to your question around the peak to trough unless our returns to pandemic levels, we don't see the peak to trough being nearly as dramatic as we saw in our other end markets. The underlying secular growth trends that I described driving higher semi content. Also, we've continued to see more penetration and value capture across all vehicle types, whether it's ICE, plug-in hybrid of electric or full electric in the fastest growing applications. If you think about that, ADAS, digital cockpit and electrification. So we will be down, but we don't expect that the cycle depth to be as severe as we saw, for example, in industrial. Joseph Moore : Great, thank you very much. And I guess as a follow-up, are you seeing that behavior any different regionally? Is the China automotive market different than the western markets in terms of where they are? Vincent Roche : No, I'll say overall, it's pretty unanimous across all markets. I'd say China, all of us did okay. We talked about some design and branding there, so that's helping offset some of the softness. But it's an overall comment, auto is a bit weaker today than it was 90 days ago, whether it's North America, Europe or Asia. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Vince, glad to hear about your optimism about turning the cyclical corner. Do you think the environment allows for sequential growth to continue into Q1? Seems like industrial could grow, autos, I'm not sure, given some of the bookings commentary. And consumer tends to be down seasonally. So just conceptually, how should we model the shape of this recovery into Q1? Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yes, well, at this point it's hard to call, given that the environment is still a little, let's say, a bit of disequilibrium, but I think generally speaking, we would probably expect to see a bit of a seasonal decline in the first quarter, and then a bounce back in the second, and I think that's the sentiment, but overall I maintain my outlook that we will see a brisk growth year in \u201825. Richard Puccio : And then I'll help you out a little bit on the seasonality question. It's been a few years now since we've seen seasonal trends in our business. You're right. If you look back over the past 10, 15 years for ADI, consumers down 10%-plus sequentially in 1Q, and the BV markets of industrial, auto, and comms are down low single digits, as Vince said, there's probably no belief today that we'd be any better than seasonal given where we are today, but we'll update you in 90 days of how we feel about 1Q. Vincent Roche : Yes. I think the big modulator for us will be what happens in industry in particular, and what I can tell you is that the various C-suite conversations I've had with our industrial customers would suggest that their optimism is also strong for \u201825. Operator : Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask on that answer. So you were above seasonal in fiscal Q3 or above seasonal in fiscal Q4. Sounds like you're not willing to commit that you're going to be above seasonal in fiscal Q1. The street's modeling like 5% or 6% above seasonal for fiscal Q1. Was there something that happened in bookings? Did bookings like slow in the last couple of weeks or the last month or something to make you not want to commit to the fact that fiscal Q1 would be above seasonal or just that it's 90 days away and you just don't want to comment on it? Thanks. Vincent Roche : I'll start out on the street expectations and then Rich talk a little about bookings. We never guided 1Q. I think the street makes up -- the street expectation for 1Q. I think the street is of everyone better than seasonal for a calendar 4Q or a fiscal 1Q. I would hope of a snapback. I would say, yes, there are things that have changed in 90 days, but we're optimistic about \u201825 and full year. We just don't know if it's above seasonal in that outlook for a good year in \u201825. I'll pass it to Rich to go through some of the bookings dynamics. Richard Puccio : Yes, so from a bookings perspective up until Q2, as we talked about, we'd seen three straight quarters of broad-based bookings improvement. However, Q3 was different. We saw continued bookings growth for industrial, consumer, and communications, but we did see automotive orders decline, which resulted in a modest drop in our total bookings during the quarter. We did still end with a book to bill around parity. If I look at it from a geographic perspective, regionally bookings were the weakest in Europe. Americas was modestly weaker, which offset bookings growth in Asia. Operator : Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It was good to see inventory on your balance sheet come down again, and you guys spoke to channel inventory coming down as well. As you look forward, what are your thoughts on utilization rates internally? How are you engaging with your foundry partners, and what's embedded in your October quarter outlook as it pertains to the channel? Thank you. Richard Puccio : So, as I noted in the last call, we said both utilization and, in fact, gross margins had bottomed in Q2, and that is proving to be true. From an inventory in the channel perspective, the expectation is we will ship to end demand. We are currently at the very low end of our range in the channel at seven to eight weeks. And I think we've mentioned previously if we saw continued improvements, we would start shipping to end demand. So we will do that in the fourth quarter. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Vincent Roche : Obviously, when it comes to the balance, we have a hybrid manufacturing system which enables us to keep utilization rates as high as possible internally, and when our factories run out of capacity, then we have lots of choices externally for silicon capacity. So obviously, we've got a lot of inventory on the balance sheet, and our factories are well capable of improving utilization rates as the demand continues to improve over the coming quarters. Toshiya Hari : As a quick follow-up, I think your internal utilization rates last quarter were in the mid-50s, if I'm not mistaken. Are you at or above 60% at this point, or if you can comment on that. Richard Puccio : We have to be -- given our look at the utilization towards as we give the rate, I would say there were lower last score to move in higher here in 3Q and 4Q, and there were well off the normal level, they're all called 85% to 90% utilization. Toshiya Hari : Got it, thank you. Richard Puccio : And then I'll give you some context -- I'll give you some little context. What does this mean as utilization ramp? What does that mean for gross margins? If you look at the decline of gross margins over the past year or so, about half the decline relates to utilization, the other half relates to mix. So you can see as you listen, pick up what that means for gross margin expansion. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could give us a little more granularity on the segment guide for next quarter. And then you said industrial, and I think consumer up and auto down. Any more for the color, like is consumer usually up, is it up double digits, is industrial up mid-single, auto down by low single, like any further color you could give us on the segments would be helpful. Vincent Roche : Sure, Stacy, I'll grab that one. Yes, so let's start with consumer. You're right, consumer's up about double digits, about 10% or so embedded in our outlook. Industrial's had another also solid growth quarter, probably high single digits sequentially. We had cases about flattish plus minus, depending on kind of how things go here, and although the weak market as we discussed and hit a little bit earlier on the call, probably down low single digits sequentially. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That's helpful. If I could have a quick follow up, just how are you thinking about OpEx growth in the next quarter? It was pretty well under control this quarter. Is there anything that drives that up? Like what do you think about the OpEx trends as we're going to the end of the year? Richard Puccio : So Stacy, I'll take that one. So obviously we exceeded the high end of our outlook in the third quarter, given the beat on gross margin and revenue as well as our continued cost management. Our Q4 guide obviously does imply a modest margin contraction sequentially despite our expectation for higher revenue and gross margin. The main driver of that is our increase for merit increases that will go into effect during the fourth quarter. So that will be a downward pressure as we head into the fourth quarter. Vincent Roche : I mean, the big margin on our OpEx, Stacey, is obviously the bonus. And that obviously with declining profit and revenue over the past several quarters, that dropped accordingly. Now, with increase, with growth in revenue and improvement in profitability that will obviously increase. But that's self-funding, so to speak. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. How much do the OpEx go up then? Vincent Roche : For our fourth quarter outlook, I\u2019d say sequentially increase in our OpEx around 5%. Operator : Our next question comes from Christ Danley with Citigroup. Christopher Danley : Thanks guys. First, just a little clarification on inventory in the auto market. Vince, I said it, I think at the beginning you talked about inventory is very lean out there, but then you're also saying that there's inventory digestion going on in the automotive market. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Richard Puccio : Dan, I'll grab that, and then Vince, talk about the overall customer inventory. Yes, I think every market spawned in different cases of inventory digestion. We feel good about industrial consumer comms have really normalized inventory levels. There are pockets on the auto side that's still, I'll call it digesting. I mean, production levels have been cut over the past quarter, whether it's an ICE car or an EV car. That impact inventory levels and desire to hold inventory on their balance sheets. From that standpoint, Chris, I don't know, Vince, if you have anything to add. Vincent Roche : I think, Chris, overall, we've seen the worst is behind us, I think, in the industrial consumer and comms market. But automotive, I think, is a sector where we will see some inventory digestion issues into at least the early part of 2025. Christopher Danley : Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a quick clarification on industrial. How would you characterize your, I guess, booking/ visibility on the industrial market now versus three months ago? Is it roughly the same, or has it improved a little bit? Richard Puccio : Hey, Chris, it's Rich. I would say visibility is pretty consistent. And as we talked about, we're seeing continuing growth sequentially across all of the sub-elements of industrial with the exception of automation, which we are seeing improvements, but not yet seeing growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So for fiscal \u201823, China domestic consumption, I think was about 18% of their total revenues, it was the worst performing geography. Last couple of quarters where bookings in China have been growing sequentially. Did that translate into sequential revenue growth out of the region in the July quarter? And then it looks like orders from the China region grew sequentially in July. How are they trending so far quarter-to-date? Are you still seeing sort of positive signs out of this region? Vincent Roche : Yes, we continue to see strong performance from a bookings perspective in China. We did see double digit growth across industrial, auto and comms being slightly offset by a decrease in consumer. So China does continue to perform well. And our design win and our pipeline there are very strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Butler with TD Cowen. Joshua Butler : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe you can walk through some of the puts and takes into gross margin into the October quarter. Back the envelope, I'm getting to roughly stable sequentially despite the revenue increase and I imagine utilization is improving as well. How much of that is mixed? And in particular, is there any changes in the pricing environment as we get sort of through this digestion into what I would imagine is a more competitive environment. Thank you. Richard Puccio : Yes. I'd say it's, as we previously mentioned, it is significantly impacted by the favorable mix. Obviously, we get a benefit out of the revenue upside. From a pricing perspective, and I've talked about this before, we continue to see pretty stable pricing, and I do expect that to continue. Obviously, it's different by geography and for big and small customers, but on balance, we are continuing to see stable pricing, and I expect we will see that going forward. Vincent Roche : Once our products are installed in a particular customer's design, they tend to, in the industrial business, they will stay for decades, and pricing is very, very stable there. Where the pricing, or the competitiveness, is for new sockets, new wins, but nothing is new there. Now, we as a company -- we play in the high end of the game in terms of innovation, service, support, and so on and so forth. So that's the game we play. In the game we will continue to play. We significantly higher ASPs than most. And those ASPs increase with each new generation of product. So I think overall, as Rich said, the pricing environment is stable. And so I don't see that as a headwind on margin. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Josh. I think that's all the time we have for questions today. I thought we had a little more time, but it's August. You guys can go out there and enjoy the weather a bit. So thanks for joining us, all. We look forward to future calls with you guys, and have a great rest of summer. Vincent Roche : Thank you.

I would like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours. Michael Lucarelli : Excellent. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche, and ADI's CFO, Rich Blue Shield. All of our materials can be found at investor.analog.com. Onto disclosures : Information about this discussion includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our filings with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. In terms of gross margin, operating and non-operating expenses, operating margin, tax rate, EPS, and free cash flow, comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items. When comparing our results and historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. Please note, references to EPS are on a fully diluted basis. And with that, I will turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vincent Roche : Thanks very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. Our first quarter results reflected the continued steady recovery from our second quarter cyclical bottom with revenue, operating margin, and earnings per share all finishing above the midpoint of our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2024, revenue finished at $9.4 billion with earnings per share of $6.38. The headwinds we faced in fiscal 2024 were most notably pronounced post-pandemic inventory digestion and the challenging macro backdrop muting demand recovery. Despite the external challenges, however, our business model and disciplined execution delivered an impressive 41% operating margin for the year and a free cash flow margin of 33%, up from 29% in fiscal 2023. Importantly, we continued investing in key value generation and capture initiatives to better position ADI to solve our customers' most difficult challenges at the Intelligent Edge. In R&D, which is our first call on capital, we continue to strengthen our world-class analog foundation while extending the scope of our innovation capabilities with investments in digital software and AI. Those investments resulted in, for example, last month's launch of ADI's new CodeFusion Studio software development platform, creating a resource-rich hub and ensuring a programming environment for embedded co-development in support of our analog mixed signal power and digital franchises. To better secure the increasingly connected intelligent edge, we also launched the ADI Assure Trusted Edge Security Architecture, which will enable cybersecurity capabilities on ADI products. The addition of new tech stack capabilities to our tremendous analog foundation enables us to deliver ever more sophisticated innovations for our customers. Our intense focus on R&D is reflected in the double-digit growth of our design win pipeline during fiscal 2024. That growth was enhanced by momentum in our Maxim revenue synergies pipeline across such areas as GMSL, healthcare, and data center power, putting us firmly on a path to achieving our goal of $1 billion in revenue synergies by 2027. Now, to accelerate pipeline growth and conversion, we continue to evolve our digital customer engagement platforms to support a greater range of technical expertise and customer needs. We also expanded our cadre of field engineering experts to provide world-class support and service to our global customer base. Our customers value our thought leadership, the breadth and depth of our cutting-edge technology stack, the strength and resilience of our supply chain, and our service and support integrity. Let me share a few examples with you now. In Industry 4.0, semiconductor content as a percentage of CapEx investments continues to expand rapidly as factories integrate IT and OT to connect and software-define the factory floor. This is creating tremendous growth for ADI's sensor-to-cloud automation solutions, with a large number of customers leveraging our sensing, power control, and deterministic Ethernet technologies. On the factory floor, our intelligent motion and positioning solutions are being designed into robotic systems by several large customers, expanding our content per robot by three times. In our Instrumentation and Test business, ADI's cutting-edge analog signal and power capabilities are the foundation for the leadership position we've established in the AI-related SoC and high-bandwidth memory test market, where our content per tester stretches into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now looking ahead, we're developing additional mixed signal and digital capabilities to further reduce test time and power requirements, which we believe will result in more than 20% additional ADI content per test. Within the healthcare sector, our precision signal processing and real-time connectivity solutions are critical to the rapidly expanding surgical robotics market. And in the fast-growing continuous glucose monitoring space, we have won multiple opportunities across several customers. Our unique digitally enabled analog front-end solutions increase the accuracy and power efficiency of sensors and enable a better patient experience by extending battery life from days to weeks. Aerospace and defense has remained our most resilient industrial segment during this downturn, with stellar design win pipeline growth. We expect revenue growth to accelerate to a double-digit level next year due to increasing global defense budgets and the proliferation of space communication systems that rely on our higher value integrated RF modules and subsystems. Within automotive, the performance advantages of our battery management systems are driving substantial pipeline growth among OEMs. In addition, we're also seeing momentum for these solutions in electrical grid storage systems. These trends, combined with recent wins, give us confidence that our BMS revenues should return to growth in fiscal 2025 with meaningful contributions from our higher value wired solution. The proliferation of higher content vehicles that use more power management connectivity and an increasing number of sensor platforms is expanding our content across all vehicle types, combustion engines, hybrids, and indeed full EVs. This trend drove our GMSL and A2B connectivity and functionally safe power franchises to new high watermarks in fiscal 2024, and with a record design win pipeline, we expect this growth to persist. Michael Lucarelli : Notably, we added to our portfolio of connectivity solutions by launching our Ethernet to the Edge bus solution, or U2B, which is an enabler of the software-defined vehicle vision. And out of the gate, we have design wins with several major OEMs, including BMW. In communications, we've seen a positive inflection in the wireline market and expect that growth to continue in FY 2025 and beyond. Our confidence is based on significant new wins, including a high precision controller for the optical module and the high-performance compute leaders' AI systems, and our next-gen power solutions, which will begin shipping later in 2025. We're also experiencing tremendous demand from leading data center customers for our new innovative hot swap solution, which significantly extends power and control capabilities for AI-based servers. In consumer, new wins coming to market are driving strong growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the years ahead, given new wins across power, audio, optical, and touch in portable applications at multiple key customers. We've also seen growth in wearables. For example, our VSM platform's superior accuracy at lower power is becoming ever more critical for customers seeking to differentiate by capturing and processing more biomarkers. We've seen design momentum accelerate and content opportunities expand at wearable market leaders as well as in disruptors bringing miniaturized form factors to market. In wearable acoustic systems, our combination of ultra-low power and neural processing with application-specific audio processing algorithms is enabling next-generation noise cancellation and hearing augmentation. We're leveraging these technology innovations in several B2B markets. In addition, turning now to manufacturing, we've invested $2.7 billion in CapEx since acquiring Maxim to increase our capacity and enhance resiliency. We also expanded our foundry partnership with TSMC earlier this year to secure additional 300-millimeter fine-pitched technology capacity at their Japan fab. These investments enable a more flexible hybrid manufacturing model, further insulating our supply from regional shocks and increasing our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years. This unique ability helps us to capture the upside in strong demand backdrops and better protect our gross margins during more challenging times. So in closing, I'm very proud of how ADI has managed through one of the worst inventory digestion cycles our industry has ever seen. While the macro backdrop presents challenges, I'm confident in our continued recovery in fiscal 2025. And with that, now I'll pass it over to Rich. Richard Puccio : Thank you, Vince. And let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll start with a brief recap of fiscal 2024 results. Revenue of more than $9.4 billion, down from the record fiscal 2023, driven by broad-based inventory digestion and sluggish end demand. Gross margin of 67.9% reflects lower revenue factory utilization and mix headwinds. Decline in revenue and gross margins were partially offset by lower operating expenses, which resulted in an operating margin of 40.9% and EPS of $6.38. Moving to fourth quarter results, revenue of $2.44 billion came in above the midpoint of our outlook for a 6% sequential increase, a 10% decline year over year. Industrial represented 44% of our fourth quarter revenue, finishing up 2% sequentially and down 21% year over year. Continued strength in AI-related test, aerospace and defense, and a return to sequential growth in automation more than offset slower end demand driven by a weaker macro backdrop. For the full year, industrial decreased 35% from a record 2023, with every major application declining double digits except aerospace and defense, which significantly outperformed the rest of industrial. Automotive represented 29% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 4% sequentially and down 2% year over year. This was notably better than our original expectation due to steadily improving demand from China throughout the quarter. For the year, automotive declined 2% from a record fiscal 2023 as double-digit growth across our functionally safe power and leading A2B and GMSL connectivity franchises were offset by broad-based inventory digestion and production headwinds. Communications represented 11% of our quarterly revenue, finishing up 4% sequentially and down 18% year over year. Stronger demand from data center customers for our solutions drove low double-digit sequential growth in our wireline business, which more than offset the decline in wireless. For the year, communications decreased 33%, and similar to the fourth quarter, we saw a relative outperformance in our wireline business over wireless. Lastly, consumer represented 16% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 22% sequentially and 31% year over year, driven by higher share in wearables, premium handsets, and gaming applications. For the year, consumer decreased just 1% with double-digit growth in portable applications, balancing double-digit declines in our prosumer business, which is more industrial-like in nature. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 67.9%, flat sequentially as product mix headwinds offset modestly higher utilization rates. OpEx in the quarter was $655 million, up approximately $35 million sequentially, driven primarily by merit increases, which resulted in an operating margin of 41.1%. Non-operating expenses finished at $55 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 12.1%. All told, EPS was $1.67, which finished above the midpoint of our outlook. Despite a tough year, we took decisive action to strengthen our financial position, and I'd like to call out a few results from our balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion in cash, short-term investments, and a net leverage ratio of 1.2. Inventory finished approximately $20 million higher than the third quarter, while days of inventory decreased to 167. Channel inventory finished slightly below the low end of our seven to eight-week target as we continue to prudently manage our supply. Operating cash flow for the quarter was more than $1 billion and more than $3.8 billion for fiscal 2024. CapEx was $165 million for the quarter and $730 million for the year, resulting in fiscal 2024 free cash flow of more than $3.1 billion or 33% of revenue. During the year, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via $1.8 billion in dividends and $600 million in repurchases. Now moving on to guidance for the first quarter. Revenue is expected to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Notably, this implies year-over-year growth when compared to a normalized 13-week first quarter of fiscal 2024, a good indication that we're past the trough and in gradual recovery. We expect sell-in to be roughly equal to sell-through in this quarter. At the midpoint, we are expecting a seasonal decline on a sequential basis as noted last quarter. Industrial, automotive, and communications are each expected to decline by low single digits, with consumer down around 15%. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 40%, plus or minus 100 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be 12 to 14%. And based on these inputs, EPS is expected to be $1.53, plus or minus 10 cents. I'll conclude by noting a few items as we begin the new fiscal year. As Vince mentioned, we made great progress building a more agile and resilient hybrid manufacturing model. As such, we expect our CapEx spend will moderate back to our long-term model of 4 to 6% of revenue in fiscal 2025. We expect this normalized CapEx level and planned receipt of investment tax credits tied to both the US and European CHIPS Acts will provide tailwinds to fiscal 2025's free cash flow. Importantly, while we have delivered on our commitment to return 100% of free cash flow since our Maxim acquisition, fiscal 2024's return was lower due to our decision to increase balance sheet cash during this period of macroeconomic uncertainty and to help us extinguish $400 million of debt coming due in fiscal 2025. That said, investors can expect us to revert to our targeted return of 100% of free cash flow in fiscal 2025. I'm now going to turn it back to Mike for Q&A. Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Rich. Let's get to the Q&A session. I ask that you limit yourself to one question to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have follow-up questions, please re-queue. The waiting question time allows. With that, we have our first question, please. Operator : Thank you. For those participating by telephone, dial in. If you have a question, if your question has been answered and you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you're listening on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking your question. We'll pause just for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And I show our first question comes from the line of Chris Danley from Citi. Go ahead. Chris Danley : Hey. Thanks, guys. Just a little color on the auto strength. Can you talk about how big China is as a percent of your auto business? And then within that, how much of the strength was from, say, EV versus ICE or all these EV startups that we're hearing about from China? Thanks. Richard Puccio : So I'll give you a little bit of the perspective, Chris, on the auto near term. So on the last call, we expected the sequential decline in Q4 given the drop we talked about in bookings during Q3. An adjustment to production for multiple of our OEMs. However, toward the end of Q3, bookings started to improve and that continued throughout our Q4, with stronger demand in China reflecting EV volume growth, share gains, and content growth. As for the other geos, we saw broad weakness, but upside in the U.S., which returned to sequential growth driven mainly by our BMS and wireless BMS portfolio. Secular demand for ADAS and next-gen infotainment continues to drive strength globally for our functionally safe power, audio, and video solutions. Content and share growth in these areas have helped offset broad inventory headwinds resulting in a shallower correction in other end markets. I'd also note that while BMS is still facing inventory headwinds broadly, we saw a strong uptick in China reflecting the expanded share we talked about on our Q2 call compounded by volume growth in the region. BMS also improved in the U.S., including growth for our higher content wireless solution, which is now 10% of total BMS. And as Vince mentioned, design win activity was strong in 2024, giving us confidence that BMS will return to growth in fiscal year 2025. Vincent Roche : A little more color, Chris, than what Rich has just said. So you know, we've got a really high-performance portfolio. We've got many, many different SKUs, if you like, in that portfolio. And, you know, we're playing the high-performance game with the big players in China for merit. So that's the same business there. Michael Lucarelli : And they've got some comments on the US-China kind of relative what's the mix of China. Our China business looks a lot like ADI enterprise where industrial are more of the two biggest percent of our revenue in China. I think about 80% of the China business. Comms is in the teens, consumers below 5%. Chris Danley : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. CJ Muse : Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Vince, you talked about a number of company-specific drivers that should allow you to outperform in calendar 2025. So I was hoping you could kind of use that as a backdrop and then maybe layer in kind of your thoughts on how the cycle will kind of emerge from today's trough. And you know, what your kind of thoughts are in terms of pushing, you know, business through 2025 and 2026. Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yeah. Thanks, CJ. So yeah, obviously, we've already stated our first quarter will be down, so we expect to start getting back to a positive growth trajectory in the second quarter. I think during 2025, if I were to kind of rank the market recoveries, you know, I think it'll be led by industrial. We have very healthy customer inventories. The channel is below seven weeks, and that's a big part of the supply chain into the industrial sector. You know, you couple that with the green shoots that we've mentioned already in areas like AI, tests, and aerospace and defense, which I called out in the script. So I think the compare is easier overall. And, you know, as a result, I think industrial, given the signs we see, will recover briskly in 2025. I've been in consumer, we have a much more diversified business than we've ever had. We've better portfolio than we've ever had. Inventory is normalized and we're already seeing the benefits. We saw it in our in our 4Q results, three and 4Q results, the strength of our consumer business. I think next is the comms business. You know, it declined by over 30% in 2024. And I think that was really an inventory digestion too. So we feel at this point that we're through the worst of the supply normalization. And as we talked about in the scripts, we're beginning to see steady demand improvement, particularly in wireline. Driven by the build-out of these new externalized intelligence systems. And you know, the AI infrastructure. So we're not seeing much on the wireless side. We've I think at a low point in wireless during 2024. So I think it'll all depend on the carrier CapEx investments in 5G moving ahead. Last but not least, the automotive sector. We expect to see continued momentum in areas of function, we say power, the connectivity things that I spoke about, and, essentially, it's globally to be driving share and penetration across all the different types of platforms. So you know, we've had a tough year in 2024 in BMS. 2025, we had expect to see that get back to a better shape, get back to a growth pattern. And you know, given that all of us down just 2% in 2024, it's a tough compare moving ahead. But overall, we feel that we'll be on a solid growth path as well. So that's the ranking, CJ, it's a long answer to a simple question. Thanks, CJ. CJ Muse : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. My question is on Q4 Industrial and then how it sort of shaped fiscal 2025. I think for Q4 industrial, if I'm not mistaken, you had expected sales to grow high single digit. I think they went up only modestly. And then you're guiding Q1 Industrial down again sequentially. So Vince, my question is Industrial really out of the woods, what helps it grow above seasonal? Because just assuming seasonal growth for the rest of fiscal 2025 may not be sufficient, right, to really grow fiscal 2025 at a strong pace. So just maybe help us you know, understanding what's happening in the industrial market and when do you expect it to start growing above seasonal trends next year? Richard Puccio : So, Vivek, I'll take that and so Q4, as you mentioned, was a bit lower than we expected. Driven largely by weakness in the broad market and our decision to reduce channel inventory during the quarter. Now as you know, reducing channel inventory has an outsized impact on our industrial business. At the same time, we did see continued strength in ADAS instrumentation and test and a return to sequential growth in automation. If you remember, in the prior two quarters, we've seen significant declines in automation. So to see that return to sequential growth was a very positive sign. You know, taking a step back, we've grown industrial sequentially now for two quarters. Of what we said was our trough in Q2 of 2024. So we feel pretty good that the recovery is still unfolding for us. And now we're gonna wait and give a bit to see what the macros do. But if I look to 2025, you know, one of the important signals for us continues to be we have been under shipping demand for the better part of 18 months. You know, and if you just normalize that for even our historical patterns, or the market patterns, you know, it would indicate we've under shipped something like 20%. Which is how we get confidence in coming out of Q1's seasonal down, we will start to see growth again in industrial in the remainder of 2025. Obviously, the slope of that will be covered a bit by the macro backdrop. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Shane: Hi. Thank you for letting me ask a question. This is Shane from Morgan Stanley on behalf of Joe Moore. Just on your automotive business, how have customer orders and pricing discussions tracked for the growth areas of your portfolio, such as A2B, GMSL, and functional safe power? And then how have they progressed for the sort of other half of the automotive business? Richard Puccio : So I don't break that into two pieces, I guess. I'll talk about pricing first. So from a pricing perspective so far with customers, it's been largely as expected and continuing to exhibit the stability that we've talked about previously. Right? We continue to focus on the high end where our customers value performance versus price. You know, we can commend ASPs for X the industry average. And that has continued to grow over the cycle. You know, as particularly as we, you know, look across our broad large customers, you know, we're becoming more and more important moving from a essentially, a tier two contracting with tier ones to actually partnering with the OEMs at the early stages of design. You know, and we've talked about before prices set at the design in. Tend to stay pretty fixed throughout a long period of time. So sometimes over a decade on average. Although, there is some volume discounts that come through, so we trade off incremental volume for small decreases in price. And then we do look to mitigate those discounts with our vintage increases on our older products. The other thing that's helping on the pricing stability is we are clearly broadly across costs in our business experiencing inflationary environments, which supports continued stability on the pricing side. Michael Lucarelli : And your company, guys, well, love the pieces of the automotive business. You're right we break it down. We got two One, we call it, like, the growth areas. Vince outlined a bunch of those, GMSL, A2B, functionally safe power, and BMS. They make up about half our revenue in auto. Those grew in 2024 over 10%. The other part of the business, the other 50%, is really more standard product portfolio that goes across all the OEMs all customers, and really goes up and down in production. That piece was down about 10% in 2024. And you fast forward to 2025, I think it was be more or the same? Or we see a lot of growth come from those GMSL, A2B, functionally safe portfolio. And we said a couple of times, I called BMS and returned to growth as well. Vincent Roche : Go next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please go ahead. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. Vince, I had a sort of bigger picture question, especially as we embark on this new cycle. So as I navigate your website, I just see some more software products. And I'm just wondering as AI continues to move to the edge, what do you see as a differentiation here for Analog Devices? Especially in relation to some of your other analog signal peers? Vincent Roche : Yeah. Thanks, Tore. Well, software is not particularly new to ADI in the sense that, you know, for many decades, now, we've had a vibrant DSP franchise. With a lot of, you know, tool chain capability, a lot of algorithmic capability, but we've begun really, I think, over the last decade, taking a more application view to the world across all our core markets, industrial, automotive, communications, etcetera, etcetera. And, you know, we've begun moving up the stack from the core base of analog signal power technologies. So we use, I would say, more algorithmic technology to kind of, at the copilot, so to speak, with the core franchise. So everything we do in software is essentially supports the cutting-edge strength that we have in the analog mix signal and power solutions. And you know, it's increasingly important for our ADI to present our solutions to our customers in a way that makes us easier and more enjoyable for them to use our solution that could complexity and sophistication of what we bring to them. So, you know, over the last couple of months, we announced two new parts to our software story. One is what we call CodeFusion Studio. And, essentially, what that is is an open-source software development environment that includes software development kits, tools, debuggers, and so on and so forth. And that enables our customers to get access. Know, to be able to embed ADI's analog and digital technology into their end system solutions. And the second piece is, it goes without saying, cybersecurity is top of mind for everybody. So we've released what we call the ADI Assure platform. And, essentially, what it is, it's a new security architecture that enables us to provide a root of trust from the hardware rights into the cloud, so to speak, and to understand the movement the creation and movement of data across that spectrum. So you know, we are spending more on software than we've done. But we're taking a very holistic view and I'd say using software to drive the innovation system of the company, the innovation within our products around our products, and making it easier for our customers to access our solutions. That's it in a nutshell, I think. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. What are your thoughts on gross margins into Q1 as revenue declines? And do you think the Q1 is the bottom as it does seem like you do think revenue grows off of there? Like, how do we think about the trajectory off of that gross margins in the next year, what does it take to get them back into the 70% plus range? Richard Puccio : Stacy, I'll take that one. So Q4 gross margin was lower than we'd expected due to mix. So with consumer and auto being so much stronger while industrial was weaker, you know, that created some downward pressure because then we had talked about a slight sequential increase, which we didn't see. For Q1, we expected slower slightly lower gross margin given sort of normal factory shutdowns around the holidays. As well as the seasonally lower revenue. You know, if we think about the when will we see sort of the 70% this is gonna continue to be driven by mix and utilization as we grow revenue. Right now, industrial is pretty low mix. And utilization, while no longer decreasing and coming off of our low points back in Q2, remain sort of well below optimal levels. Know, if you wanna think about it from a longer-term perspective, from a revenue view, we'd likely, you know, need revenue in the $2.7 billion plus to start seeing 70%. From a 2025 sort of sequential perspective, as we do, as we mentioned, expect revenue to recover to growth coming out of the Q1 seasonality. We would expect to see gross margin improvement as we work through the back half of the year. And then, obviously, as we've talked about the back half macros will determine how much revenue growth we get and how much incremental margin we see. Michael Lucarelli : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Rich, you just mentioned that fiscal Q2 is gonna be up. I'm wondering what you consider normal seasonal to be in fiscal Q2. It seems like it's up about three to four. So that's the first part of my question. And then the second part is, you sort of strip out autos, I wonder, like, how is book to bill if you could sort of, you know, strip out autos versus normal? Is it trending pretty much as you would? Thanks. Michael Lucarelli : Yes, sir. So I'll grab the first question and then go to the book and build question. I was like, I lost the bet to myself. I thought the two key question me with the top three questions were number seven. So yep. That's what that'll go sometimes. But you're right. We keep on seasonality strength. What does seasonal mean into you? It's been a while since seasonality. Usually, you see industrial and auto up. About mid-single digits in Q2. Communication's up some, not as much. Maybe flat up slightly. Well, consumers down a little bit. So overall, you're up about to mid-single digits in a portal company level. Again, that's seasonal trends. There's a wide band. On that, typically how we think about Q2 for a seasonal perspective. Richard Puccio : Yeah. On the booking side, so as we talked about after the decline in Q3 in auto, total bookings returned to growth driven by continued growth in industrial and a rebound in auto. Overall book to bill was below one, which we would say is pretty normal at this point. Reflecting our seasonally lower Q1 outlook. You know, regionally, bookings were up everywhere, excluding the Americas. And that largely reflects the seasonal decline in consumer. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Vince, a bit of a longer-term question for you. Cycle to cycle, you know, the good news is it sounds like you found the bottom especially on the industrial side. And you mentioned that it was kind of the worst downturn from an inventory perspective in a long, long time. I guess my question is the prior peak, I guess, in your fiscal 2023 is that attainable? And what are the puts and takes to get to that? Because I guess from a big picture question, was that overinflated or was that a realistic target that we should look forward to? And if so, at what time? Vincent Roche : Yeah. Thanks, Ross. Well, I think, you know, first and foremost, our portfolio is in better position than it's ever been. I would say ADI's connection with our customers, big and small, is better than it's ever been. You know, we're investing in believe, in the right areas in the R&D sector. Our pipeline coming out of 2024, it grew double digits year over year. Opportunity pipeline. So I think the company is well positioned. We've also been very, very I would say, taking a very almost purest view to how we flush inventory. So my sense is you know, we've got a supply chain that is well capable of meeting what we believe will be good demand during 2024. To get back to the kind of the 2023 levels, you know, we believe that our business is capable of growing double digits. So, you know, through the rest of the decade here, given the position we've got, the demand that we see, the opportunity pipeline. So and I think know, we will see a good down payment on that future prospect. During 2025. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of William Stein from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. William Stein : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Vince, I think you mentioned data center power management in the prepared remarks, but I'm hoping you can dig into this a little bit. There's been quite a bit of all very know, what some people call charismatic design win up opportunities in that end market. I know that at least one of the companies you acquired, Maxim, had a significant effort in 48-volt PMEC, and I suspect Linear had something there as well. I wonder if you can comment as to the medium-term opportunity as you all see it and maybe any comment on design win traction there. Thank you. Vincent Roche : Yeah. Thanks, Will. So you know, first off, if you just put the entire data center business in ADI perspective, you know, we have really two elements to our power story. I think one is the power solutions that go around the computing chips, and the rest of the, you know, the server infrastructure. The second piece is the control units, things like hot swapping, supervisory, so on and so forth. We've had good traction of that business a long, long time. We've got some new products coming to market. That will continue to boost us in terms of ASP, share, and so on and so forth. We're also getting good traction with our optical control solutions right up to 1.6 terabits. So that's kind of the landscape of products and technologies that we have. You know, if you're going to win anything in this in these this data center business you've gotta play an ecosystem game. So we play with the processor companies. We're playing with the data center companies themselves. And, you know, again, we're picking our places very, very carefully. We're going for the highest end solutions where we can make a big difference in the energy space. By the way, we're even attaching energy solutions at, you know, kind of the more between the grid and the data sector. So we view this power is just merely part of the an energy solution, and we're looking at that from the intersection with grid right down to the chip. Richard Puccio : Thanks, Will. Can we get to our last question, please? Operator : Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Joshua Buchalter : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Wanted to ask about utilization rates. I think you might be the only company in broad-based semis that called out higher utilization rates this quarter. How should we think about how you're thinking about that trending into fiscal 2025? Are you you know, it sounds like sell-in is matching sell-through. Should we just think about that ramping basically directionally and linearly with your revenue or any other puts and takes we should keep in mind as we think about the impact of margins? Thank you. Richard Puccio : Yeah. So I guess I would start with, you know, from a utilization perspective. We've talked about our agile. You know, one of the reasons we've been able to bring utilization levels up is our ability to swing capacity back into our internal fabs. So I think as I've mentioned, we're still not at anywhere near a normalized utilization rate. Our ability to swing during the downturn has allowed us to continue to grow off the drop that we talked about in Q2. So we have seen two quarters of sequential modest I would say modest sequential increases in utilization and as the revenue picks up as we work our way through best fiscal year 2025, I expect that utilization to continue increase to continue. Michael Lucarelli : Alright. Thank you, Josh, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A cockpit transcript will be available on our website. Thanks again for joining the call. Have a great Thanksgiving. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.",
