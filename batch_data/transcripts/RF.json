My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only, at the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. M. List Underwood : Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. We appreciate your participation this morning on our call. Our presenters today are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are here and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our call today, we\u2019ll be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call, and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation. With that said, I will turn it over to Grayson. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Good morning, we appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Today, we reported earnings of $311 million or $0.22 per diluted share, a solid start to 2014. During the quarter we grew loans, we grew deposits and we grew a number of quality households, all while effectively managing expenses. On an ending basis, total loans increased $1.1 billion over the previous quarter and $1.7 billion over the first quarter of last year. Total review and reviewed loan production was up 2% year-over-year. Importantly, loan growth was more broad-based across our product lines and across our margins. Business lending momentum continue, led by growth in commercial and industrial loans. After years of deliberately derisking investor real estate portfolio, we achieved linked quarter growth. On the consumer side, loans continue to be impacted by the residential mortgage market in the first quarter. But were somewhat offset by the growing demand for automobile loans. In light of an improving, but still challenging economic backdrop, we remained focused on things that we can control such as provide a high quality customer service. in that reward we were recently recognized by the Temkin Group, as a top rated bank in the 2014 National Customer Experience ranking, scoring 10 points ahead of the banking industry average. Our team members work hard everyday listening to our customers, in understanding and meeting their needs, which ultimately will result in a greater customer loyalty. We divide our markets across 16 states into 19 different areas. And in this quarter, we achieved net checking account and credit card growth in all areas. In addition, we grew quality households in all areas including consumer, business and wealth management. By adhering to our strategy reset Regions' three equity to serving our customers, we were also deepening customer relationships. We want to be the first choice in our markets when it comes to beating customers financial needs, whether through quality customer service, superior competitive products or enhanced alternative delivery channels. As part of our efforts we further improved efficiency and better serve our customers we continue to rationalize our delivery channels with recent focus on our branch channel. As you may recall, we consolidated a number of offices in the first quarter. While at the same time we invested in new technology and new service formats. We continue to look for opportunities to improve the customer experience at our branches with innovations and technologies. By adapting our delivery channels to how our customers want to bank, we will be able to meet more their needs delivered better value and enhance loyalty. We remained committed to continuously enhancing our risk management infrastructure. It is the important part of our culture and it is essential to the strength and stability of the organization. As such our asset quality continue to improve and our balance sheet is strengthening. Our net charge-off ratio was 0.44% the lowest level since third quarter 2007. In addition our non-performing loans continue to decline. We\u2019ve an ongoing and robust capital planning process that is designed to ensure the efficient use of capital while maintaining a long-term approach to capital allocation in distribution. During the first quarter, we were pleased to receive no objection to our planned capital actions from the Federal Reserve. Our top priority capital deployment continued to be reinvesting our business to achieve organic growth followed by regional dividend payout and appropriate share repurchases. At some point we may consider strategic opportunities consistent with the companies risk tolerance. To sum up, our first quarter\u2019s results reflected a solid start to 2014. We obviously still have plenty of work to do and we continue to successfully execute our business plans to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to David to discuss first quarter results in more detail. David? David J. Turner Jr.: Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Since Grayson already covered kind of overall earnings, I\u2019ll jump right into the details. So let\u2019s start with loans. We achieved a solid quarter of growth with loans up $1.1 billion as any balances were $76 billion. Loan growth continues to be driven by business lending, which increased 2% from the end of last quarter. A majority of this growth was attributable to commercial and industrial loans, which increased 4%. This was led by general industry with middle-market commercial lending across many of our market areas. In addition, we also achieved growth by our specialized industry and asset-based lending teams. And, furthermore, our commercial line utilization increased 170 basis points and commitments from new loans increased 2% to $39 million. Investor real estate loans increased $242 million from the end of the fourth quarter, which marks the first time we achieved growth in this portfolio in over four years and this portfolio has been declining as a result of our de-risking efforts. This growth was primarily attributable to an increase in new home builder and multi-family projects, providing more opportunities to lend within the parameters of our risk appetite. And we expect modest growth in this portfolio over the remainder of this year. Indirect dollar lending achieved another solid quarter of growth as we increased the average number of loans per dealer by 13%. Production increased 4% and loans increased $178 million or 6%. We expect this portfolio to grow as the demand for automobiles continues to rise and due to our efforts to increase pull-through rates from the dealers. As expected, credit card balances declined following a seasonally high fourth quarter. However, we achieved the highest level of sales for new credit cards, with sales up 14% in the first quarter. Also, we\u2019ve recently expanded our offering of credit cards to non-Regions customers residing within our geographic markets. Our home equity portfolio declined linked quarter as the pace of customer deleveraging within the home equity lines of credit was only partially offset by the new production in the home equity loan product. This fixed rate home equity loan product continues to grow and balances increased 5% over the previous quarter. Looking ahead, based on what we know today and our economic forecast, we continue to expect 2014 loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range. Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Average deposits increased $874 million or 1% from the fourth quarter and deposit mix continues to improve than the first quarter as low-cost deposits increased to 90% of total average deposits. Deposit costs remain at a historical level of 12 basis points and total funding costs declined to 33 basis points in the first quarter. We continue to expect 2014 deposit growth to be in 1% to 2% range. Let\u2019s take a look at how it\u2019s impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $831 million, a decline of $15 million or 1.8% from the previous quarter. The decline was attributable to fewer days in the quarter and the impact of the low interest rate environment on loan yields. However, the net interest margin remained steady from the previous quarter at 3.26%, largely reflecting the offsetting impacts of higher tax balances and declines in premium amortization in our investment portfolio. We remain asset sensitive and would expect to benefit from increases to both short-term and long-term rates, primarily due to our adjustable rate loan portfolios. Further increases in long-term rates would continue to benefit the margin, but at a somewhat reduced pace given the prepayment and premium amortization have already slowed considerably. Recently, declines in deposit costs, liability management actions and increases in long-term rates off their mid-2013 lows, have more than offset margin pressure due to a continued low rate environment. These offsets, however, will have a lessened impact going forward. That said, with rates remaining at approximately their current level and with our expectation for balance sheet growth, we expect to maintain a relatively stable margin in 2014. Let\u2019s move onto non-interest revenue. First quarter non-interest revenue was down $88 million from the previous quarter. However, as a reminder, the fourth quarter included benefits of $56 million related to leveraged lease terminations and the sale of investments and low-income housing that were not repeated at the same magnitude in the first quarter. Services charges were down 7% linked quarter and were driven by lower seasonal trends and continued changes in customer behavior. As expected, mortgage income was lower linked quarter as production was down 22% and the mix of new mortgages continued to be driven by new home purchases. Capital markets income declined in the first quarter to $13 million and was primarily attributable to a slowdown in demand for customer derivatives and loan syndications, which were seasonally high in the fourth quarter. Our Wealth Management Group delivered strong results for the quarter. Revenue was up 6% over the last quarter, led by higher investment services fees, higher insurance commissions and solid increases in investment management and trust income. We continue to add high quality wealth investors, financial consultants and insurance brokers to help, uncover and meet the needs of our clients. Let\u2019s take a look at expenses. Adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $846 million in the first quarter, down 4% linked quarter. The fourth quarter included a $58 million regulatory charge and $5 million of expense related to branch consolidations. Additionally, as you\u2019re all aware, last quarter we transferred $686 million of primarily accruing first lien residential mortgages classified as troubled debt restructurings to held for sale. We finalized to sell these loans during the first quarter and actual expenses were $35 million less than originally estimated. Salaries and benefits declined $9 million or 2% linked quarter. In the first quarter payroll taxes were seasonably higher, but were more than offset by lower employee benefits and headcount. Staffing levels have declined from the end of last year due to branch consolidations and other efficiency initiatives. Additionally, legal and professional fees declined $11 million or 24% from the previous quarter. And you may remember that last quarter we announced plans to consolidate 30 branches and incurred a $5 million related charge. An additional $6 million of expense was reported this quarter with respect to that effort related primarily to lease branches. So overall, expenses remain a constant focus and internally receive a great deal of scrutiny. As a result, we continue to expect full year 2014 adjusted expenses to be lower than 2013 adjusted expenses. Let\u2019s do on the asset quality, we continue to make good progress in the first quarter as all our credit metrics improved. Net charge-offs totaled $82 million which represents 0.44% of average loans. This is the lowest net charge-off ratio, we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007. The provision for loan losses was $2 million or $80 million less than net charge-offs. Our non-performing loans declined 1% linked-quarter and inflows of non-performing loans remain steady. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 118%. Notably, criticized and classifieds loans continued to decline, with commercial and investor real estate criticized and classified loans down 1% from the fourth quarter. Additionally, total delinquencies decreased 9% linked-quarter. And based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point of the cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected. Let's take a look at our capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11.9%. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.4%, an increase of 20 basis points from the fourth quarter. We estimate our fully phased-in Basel III common ratio Tier 1 ratio to be 10.8%, well above the minimum threshold. Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. And lastly, based on our understanding of the proposed rule, Regions remain well-positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio. As Grayson mentioned we were pleased with our overall CCAR results and a Federal Reserve having no objection to our plan of capital actions. So in summary, we off to a good start in 2014, and importantly our first quarter results demonstrate that our focus on identifying and meeting more customer needs is generating steady and sustainable growth overtime. Consistent with our Regions 360 approach, we believe that if we remain focused on our customers have an engaged work force and continue to make positive impact to our communities then ultimately we will drive long-term shareholder value. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. M. List Underwood :  Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would ask that each caller please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Let\u2019s open up the line now for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) You have a question from the line of Kevin St. Pierre of Sanford C. Bernstein. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning Kevin. Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  Good morning Grayson. And it would appear with your current loan growth guidance and the current dividend and the share repurchase that's been approved, that capital will continue to grow this year, beyond that 11% Basel III Tier 1 common. And it looks like your total payout ratio is going to be in the 55% to 60% range. Do you anticipate if things go as planned, that you would get more aggressive with next year's CCAR? Or how should we think about that? David J. Turner Jr.:  Yes, Kevin this is David. So we put together our capital plan based on what we believe to be the right thing to do. We laid down our priorities just like we\u2019ve spoken about that a number of times of first, why do we use our capital to generate organic growth and to support our businesses, we believe that\u2019s what capital was given to us for and the generation of new capital should be used for organic growth. We also then want to get our dividend up some and more consistent with the peer group and you\u2019ve seen a movement there. Our next priority is really use the capital in the business the smartest way we can and that includes transactions like growing portfolios. So we are acquiring a credit card portfolio. We\u2019ve looked at and continue to look at acquisition opportunities whether they be banks or non-banks when the market and the environments are right for that and when that does it, we don\u2019t use our capital for those items, just to return to the shareholder. So that the capital then continue to pile up on the balance sheet.  : O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Kevin this is Grayson, I would characterize our capital plan as either aggressive or conservative. We try to put together a plan that we believe is appropriate for the opportunities we see in the market to the extent that the economy outperforms our forecast or to the extent that some of the opportunities we believe that exist don\u2019t prove that, and we accumulate more capital than we had anticipated then we\u2019ll make a different, but also still an appropriate discussion for next year\u2019s capital plan. So as the economy matures and see what happens we adjust, but we are hopeful that we have some opportunities to deploy our capital effectively this year. Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Thanks and just a related follow-up so, assuming at some point you are going to have some reasonable buffer over 7% to one common minimum so say 8%, 8.5%. Do you anticipate a time when you are able, I don\u2019t know if this is 2015, 2016 you are able to manage your capital ratios down with either a special dividend or some sort of payment total payout in excess of 100% or is this center, are we in a situation where you are growing or have to organically grow into those new ratios? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  No I think the capital planning process improves each and every year. We are working on our processes continuously improving the quality of our data, quality of our models, quality of our forecast and as we build confidence internally and confidence externally, I think the opportunities to deploy our capital more effectively will occur naturally. We think we\u2019ve made the appropriate call this year on our capital plan and as things mature we\u2019ll adjust that call as appropriate. And I do think that to your point that things continue along the path our own, will continue to shrink that our capital position and be afforded opportunities to consider how we deploy that. Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Great, thanks very much. Operator :  Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR. Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  Yes, thank you very much. On the loan growth, can you talk about, a little bit, what are you seeing from your customers? You talk very positively about continued loan growth. But what areas are you seeing the most interest, and what are your customers telling you? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Paul, let me sort of describe it this way I think, what\u2019s different this quarter from last quarter is that we saw more diversity of loan demand of both from a product perspective and from a geographic perspective, I would still say that on the commercial side of our balance sheet, we are still seeing more demand in the upper-end of the middle-market and in large corporate lending. There is still more demand there than elsewhere. The lower middle market and the small business customers still to a certain extent, still recovering. And the demand there is still softer than what you would hope at this part of the cycle. On the consumer side, the consumer has strengthened quite nicely over the last several quarters and deleveraged. We see demand there in both as we mentioned in a moment ago in credit card and indirect auto lending and increases in home purchases in mortgage. We have seen a big shift in our mortgage production, production is down. The home purchase is actually up, we are probably at a mix of about 70% purchase and 30% refinance at this junction. We are seeing that on the indirect auto side still a good growth. We are having obviously being much more discipline from a credit perspective in that space. But still see opportunities there, the credit card we saw \u2013 we are offering a lot of new card accounts to customers, balances are seasonally a little low at this juncture, but we are pleased with the progress we are making. I think, when you look at the overall loan demand, we would still like to see the diversity of that demand improve further yet. But I would say that it made a very strong progressive move in the past quarter. We are more pleased with how broad it is today than we were in the last time we spoke. Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And a one quick follow-up on the auto side, you said, that you expect to increase the pull-through. Do you think that area is getting very over competitive because you hear some banks saying that it could be getting over here? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Well, I think clearly the growth in that market all of our teams and risk management when they see a particular product growing rapidly and risk management disciplines requiring to start looking at that particular product sector more closely. There is a lot of participants in the auto lending space and you are seeing growth loan demand in there, particular category. I think you have as an individual institution, you have to decide what part of that markets you want to participate in. We have drawn some pretty bright lines about we are re-participate, we believe we can do that and still show growth. And we are still very confident in the production replacing all our balance sheet. David J. Turner Jr.:  Paul, this is David, I will add to that. One of things, we think about indirect is who we are doing business dealership that we are doing business with. Now we have today about 2,000 dealers that we do business with, normally 8,000 that are actually in our geographic marketplace. So only about 25% of those that we are banking in today. I think that dealership election is very important for us and we are building the relationship that we need, the speed of action that we need and we feel very good about that credit. Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Murray of ISI. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning, Keith. Keith E. Murray \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Thanks, good morning guys. Now just touching on the fee line items for a second, if you look at the service charges on deposits were down 6% year-over-year. You guys talked you had pretty good growth in checking accounts, can you just talk about the dynamic that\u2019s going on there on a year-over-year basis. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: I will make a couple of comments, then ask David to come on as well. Clearly, what we are seeing is from a service charge perspective first quarter is typically seasonally soft, and as you compare against the same time last year, this year we are softer than last year. We do believe part of that was weather related, but we also believe part of that is shifts and consumer behavior, the consumers in much better shape from a financial perspective than they were a year ago. And we are seeing much more discipline on the part of the consumer in terms of how they manage their accounts, both from making sure they maintain balances necessary to overwrite any service charges amount that occur as well as discipline around over drawing those checking accounts. And so we\u2019re seeing a real marketed improvement in how customers are managing their checking accounts. That being said, we still \u2013 we still are encouraged by the number of new quality accounts that we are adding to our balance sheet. And believe that there is an opportunity for us to continue to grow that part of our business going forward. David J. Turner Jr.: Yes I think Grayson is right on the growing the number of customers, I think it is going to be important to us. As we look at our customer base, really want to build deep relationships with those customers, we offer advice guidance and education to these customers to help them with all of our banking products. And we think we\u2019ve seen a change in the customer behavior not only in the industry, a service charge down in industry, but we see at Regions as well, which we think is a good thing. We think we have a good quality customer base, and we are looking to develop those new products, that will serve our existing customer base as well as new households that we are growing, so all-in-all we have seen a decline in place like overdraft fees, but looking to gain on the different service charges and different products that we offer. Keith E. Murray \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Thanks. I was just going to ask the follow-up along those lines on the deposit advance product, which you\u2019d be willing to give us sort of a revenue number that you might be giving up and give us more color on the traction that you have seen articles in American Banker et cetera, you guys are making progress, adding any consumers from tiered pricing et cetera. Just how much traction are you seeing there on the replacement type products? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: I think that clearly what you\u2019ve seen is that we are transitioning away from that particular product and since the first of the year, we not being adding any new customers for that particular product. And we are seeing normal customer attrition out of that product over the next couple of quarters. We will be offering a number of different transitional alternatives to our customers. It\u2019s a little early for us to give you the benefit number on what the revenue impact will be because we need to see how some of these transition strategies how effective they are. We are hopeful that we can transition a number of these customers to more traditional credit based products, but that\u2019s yet for us to prove. Keith E. Murray \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Hi, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks very much. Hi, good morning. In terms of the credit experience, was there anything sort of interesting or unusual going on with respect to recoveries, particularly in the commercial space? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Yes, nothing unusual that we see \u2013 we went into de-risk a lot of credit during the tough times and we sold some credit too. So the recovery opportunities are still clearly are there, but we are seeing some recoveries but nothing unusual has cropped up that we are seeing. Ellen Jones : Yes. We actually look at the \u2013 put the recoveries on a year-over-year basis. Recoveries are relatively flat on a dollar basis and given our lower non-performing loan base, on a percentage basis recoveries are actually up to be broad-based amongst all of the category particularly in commercial is what we are seeing those recoveries coming fast. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: But nothing unusual this quarter on recovery is tracking about as we would have expected. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And then just my related follow-up just sort of steps back for a moment, if on a core earnings basis, we annualized the quarter to about $0.85 of earnings, but with virtually no provision presumably as that number moves back towards some sign of normalized range. What offsets the impact of the higher credit loss experience range for the P&L? David J. Turner Jr.: Well the increases that we see coming it\u2019s a timing issue right. So we continue to have no higher reserve covers than our peers, so little more credit leverage left relative to peers. We see economic expansion coming at some point in time a higher rate environment at some time. So that overall generally increases an economic activity will lift our NII and lift our NIR and execution on our Regions 360, which is a needs based program to bring the entire bank to our customer base. Those are the main areas we see in terms of growing our revenues streams to mitigate what a normal provision would be, the amount at which we can\u2019t tell you today because credit is going on the books today as still the most pristine credit, we looked at regions and in the industry over time. So it\u2019s really a timing issue that\u2019s hard to tell you exactly how and what dollar amount offset would be. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: So the credit quality continues to improve and continues to improve with a pace that generally outpaces our internal projections for that. So we\u2019ve been pleased by that, encouraged by that, the portfolio as David said our loan portfolio today is a much stronger, much better diversified portfolio that we\u2019ve had in the past. To your point is that if you are showing no growth and that credit leverage goes away you got a huge \u2013 huge gap to fill, but you do have to recognize the growth on one hand we are trying to achieve and at the same time the expense management does once that we put in place to continue to try to drive towards a good earnings result as credit leverage dissipates. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.:  Thanks very much. Operator :  Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning, John. John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Good morning. On that three topic, can you just remind us what do you think is adequate long-term loan loss reserve ratio at Regions to the improving \u2013 much improved tech environment. David J. Turner Jr.: Yes, John, this is David. So it\u2019s a great question, we try to \u2013 we have given a range before then we talked the reserve would be in that 1.5, 2 range clearly credit has been more pristine that are longer than we had originally anticipated when we put that out. I think we are 44 basis points worth of loss today. We see that range drifting south. It\u2019s hard to tag that is that total point on the low end. And I think our best guidance we can give you is we have a pretty good model that we feel comfortable with, and we got to let that model work each in every quarter. And it will be what it is. With that being said, if you look at the credit metrics, we see it going south of that range. And where it ends up is your guess from there. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Only credit quality is going to drive that number and we stay focused on our methodologies, our process, modeling, credit losses, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that those processes have a lot of rigor, lot of discipline around them. Unlike David it\u2019s hard at this juncture to definitively tag where those ratios might eventually land. John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.: Okay. All right and then separately, one of you can talk a little bit about the very modest decline in loan yields that we saw in the quarter. But specifically, if you can give us some color on the new money yields, where you\u2019re booking new loans at this point versus the current portfolio yields? And then separately how that comes into play in terms of your margin outlook for relatively stable margin, is that implied, do you expect loan yields to holding in there if not hit higher yield of, thanks. David J. Turner Jr.: Yes, John. Thanks, so as you mention we expect our margins to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. And we define that as one or two points either side of the 326 we have today. I\u2019ll see a prolonged low interest rate environment puts more pressure on loans as old loans, higher priced or fixed rate loans mature, and new loans go on the books. And from a pricing standpoint clearly there is pressure on pricing in the loan portfolio in particular on the commercial side. But we believe that pricing has been \u2013 we\u2019re booking relatively stable there. You saw a slight decline in loan yields for us. Mixed changes with loans can\u2019t make a difference where there is a consumer loan or commercial. And clearly we grew most of our loan growth that was in the commercial space. But those spread have been in the 225 to 250 range. They are kind of holding in there, it\u2019s being on the credit that you\u2019re putting on the books. And so I think you should expect with the rate environment where we are right now. That you\u2019ll see some modest impression on loan yields. We have had as you know deposit and liability management strategies to help offset the funding costs. Now we are down to 33 basis points of funding. And so, all that\u2019s been taken into account on the margin guidance that we gave you. With all that said, if the rate environment stays lower or longer than we expect we will have margin compression. Right now we still are confident enough to give you the guidance on a stable margin going forward for 2014. John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Hey, Ken, good morning. Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Hi, good morning, Grayson. Can I ask you guys a question about expenses and efficiency? This quarter was another good result for expenses that even included the FICA balance. So I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand how much was that elevated first quarter bump. And then also, how you expect the trajectory of both dollars and/or even the efficiency ratio, as we go through the year. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Ken, so if you look at our efficiency ratio, our efficiency ratio actually ticked up just a bit in the quarter. I would tell you that\u2019s more of a revenue side of the equation than the expense side, although we focus pretty intensely on expenses during the quarter. That being said, I believe that as you think about the remainder of this year on the efficiency ratio, I mentioned it last quarter. We\u2019re sticking with it. We believe the efficiency ratio will tick down from where it is today and we think it will finish in the year in the lower 60% range. So we had a lot of pluses and minuses. We had incentives, we had pension, we had FICA. All that, Ken, is taken into account in terms of that go forward guidance, in terms of the lower 60% range for efficiency this year. Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. And as my follow-up on that, then, can you help us understand then approximately like what was at least a FICA balance? I would presume that tension was a helper. So I would presume that $846 million adjusted included that seasonal spike. I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us understand how much that would have been, and do we then presume that we trail off of that from here? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: I think in total if you look at dollars, it\u2019d be in that $11 million to $12 million range for payroll. Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Okay. Operator :  Your next question will comes from the Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning, Betsy. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Hi, good morning. Couple of questions; one on the loan growth. I know you gave the 3% to 5% guidance. And that seems like a relatively wide range as you\u2019re sitting here, given what you saw into March and what you are booking right now. Is there a reason why you can\u2019t tighten that range a little bit from what you gave previously? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  I think as we look at it right now, we\u2019ve given guidance on the 3% to 5%. Clearly we\u2019re one quarter into the year. We think we had some encouraging group in the first quarter. Our pipelines are healthier today. We\u2019ve seen some real optimism in the last, say, six weeks or so as some of the weather-related issues have dissipated. I would say we\u2019re not at the point yet that we feel comfortable with tightening up that forecast. Clearly as the year progresses we will gain confidence in that, but at this juncture we still believe the 3% to 5% range is appropriate. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I\u2019m just thinking about it in the context of how it impacts the NIM, in line with the prior question. As you are looking out on the NIM, you talked a bit about the loan yield impact, but what about the cost of funds? Are there things you could do incrementally on that side, as well? You've got some high-cost debt outstanding, some sub-debt. Is there anything that you could do there to lower the funding costs? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Yes, Betsy, we continue to look at for opportunities when it\u2019s economical to rationalize our funding side. You've seen the actions we\u2019ve taken up to now on repaying some of our debt. The math really has to hold up for us, so we look at it everyday. We realize we have some expenses debt out there. And so, it\u2019s on our radar screen, but we do want to make sure that it\u2019s economical when we do it and that\u2019s probably been the biggest hold up there. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And by economical, you're talking about impact of whatever swaps, hedges? Ellen Jones : We\u2019re a reasonable payback, in terms of the cost that we\u2019re going to incur the one-time charge to capital, in income statement and capital and how quickly does \u2013 that we get payback to that. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. In other words, not refinancing it, but just taking it down? Ellen Jones : We\u2019re refinancing it cheaper (Multiple Speaker) or taking it out completely either way. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Either way. I mean there is still \u2013the math is still the same. Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Good morning, Grayson. If I can ask two unrelated questions, first is, when I look at the capital market side, it was down over 50% in the quarter. And you did call out a slowdown in syndicated loan volumes and customer derivatives, post a strong 4Q. But even beyond that, it does look like the slowdown was beyond prior quarters. So how should we think about the bounce back from here? Do you expect that we should run at a similar rate to the current quarter, or do you think we should move back towards the higher level we were running pre-4Q? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: I think at this juncture, when we look at this Ryan, we have a strong Q4 and we had a strong 4Q and then we had softness in the first quarter more softer than we had anticipated, but nice recovery in the latter part of the quarter. And we still are pretty optimistic about sort of where it goes from here. That being said, I think, the biggest change we saw was how much broader loan demand was across markets and product. And in particular, we pivoted on investor commercial real estate, which has been a declining portfolio for a number of quarters and actually have some reasonable growth this quarter in that segment. So I think that as you look out in upcoming quarters, we still believe that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our loan portfolio. Our goal is to do that in a diversified and prudent manner. Ellen Jones : Ryan, I'll add on the, specific to the capital markets with regards to what was happening. If you go back to the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see a very different rate environment, one where the 10-year, there was increasing people were using derivatives a lot more than they did in the first quarter. So the first quarter rates declined quite nicely and as that happened, people were not \u2013 were willing to run a little more interest rate risk than they would otherwise. So I think all things being equal as we expect rates to continue to climb \u2013 the pace of which is uncertain that as that expectation of a rate increase is coming, you would expect clients the demand more the use of derivatives and therefore big driver of our capital market revenue, 0.4. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Got it. And then you did a nice job early on outlining how you think about capital allocation and capital return. But if I could just dig a little bit deeper \u2013 Grayson, can you share your philosophy or priority, in terms of how you are thinking about your risk tolerance for strategic transactions? And what, in particular, is it that you are looking for? Is it improving density across certain MSAs, building out the wealth management channel? And you guys obviously haven't done a big deal since AmSouth. Just be helpful if you could just refresh what are your parameters, in terms of return hurdles and risk parameters. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: When you look at capital allocation it sort of what we are looking at in terms of growing the company. We are looking forward to diversify our strategy, it doesn\u2019t place a huge debt on any portion of our capital, but it actually places incremental bids in different parts of our business. You\u2019ve seen us allocating not only capital, but resources to our wealth management sector to try to grow that sector out, try to create a more diversified revenue stream for the company. And but also create new revenue streams that we weren\u2019t previously enjoying. I also think we look at that philosophically the same way we\u2019ve a number of markets that we are very dominant in, but we also have a number of markets where our franchise is limited, that we love to see overtime has garnered the ability to expand the density of our franchise in those markets. I do think we are looking for incremental opportunities that add up to be material as opposed to looking for transformational kind of opportunities. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Thanks for taking my question. Operator :  Your next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous Research. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning, Brian. Brian D Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research US LP :  Hi, good morning. I wondered if I could come back to the loan yield question, and maybe come at it from the other side, which is on \u2013 if I look back two years ago, your loan yields were materially below the industry average, about 40 bps, at least on the way I measure it. And if I look today, you are kind of in line \u2013 and especially over the past year. While there has been price compression, it's just \u2013 with every bucket except credit card, your price compression has been a lot less than the industry. How much of that is conscious repricing efforts on your part? How much of that is the markets or the borrower mix shift? Or just why aren't you seeing the same magnitude of price compression on the lending side that\u2019s some of your peers are? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Well, I think, I\u2019ll answer in a couple of ways. Then I\u2019ll ask John Asbury, our Executive in charge of Business Services just sort of add to it. I would say when you look at our portfolio that generally going into the recession, we had more variable rate notes than we did fixed rate as relative to peers. And I also think if you look at our portfolio on the consumer side, we had an equity line portfolio that was priced materially below peer. And so as you look at it today, you are seeing on the consumer side generally speaking loans that are going on our portfolio were priced higher and loans that are maturing off from our portfolio, on the business side we had to make some very specific decisions about in which markets and which more products that we will compete both on price and structure. We believe we\u2019ve been rigorous and disciplined in that regard. But generally speaking, corporate balance sheets are in better shape. And so, corporations that we are providing banking product today can demand appropriate pricing, given the risk characteristics of their company, which have improved dramatically. And so, I do think we feel pricing pressure in our markets. We see that and we are trying to compete against that by competing on value of relationship as opposed to competing on price. That doesn\u2019t mean that we aren\u2019t subject to pricing price. But that does mean, and I think that going into the recession we didn\u2019t have as much discipline around pricing as we should have. We think we\u2019ve largely corrected that and we believe we\u2019re in better place today in terms of what we\u2019re adding on to our books. But I\u2019ll ask John Asbury to speak to that. John Asbury :  Grayson, you summed up very well. First thing I\u2019d point to was your first point, which is we don\u2019t run a large fixed-rate book. We\u2019re about three-quarters variable rate. And so, we did not have to deal with run-off of higher-yielding fixed rates to the same degree as many of our peers did, we believe over the course of the past couple of years. So that will be one issue. The second is, they\u2019re same question. I mean we put pretty powerful disciplines in place in terms of \u2013 in sending and holding bankers accountable for pricing the loans. We did not have a price-driven strategy. That is how we choose to compete. So, yes, we need to be competitive. We use third-party benchmarking services. We have a lot of mechanisms that cause the bankers to want to make sure that we\u2019re paid appropriately for the extension of credit, and honestly I think those are the two big drivers from the business services perspective. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: I\u2019ll add two other things. If you\u2019re referring to the brand in terms of how we compare to our peers; two things, one, the use of derivative interest rate swaps to hedge that risk that John just talked about in terms of the variable. We say the price for not having those hedges in place, and that\u2019s why our margin \u2013 and I forgot which caller had referred to our margin, had been lower for some period of time. So the maturing of the swap is more prevalent at some of our peers than it is for us. And so, as that gets unwound for them, you can see the margins working towards us. The second big thing is purchase accounting and several of the peers who also works its way through the pipeline and while there\u2019s still some more of that accretion, if you will, inuring to the benefit of the margin line for some, we didn\u2019t have that. So we had those two things, swaps and purchase accounting, are big drivers of why we don\u2019t have that downward pressure as much as our peers do. Brian D Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you so much. That was a real thorough answer. Operator :  Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning, Matt. Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Good morning, Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. Just two questions on the loan portfolio. First of all, you mentioned the utilization rate was up about 170 basis points. I don\u2019t remember you saying what the ratio was at the end of the quarter. And I\u2019m curious if you would provide us sort of what you think your long-term target, or long-term average would be, and what benefit that might generate to net interest income? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Yes, we'll get you the where, what, from, to, but, historically we have been over 50% in terms of utilization. And if I recall, we\u2019re in that 45% range today in terms of utilization. So we still have room to go in terms of what it ultimately gets to. So I guess 45 minus 170 where we work, whatever that finance is. Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Fair enough. And I guess just a bigger picture question for Grayson, I guess your consumer loans at this point are about 38% of total loans, those would come on, presuming there was normal levels of demand at higher rates than you would normally see for commercial loans. How are you thinking about the dynamic over the next couple of years of growing the consumer loans and what benefit that might have to the margin over time and sort of how the portfolio ultimately balances out between consumer and commercial. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Yes, I mean I think that David and I have publicly stated a number of times we\u2019d love to see, the mix of commercials to consumer loans more in that 50/50 range, since we have been saying that over the last three or four years it\u2019s hardly moved. Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Today the consumer portfolio is about 38% and that\u2019s in spite of the fact that we reentered the dealer indirect business. And we repurchased back our credit card portfolio and reentered that business. I do think we are encouraged by some of the progress we are making, quite frankly the loan demand in the consumer sector still is less than in the commercial segments. But we are still very much committed to grow on that consumer portfolio. We think that clearly the consumer has taken a much more disciplined approach to credit today. And we think that\u2019s a good thing. So do believe we have almost 4 million consumers would bank with us. And we do believe that penetration into that book of credit products are still low relative to what we see in other peers, and we do believe over time, that we will be able to move the mix of consumer and commercial loans on our book, has just given in this market, with where loan demands at today, that\u2019s become particularly challenging. But we do believe over time that our efforts will prove to move that number directionally towards that 50-50 basis, but that\u2019s going to take some time. And it\u2019s going to take a stronger consumer driven market to do that. Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Good morning Marty. Marty Lacey Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Wanted to ask you David, a little bit about the net interest margin and the two factors that we haven't talked about yet, which are the higher cash balances in liquid assets that you accumulated quietly finally over the last year, you've accumulated about $1 billion, which, in my calculation, is about 2 basis points on the margin that you kind of have in your back pocket, that you could use whenever you so deemed necessary. So, how do you think about that, and what plans do you have to deploy some of that? David J. Turner Jr.: Marty, you are right our cash balance, average cash balance did go up during the quarter, and there is a big driver that is our continued growth in deposits which we are always out there looking for good customer deposits. We realized that we need to put that cash, to work more efficiently which we will do. We would like to be down in that, maybe just less than $2 billion range in terms of cash balances today, given that lack of a efficient functioning over night market. So you should not see us continuing to pile up cash at the Fed and continuing to see an increase that you did this past quarter. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: And that\u2019s a positive that you didn\u2019t get this quarter that you forget in the future and the positive that you did get this quarter was the decline in premium amortization which although rates went lower, I guess cash flows and prepayments stayed low enough that you were able to reduce that amortization this quarter. David J. Turner Jr.: Yes, that amortization was helpful to us; it was a positive in terms of our net interest margin. The benefit that we see going forward us they are slowing of premium amortization is less and less. There is still some positives there. So we just have to think efficiently how we put the cash to work, you spot on is just where do we put it, it\u2019s the most meaningful to us. We probably have loan growth and to fund loan growth appropriately priced, appropriate risk-weighted loan growth that\u2019s what we are here for and if we can\u2019t do that we put it in the investment portfolio while we weight. I think that\u2019s the question about deleveraging, we look for opportunities there ourselves when the economics make sense. So there are a couple of different places we can use the cash. We just have to find the most efficient needs of it. Marty Lacey Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC : And, Grayson, a big-picture question. When you're looking at the risk management practices that you're investing so heavily in, there's one thing which says you have to comply with all the regulatory requirements. But what is going to make Regions different? How do you see the actual, tangible benefits of having better risk management? And all the things you're doing just being compliance, or we really making our risk management better? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: So, Marty it\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s one the entire industry is asking our sales, if it\u2019s compliance for compliance sake I think you miss a great opportunity. In this organization, we are trying to grow risk management all the way down to the front-line, making sure that our first line of defenses from risk standpoint are solid, our second lines are solid and third lines are solid. And we are driving a very strong cultural change to the company around risk management. At the end of the day in investment, we are making a risk management has to make sense from a business perspective. It has to improve not only quality of our earnings, but the consistency of our earnings I think that we are trying to strike a healthy balance. We are in the business and taking risk, but we are in the business to take improvement risk, and so I think that the question we ask ourselves everyday is not how we invest in risk, and compliance, and audit just for the sake of being in compliance, but really for how that we really change our company to make it a better company, to make it a company that is a better long-term investment to our share holders and a better long-term place for customers to bank and for our team members to be involved. And I\u2019ll just ask Matt Lusco. Matt\u2019s our Chief Risk Officer right here I think it\u2019s a great question Matt want to comment on it. C. Matthew Lusco : Hey, Marty I\u2019ll add to that, over the last six months the loan was $59.2 billion and that\u2019s really just more fine, really don\u2019t consider operational loss and consulting costs will back our lost revenues from opportunity costs. That\u2019s an incredible number compared to net charge-offs in the industry, it\u2019s only $20.7 billion. You really do have \u2013 have to have an infrastructure to manage that. We got an initiative and Regions if we talked a little bit about in the annual report this year called Regions ROA, which stands for Risk, Ownership, and Awareness and that really is ensuring that we are building out strong partnership between first and second line of defense. And Grayson said, not compliance for the sake of compliance is to ensure that we are getting the maximum benefit out of all of our processes. We are identifying some internal costs of non-compliance. We want to track down the information is really measured, so we figure it is really a comprehensive quality insurance initiative. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Thank you, Marty. Marty Lacey Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC :  Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Good morning Sameer. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks, good morning. I just had a couple of questions. So the first one was, you provided some good commentary around loan growth being somewhat broad-based. And I was just curious in terms of your loan commitments, it looks like last quarter they increased by $500 million. And if I'm doing my math correctly, it looks like this quarter, loan commitments grew by $750 million to $800 million. And I was curious if that increase in loan commitments this quarter, and indeed the loan commitment themselves \u2013$750 million to $800 million. If you could speak to the mix of those commitments, where are you seeing, perhaps, increased demand? I know you had some growth, finally, in industrial real estate. Is that a significant chunk of the loan commitments this quarter? Or any other specific areas you might point to, as far as the loan commitments go. Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thanks, good morning. I just had a couple of questions. So the first one was, you provided some good commentary around loan growth being somewhat broad-based.

Is that a significant chunk of the loan commitments this quarter? Or any other specific areas you might point to, as far as the loan commitments go. David J. Turner Jr.: I think as you look at \u2013 you look to loan growth this quarter, while it was the first quarter is a long time, we say a net growth on investor commercial real estate. The good news on net growth was that, while still multifamily is that largest single product out of that production, we did see strong production on the other parts or other categories of commercial real estate, which about 40% of our production is in multi-family, 60% of our production was elsewhere scattered between single family industrial office and retail. Retail still continues to be sort of a smallest part of that production but if there was more growth there than we\u2019ve seen in previous quarter. I think when you look at the commercial industrial; we really see that growth in a lot of our specialty lending groups in particular energy and healthcare. And if you look across markets, the markets in Texas and South Louisiana are growth completely strong but also we had pretty decent growth in Georgia and in north-central Alabama. And of course Florida, while Florida, probably at the most challenging coming through the rescission. We\u2019re seeing some really positive signs coming out of certain markets in that part of our franchise. John Asbury you like to add that? John Asbury : Again there is some more growth in commercial continues to be strong for us pretty well diversified. One thing I like to see this quarter is that kind of general industries geography based commercial effort was actually the single largest driver of commercial loan growth which is good and so we still had very good performance on the specialty lending areas but it\u2019s nice to see more of a broad based general industries, you already spoke of the geographic areas from where they came. No question we\u2019ve been increasing commitments on the real estate side, to your point pretty well diversified, not just our product title, we are seeing, improving diversification, but also we are seeing improvement in diversification of where we are financing of this products on the real estate side as well. So that good to see that coming on line. Sameer Gokhale :  Okay, thank you. And then just here in terms of the auto business, you talked earlier about dealer penetration. And you mentioned that you are in 25% of the dealers that are really in your footprint, so there's an opportunity out there. Do you have a metric? How high do you think that 25% could go in the next 12 months, like some sort of target? And in terms of the average loans per dealer, I think in 2013 the average loans per dealer grew by more than 50%. And I think you referenced, in Q1, that increase was more like 13%. So is that kind of the run rate we should expect over the course of this year as well, as far as average loans per dealer? Just to get a sense for a couple of metrics there, and how you're thinking about the next 12 months. Thank you. Janney Montgomery Scott LLC :  Okay, thank you. And then just here in terms of the auto business, you talked earlier about dealer penetration.

So is that kind of the run rate we should expect over the course of this year as well, as far as average loans per dealer? Just to get a sense for a couple of metrics there, and how you're thinking about the next 12 months. Thank you. David J. Turner Jr.:  So as we think about indirect, you are right. With 25% of the dealers in our geography, we are looking while we have 6,000, obviously if we go at, and we really want to be particular with the dealers that we do business with. So our strategy now is less about increasing that number as it is penetration of our existing dealers. You referenced the increase in the number of deals per dealer per month increasing we have done it one. So the average was one deal, per dealer per month, and that is up quite nicely. The reason it was only one is, remember we reentered the indirect market you have t come back and build the relationship that takes time. And as we\u2019ve proven ourselves and proven our technology and our service to our dealers, we see penetration increasing at the existing 2,000 dealers that we have today versus growing that number. And we do that by the service and we do that by the speed of answering that we get back to the customer, which is driven by enhancements of the technology that can help us that determine an underwriting decision much quicker than manual intervention. So that\u2019s really the strategy going forward. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Yes, I mean our goal is not to have, we are not going to measure necessarily the numbers of dealers that we have signed up, but the quality of those relationships, and we want to sell deeper into those relationships and how more meaningful banking relationship with them. And so what you should expect to see this year is more transactions or per dealer basis and less emphasis on just rolling numbers dealing. Sameer Gokhale :  Okay, great thank you. Janney Montgomery Scott LLC :  Okay, great thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron of MorningStar Equity. Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research :  Hi, good morning. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Good morning Gaston. Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research :  Hi, just wanted to go back to expenses for a second. Just two quick things; one is on occupancy. So, with the number of branches coming down, how should we think about that line going forward? David J. Turner Jr.:  So occupancy is one of our top three costs, that we continue to look at and you are right to point out that a lot of our occupancy cost is in our branch infrastructure. We have right at 1,700 branches. We continue to evaluate all of those we consolidated 30 auctions last quarter, equated that in this quarter. And so there are ways to tighten that up some I would not accept dramatic changes in our occupancy as a result of that, but we\u2019ll continue to chip away at that line item. A lot of that cost of occupancy is fixed cost; depreciation on places that we have, leases or whatever. So the ability to drastically move that without exceeding leases and taking a one-time charge is less for us, but we continue to look at that closely. Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research : Okay. Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, lastly on expenses. You really kind of held the line here on salaries and benefits, in looking at the five-quarter trend. How should we think about that line, assuming that eventually you move into a higher revenue environment? I mean how much sort of pent-up pressure is there for increases and things like that? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Well, there are some of the salary and benefits that are tied to revenue. So as revenue increases you should except to see an increase in salary and benefits to pay for that revenue. We are down in headcount through the first quarter. Some of that is just timing related. But we focused on making sure we rationalize our total head count, which we will do over time this year. There were some benefits that we received through our pension accounting during the year. And so, you\u2019ll see that continue to play out through 2014. Our commitment, as we stated that front, was really to ensure that we\u2019re shooting for generating positive operating leverage. And so, we are as concerned about the increases in salaries and benefits or any other expense line. As long as the revenue generation is there to take care of what ever increase that we have. So there is some variability with those expense levels tied to revenue. Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Steven Tu Duong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking our call. Just a quick question. Regarding your loan portfolio, your commercial real estate mortgage owner-occupied, that continues to decline. Is that still part of the de-risking of your portfolio or is there more that we can take from there? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: No, that\u2019s really not part of de-risking. If you look at the owner-occupied real estate, it really performs pretty close correlation to the C&I portfolio in general. And so, it \u2013 but what you\u2019re seeing there is just a continued maturity of those notes in the pace of still what\u2019s soft demand for that particular product. I think as sort of economic courage returns on the part of some of our business customers, you\u2019ll see that improve, but right now that is still a softer part of our lending segments. Steven Tu Duong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. So we should \u2013 as the environment improves, we should expect that to eventually reverse course, I take it? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: That\u2019s correct. Steven Tu Duong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, great. Well, I appreciate. That's all for us. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Good morning. Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Hi. Thanks. Couple of quick questions. Pardon me if I missed this one in the call. Your consumer advanced product, what is the dollar amount of outstanding in the yields on those loans? David J. Turner Jr.: I think we haven\u2019t disclosed our total outstandings, or revenue, I should say generated from Ready Advance. And the reason for it is we\u2019re in the process transitioning out of that into different product that we are testing as we speak. And we want to make sure we give you investors the best information on what that revenue change if any will be as a result of those new products that we are transitioning into. That will take for 2014 to transition. And so if we get more clarity on that, we will be happy to share that with you. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  And clearly there is going to be a revenue adjustment. We are working through what that means for us and what our transition plans are. We have not been adding customers to this product since the first of the year. We are seeing just normal attrition in that customer base. And within that product, our transition strategies are either yet to be proven out and as we did a little more maturity around that transition process, we will be able to give you a little more clarity on what we think the impact will be. Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. One more question. LCR \u2013 ultimately to get to \u2013 I know you don't need to get to 100% right now, but ultimately to get to that \u2013 will you need to shift the mix of securities a little bit towards more of the level 1? Or where do you stand, especially if you bring the cash that you've got sitting at the Fed now? David J. Turner Jr.: We are trying to address that a little bit in the prepared comments that we relieved based on the rules today. And our interpretation of those rules, we will be compliant with LCR when it\u2019s implemented. So relative to others, we don\u2019t have a lot of changes in terms of portfolio. Changes that will affect us that being said we need to continue to see how it rules change over time. And we will make corrections. But based on what we see today you shouldn\u2019t see a big change in our portfolio later. Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG partners. Christopher W. Marinac \u2013 FIG Partners LLC :  Thanks guys. Grayson, you'd mentioned earlier in the call about the smaller markets you have, and the interest in trying to expand over time. I was curious if any of these small markets are popping up today, as pockets of good loan growth and opportunity that in terms of what you are already realizing. David J. Turner Jr.: We have all different kinds of markets in our 16 state to impress. Each market offers a different competitive advantage or different opportunity I should say for us. So some of the smaller markets we have products and services that should make the customer base. And many other small markets the stability of deposits is really important to go back to questions asked earlier, what happens when rates increase and economic activity starts occurring and deposit become all more important as your funding source. And perhaps today we\u2019ll count on the small markets where we have some really dense small markets that we think are really beneficial to us. That being said we have markets where we\u2019ve tried to get that density that we need or to get our products set sold through the market. If that can\u2019t happen, then we will consolidate like you\u2019ve seen us do. And we'll look to continue to rationalize our footprint over time as a result that we can\u2019t get the revenue streams that we desire from them. Christopher W. Marinac \u2013 FIG Partners LLC : Great, David. Thanks for the color here. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. David J. Turner Jr.: Good morning. Matt D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey David, it\u2019s afternoon. I realize the credit card book is only about $1 billion, but what's the thought process for offering credit card to non-customers? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.:  Matt, if you recall, we \u2013 it\u2019s not been that long ago that we repurchased our credit card book and then it took a few quarters to yet that book converted over to our systems and to get processes in place. And so, we really have been focused since that time on really penetrating our book of business and today about 14% of our customers have our credit card. We\u2019d love to see that come up to more corporate level where you see some of our peer groups in the 20% to 25% range. We\u2019ve been doing that and doing that more effectively each and every quarter. We\u2019ve seen most recently some numbers where we obviously are getting much more proficient and selling into the financial needs of our customers and offering that product. We have been also trying to determine how best to grow the number of customers that bank with regions. And so, within our footprint we elected the sort of cash to market to see if there is a way to use our credit card product offering to attract new customers into our offices. We\u2019re already in that process. There\u2019s no intention on our part to be a heavy solicitation bank in terms of card, but very targeted, very selective in markets that we dominate where we have strong brand name recognition. We\u2019re trying to extreme it to see whether we can really drive some customer traffic into our branch offices for new accounts. Matt D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Okay. That makes sense. And then just as we think out over the next few years, I want to say, at one point you thought the card portfolio could get up to a $2 billion handle. Is that correct or is that the thought process in terms of how big it could get over time? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Your math is just as good as mine. We\u2019re at 14% penetration. If we can get into that 20% to 25% participation rate, we ought to be able to double size that portfolio. But more importantly is that we can offer our customers a more full financial relationship, because all of our customers are going to carry one or more credit cards. We\u2019d love for one of those to be ours. And our goal is to be able to manage that customer relationship, which we think gives us a better chance of creating more customer loyalty, better retention rate long-term for that customer base. Matt D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Okay. Thank you very much. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.: Thank you. I think that ends our questions and we appreciate your interest and your time today on this conference call. And we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Paula, and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only, at the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. List Underwood : Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Our presenters today are Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we\u2019ll be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation. With that said, I will turn it over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today we reported earnings of $292 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Overall, we are pleased with our results, which reflect our steady progress as we continue to effectively execute on our business plans. Total revenue was diversified among product lines and increased 2%. Meanwhile, our adjusted expenses decline, improving our adjusted efficiency ratio 270 basis points, 64.2% and importantly, our number of customers and quality households increased again in the second quarter. We are continuing to build on our solid foundation by focusing on the fundamentals. This quarter we grew loans, deposits and checking accounts. In addition this quarter, we were able to increase our shareholder dividend to $0.05 per quarter. Through the first half of 2014 loans increased $1.9 billion or 2.6%. Business lending had delivered strong growth this year, which has become more broad-based geographically and by industry time. We are seeing momentum in our upper middle market sector as companies are beginning to demand credit, the competition remains elevated in this lending segment. On the consumer side, credit card and mortgage balances increased and indirect auto portfolio continue to expand. Growth in indirect lending portfolio was driven in part by process improvement initiatives instituted earlier this year. These initiatives improve loan processing automation and increased pull-through rates on loan closings. As a result, sales production per dealer has increased 18% in the first half of 2014. Across the organization we are focused on driving process improvement to reduced variability, improve processes and performance, and accelerate efficiencies and effectiveness. As with indirect auto example, our efficiency initiatives extent beyond expense reductions and also focus on ways to enhance revenue, we currently have several initiatives underway to optimize loan processing, enhance the customer experience, develop small business online banking capabilities and much more. We are also continually working to identify customer needs and provide customers with the type of products and services they want and need, while making it easier to do business with Regions. It is the personal dedication from every associate that is making the difference at Regions. This commitments not only from our customer facing associates, which are regularly recognized for their excellent customer service, but also for the back-office support associates who are constantly working to improve our processes, our products and our technology. While the economic environment continues to improve and recover, we are staying focus on the things we can control. This quarter\u2019s decline in interest rates makes topline revenue growth even more challenging. However, we are committed to our prudent credit standards in order to increase revenue. As a result, our asset quality continues to improve, as net charge-offs, non-performing loans, trouble debit restructurings declined in the second quarter. In order to create a more streamlined corporate structure focused on execution, we recently realigned our business units and geography leadership creating a general bank with consist of businesses and serve retail wealth management and business. And a small bank and a corporate, which consist of businesses that serve middle market and large corporate plants. Importantly, we believe this realignment creates a more effective model for executing our business strategy, managing our performance and most importantly, serving our customers. To close, we are pleased with this quarter\u2019s results, but we realized we must continue to remain focused and find ways to optimize our franchise in order to create long-term shareholder value. I will now turn it over to David Turner, who will cover the details of our second quarter results. David? David Turner : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s take a look at the detail starting with balance sheet. We achieved another quarter of steady growth as loan balances were up $833 million or 1.1%. Notably, both our business and consumer lending portfolio grew as total loan production increased 22%, reflecting an improving economy. The business lending portfolio totaled $48 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 1% from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by commercial and industrial loans, which grew $888 million or 3%. C&I growth was led by our general industries group within the geographies, as well as our asset base and specialized lending groups. In particular, our technology and defense group achieved solid growth. In addition to the seasonal impact we typically experience in the second quarter, we are seeing an increasing number of commercial customers utilizing loans and lines to fund working capital, general financial needs and to some extent M&A. C&I loan production increased 26% and loan -- line utilization increased 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Meanwhile, commitments for new loans increased $1 billion. While ending investor real estate balances were down slightly from the first quarter, average balances were up. We expect to benefit from some incremental growth over the remainder of the year in this important loan category. Total consumer lending increased $206 million linked quarter and represented 38% of our total loan portfolio at quarter end. The growth in the consumer portfolio was led by indirect auto lending. Both balances and production increased 5% from the prior quarter. With our focus on process improvement and a positive outlook for auto sales, we expect continued growth in this portfolio. Credit card balances increased $28 million or 3% from the previous quarter. This increase stems from a 14% increase in spending volumes and a 3% increase in new credit cards sales. We expect balance growth to continue over the remainder of the year. Mortgage balances were up modestly this quarter, as production increased 31% linked-quarter and applications increased 18%. Also mortgage prepayments typically linked to refinancing activity slowed from the previous quarter. Originations continue to be driven by new home purchases and represented 76% of total originations. Total home-equity loan balances declined $84 million as loan payoff continued to outpace new production. Total home-equity production increased 32% from the previous quarter. Importantly, as customer\u2019s home values increased, they are taking advantage of both the fixed rate home equity loan product, as well as the variable rate home equity line product. Our direct consumer lending portfolio totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter. We currently have several new initiatives and products under development that we anticipate will further expand this portfolio overtime. Looking ahead, based on what we know today and reflecting our current economic forecast, we continue to expect 2014 loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range. Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Deposits continue to grow increasing by $429 million during the second quarter. Similarly, low-cost deposits grew by $697 million and continue to account for the majority at 90% of total deposits. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels and totaled 11 basis points, while total funding costs declined to 31 basis points in the second quarter. We continue to expect 2014 deposit growth to be in the 1% to 2% range for the year. Let\u2019s take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $837 million, an increase of $6 million. The resulting net interest margin declined 2 basis points to 3.24%. Net interest income was positively impacted by loan growth. However, this improvement was offset by lower asset yields and loan spread compression, resulting from the persistently low rate environment and competitive pricing pressures. Regions has been able to maintain a relatively stable margin, primarily due to improvements in deposits and borrowing costs, and due to the decline in rates that has persistent. Looking forward, we expect some modest net interest margin compression in the 5 to 7 basis point range. However, we expect to be able to grow net interest income concurrent with loan growth. We remain asset sensitive and expect to benefit from increases in both short and long-term rates. Therefore if the improvement in economic conditions translates into an increase in rates, we would anticipate lift the both net interest income and net interest margin. Let\u2019s move on to non-interest revenues. Total non-interest revenue increased 4% to $457 million in the second quarter. Service charges increased 1% from the first quarter, aided by an increase in checking accounts in the first half of the year. In addition, service charges are typically seasonally lower in the first quarter. Card and ATM fees increased 6% from the previous quarter. Debit card transaction volume increased 8% from the first quarter attributable to higher spending and the growth in checking accounts. Credit card income benefited from a 3% increase in sales of new credit cards, as well as spending increase. Now with respect to our ready advance product, as you recall, we discontinued offering this product to new customers in late January and existing customers will be phased out by the end of the year. While we were in this trial for short period of time relative to some of our peers, we learn how to offer small dollar credit to our retail customers in a more effective manner. We will take this knowledge and build on our commitment to providing all of our customers with credit solutions that meet their needs. But we don't know how many of these customers will avail themselves of our credit products, just to help you frame it up, the contribution from the ready advance product on a pretax basis was approximately $6 million this quarter. And to remind everyone, we have successfully dealt with many legislative challenges that have impacted our non-interest revenue to a greater degree than the ready advance product, which gives us confidence in dealing with these changes looking forward. Let\u2019s turn to the expenses. We continue to focus on controlling expenses and our results reflect those efforts. Adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $827 million in the second quarter, down 2% linked-quarter. Salaries and benefits declined 3% from the first quarter, the majority of which was related to lower payroll taxes and benefits. In addition, year-to-date, we have reduced overall headcount by 839 positions or 3.5%, primarily driven by new branch optimization staffing strategy and the impact of recent branch consolidations. Deposit administrative fees declined $9 million, primarily related to our refund from previously incurred fees and going forward, the run rate is expected to be similar to that of the first quarter. Although, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 64.2%, we remain committed to driving continued efficiencies across organization. We continue to expect full year 2014 adjusted expenses to be lower than those of 2013. Let\u2019s move on to asset quality. We continue to make progress in the second quarter as many credit metrics improved. Net charge-offs totaled $67 million, which represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $35 million or $32 million less charge-offs. Our non-performing loans declined 16% linked-quarter and inflows of non-performing loans declined 8%. At quarter end, our loan-loss allowance to non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 137%. In addition, total late stage delinquencies declined 2% and total debt restructurings or TDRs declined 15%, driven by payoff and paydowns. And while total criticized loans increased from the previous quarter, classified loans continue to decline and just to be clear, the results of the shared national credit exam have been reflected in the results for this quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point in cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected. Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at end of the quarter stood at 12.5%. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.6%, an increase of 20 basis points from the previous quarter. We estimate our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio to be 11%, well above the minimum threshold and liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%. Importantly, based on our understanding of the proposed rule, regions remain well-positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio. Now, in summary, our second quarter results continue to build on the momentum established earlier in the year. We believe that by focusing on our customers and by creating products and services that meet their needs, we will grow our customer base, deepen existing relationships and strengthen the communities in which we operate. Furthermore, we continue to create and foster an environment that attracts and retains top talent, allowing us not only better serve our customers but also successfully execute on our strategic priorities, all of which we believe will ultimately create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will now turn it back over to List for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. List Underwood : Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now, let\u2019s open up the line now for your questions, operator. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI. Keith Murray - ISI: Thanks. Let me just spend a minute on trends behind the service charge on deposits, basically flattish quarter-over-quarter, down a little year-over-year. What\u2019s going on behind there? David Turner : From a service charge -- Keith, this is David. Honestly seasonally low in the first quarter, generally picks up in the second. We have had couple of things going on. First of, we are growing accounts which is encouraging. The customer behaviors have changed as well. From what we see, the customers are being more careful with how they manage their accounts and that\u2019s reflected in some of the negative in terms of our service charge line. We think the right thing to do is continue to create products and services that our customers need and will value. That is pay for what they get and we believe the way to continue to increase those service charge line item is through the customer growth that we are seeing and we have our -- all of our associates focusing on growing that line item. Keith Murray - ISI: Thank you. And then just on the loan growth guidance, it looks like you're calling for a little bit slower growth in the back half of the year versus the first half. Where are you seeing little bit of decline in momentum category wise? Grayson Hall : I\u2019ll answer and then I\u2019ll ask David to expand on it. We forecasted loan growth in sort of 3% to 5% range and we still feel that\u2019s an appropriate for us to forecast that at this juncture. We are seeing credit demand more broadly than we\u2019ve seen in the past, which has been an encouraging improvement. I would just say that we have seen increased competition in that space as well, both from banks and non-banks. And so it is that activity is taking place, we still believe that we\u2019re doing a great job of getting in front of customers, our bankers are some of the best and we\u2019re winning lot of the business but given what we\u2019re seeing now from both the demand and a competition standpoint, we still believe our forecast is in line. David? David Turner : Yeah, we started, Keith, the first quarter, really strong start with several conferences and were asked why we\u2019re in the 3% and 5% range when the run rate clearly would imply much larger. One quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, two quarters didn\u2019t quite make a trend either. But as we look out and we see the demands for credit, larger corporate demand, still not seeing quite a small business demand that we\u2019d like to see and we\u2019re still cautious about being beyond 3% to 5%. We want to make good loans, profitable loans. We are saying no more today than we have been as a result of some of the competitive pricing pressures and structure -- structures that we see. So right now, we still think 3% to 5% is a right number. We'll see what happens in the third quarter and update that on the next call. Grayson Hall : Pipelines are robust. We still feel good about the pipelines. To David\u2019s point, the production even in the small business sector has been good, it\u2019s been encouraging but it hasn\u2019t resulted in lot of growth in outstandings because of payoffs and paydowns. But we still see -- continue to see awful lot of deleveraging taking place out of bank debt. And while the demand is picking up and we feel bullish about where the economy is going, we still -- we still are concerned about the level of competition and the level of alternatives for some of our borrowing. Keith Murray - ISI: Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks very much. Grayson Hall : Good morning Eric. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the forward-looking statements. With respect to your operating expense lines, if we were to simply annualize the first two quarters here, we\u2019d end up achieving the guidance. So I guess my key question on this is should we expect incremental improvements from the second quarter $827 million level? David Turner : We\u2019ve -- as I mentioned in our prepared comments, we continue to focus on expenses every day given the challenges in growing revenue. Our guidance has been year-over-year guidance which we want to stick with right now. But every line item that you see in and a lot of line items are underneath what you see in our public financial statements. We are working hard on every single one of those. Obviously, the driver on expense management -- the number one, our largest category is our salaries and benefits, occupancy. We continue to look at furniture and fixtures. We look at -- but we\u2019re having savings in some areas and investments in others. We've invested an awful lot in regulatory compliance, given what\u2019s going on in our industry and but I think we can continue to become more efficient. Our efficiency ratio was down quite a bit from last quarter. We have given guidance that we would continue to work to the lower 60s over the year. How low we can go, we\u2019ll have to see. Large -- a big part of that\u2019s really the revenue side of the equation versus expenses. Grayson Hall : And obviously also David, we\u2019re clearly focused on positive operating leverage and while we\u2019ve given guidance to our expenses this year to come in below last year\u2019s final number. We are focused on trying to deliver prudent growth and to the extent that this growth were to exceed our expectations than obviously some of the compensation around that would also increase. But right now, we still feel good about our guidance. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : On the service component, is there incremental headcount reduction to come or is that largely through at this stage? Grayson Hall : I would say the majority of the headcount reductions that resulted in the rationalization of our branch staffing and also rationalization of the number of branches. Those who were in the numbers today but we continue to look for efficiency opportunities across the company and still confident in our ability to driver those efficiencies out. So incrementally, there are still opportunity and -- but the parts you saw coming out of first quarter, it had a lot to do with some of the branch rationalization work we do. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And if I may sneak in one more, can you -- I heard your comments on the asset quality outlook but how specifically should we think about the adequacy of the provision at this level down into the 1.4% range? David Turner : You\u2019re talking about the allowance. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Correct. David Turner : We have a pretty sophisticated model that as we go through the exercise every quarter in terms of, determine -- determining what the allowance needs to be. We will continue to follow that. You know, as credit quality continues to improve in particular non-performing loans, TDRs and charge-offs gives us more confidence that the allowance level can come down some as well. Where that terminal value is, it\u2019s very difficult for us to come up with. We had originally given you guidance on a range of 1.5% to 2%. We think we can go south of that number given the improvement of our credit quality. But we have been reluctant to peg exactly where we think that can get to because it\u2019s really depends on what our model tells us. And so we\u2019re going to stick to that. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. If I could follow up on the net interest margin outlook for down 5 to 7 basis points, I guess first to clarify, is that combined down 5 to 7 basis points for the back half of this year? David Turner : That\u2019s down from where we\u2019re right now back half of the year. That\u2019s correct. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, so in total over two quarters potentially down 5% to 7%? David Turner : That\u2019s right. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then I guess just bigger picture, why is there the margin pressure? I guess if I look at short and medium-term rates, they haven't really changed. Obviously the tenure has come in. Is it some of the bond premium amortization or is it loan pricing or is it just that the shorter end of the curve hasn't moved up at all or all of them? David Turner : We expected the short rates to be where they are. Long rates we have expected to rise a little bit towards the back half of the year, still do but the tenure persistently lower. If you look at LIBOR, LIBOR is down lower as well. So -- and I think it\u2019s just this continued reinvestment that we are having to make with our cash flows in the lower rate environment that continues to put pressure on net interest margin. That being said, we continue to grow loan portfolio like we think we can. We think net interest income can grow commensurate with that loan growth that we will have. So from a competitive standpoint, we have -- we've been relatively stable from a margin standpoint. I think our peer average that we track were down about 6 points this quarter. And we've done relatively well but at some point we\u2019ve got to -- it's going to catch up to us from a NIM standpoint. We've had deposit growth that we need to deal with, which is a good thing but you have extra cash flows put to work, some of that sitting at Federal Reserve where you don\u2019t get a lot of carry and they actually work against you from a NIM standpoint. So I would be overly focused on the NIM but we are going to have the challenges just like everybody else will have and our focus is really on growth of net interest income line. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, that's helpful. And just separately, the deposit advance product, that has gotten a lot of focus and I think at $6 million a quarter, is materially less than people were fearing. Remind us is that included in the service charge on deposit? And if so, has there already been a little bit of decline in that product which is why the fees are flat or down $1 million year-over-year? David Turner : That\u2019s right. Matt, it\u2019s all in the service charge line and so that\u2019s a result of discontinuation of new clients coming in January. Clearly, there has been some runoff there. That is reflected in the first and second quarter service charge line items, clearly a bigger impact in the second quarter than the first given our timing. So that\u2019s a little bit -- that may get little bit to Keith\u2019s point that he started with those service charges as well. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller - FBR: Yeah. Thank you very much. On the troubled debt restructuring, your TDRs, we know that there's a pretty hot market for that stuff right now and some of your competitors have been selling assets into that. I know you sold some a couple quarters ago, but I don't believe you sold any this quarter. Can you give me some thoughts -- are you just going to just let that portfolio run off or is there opportunities to sell that at some pretty good prices today? David Turner : I think Paul if you look at the transaction that we had for the fourth quarter, we closed it in the first. It was unique. We felt given that pool of assets and pricing for that particular pool was the right thing for us to do. We continue to evaluate opportunities to sell assets, TDRs, when the economics make sense. And when the trade that makes us work, we\u2019re not going to do it just to unload troubled debt restructurings. If you look at our TDRs, there\u2019s a disproportionate amount those that are paying us as agreed and accruing. We just have them in TDR classification because they met the definition of restructuring at the time. We do think that in particular in the commercial side, we\u2019re seeing credit improve. You can see that in our metrics from classified to criticized assets as loans continue to improve and they've been upgraded to better categories. And so overtime, we think some of those TDRs will be payoffs. Again, they are paying us as agreed so there will be pay offs, there will be pay downs. And there will be some -- it just get better and upon renewal, those could go into different classification. So it\u2019s really about three or four things working there to help us improve TDRs, but it\u2019s all about -- the number one driver is asset quality improvement. Grayson Hall : Will and Paul, I think additionally we look at the relationships we have with these customers and many of these customers may be in a TDR status, but they are paying as agreed and they have a deep relationship with our company. And so we take that into consideration. But to David\u2019s point, we continue to look at this category, that's on our balance sheet and try to make the best decision for what\u2019s best long term for the company and our customers. Paul Miller - FBR: And you don't take -- I mean you do take more of a capital charge with the TDRs, would you rather take that capital charge if you can maintain a customer? Is that what basically you\u2019re telling me? Grayson Hall : I mean, I think to David\u2019s point, we look at the economics and the economics is not only of the trade, but the economics is the value of that relationship on an ongoing basis. Paul Miller - FBR: Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : Hey, good morning, guys. So just to ask Eric's question a little different way. When we look at expenses in the back half of last year, there was a pretty big ramp. So I guess assuming your base case of 3% to 5% loan growth, assuming that does happen, should we expect to see a ramp from the current levels or do you think you can continue to keep expenses close to where we are today? Grayson Hall : So if you recall last year, Ryan, we were investing quite heavily in our wealth management initiative and we had hired a number of people towards the second half of last year really to get that initiative up and running and we made a lot of progress on that, but that initiative is funded today. And so depending on what the opportunities are in the last half, we can\u2019t predict those. Right now, we are pretty pleased with where we stand from a staffing standpoint and absent any unforecasted opportunities to bring more talent into the company, we are going we think where we need to be. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Then Grayson, just on capital, unless I missed it in the release, you guys have one of the highest capital ratios of your peers. And it looked and if unless my math is wrong, it doesn't look like you guys used much of the buyback at all. Yet last year if I remember, you used over half your authorization right out of the gate. So can you just talk your decision to hold off on the $350 million or so buyback? I think we've seen a couple of others out there who have been constructive on the back half of the year utilizing large chunks early on, so I would be interested to hear your view on using capital. Grayson Hall : Yes, absolutely, your memory is good. Last year we\u2019re fairly early in the process of executing buybacks. And this year we submitted the capital plan that\u2019s different than year. We think we\u2019ve done the right thing for our company, but it is a different plan than we executed last year. David? David Turner : Yes, I think, Ryan, we -- let me just go through kind of steps on how we think about capital, clearly we want to get our dividend up. We want to use our capital for growing organically. We want to use our capital after that for growth of portfolios, growth of businesses, whether they be banks or non-banks and when that manifests itself to return it to shareholders. So we submitted our capital plan early January based on our third quarter of last year. It\u2019s been a while and we put in there specific capital actions that we would like to engage, including the timing thereof. And without being too specific, we are executing according to the plan that we submitted to our regulatory supervisors that didn\u2019t receive an objection. So you know what our buyback is, we made that public and we will execute according to that plan. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : Got it. If I could just sneak in one other quick one, I know you noted that the SNC exam was in this quarter's results. I do think some of us were surprised that we did see a 24% increase in the special mentioned loans. Was this driven by the SNC exam? And if not, can you just give us some color as to what drove the quarter-over-quarter increase? David Turner : Well, we can\u2019t comment specifically on regulatory activities. I tried to put that in my prepared comments that the results from that exam have been incorporated and what you see in our numbers. You also as you look at the classified and criticized schedule, it\u2019s in our supplement. You will see the improvement classifieds moving some of that improvement moved into special mentioned. So net, net if you look at them together, we are up I think about 2%. We are still encouraged by the path of our credit quality. There is nothing that cause us to believe that our credit quality is turning to go the other way which I think is really what your ultimate question is. Grayson Hall : As these credits migrate, you are going to see more credits move into that special mention category as that particular credit recovers. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Good morning. Grayson, I want to ask kind of a strategic question. When you're looking at potential kind of pockets of further recovery, I look at the excess capital that's been built and it's continuing to go higher. You've got excess liquidity to deploy at some point and you've got the rate sensitivity that's sitting there. Can you just talk a little bit about strategically how you think of these three things and how you are wanting to use those for the best benefit of your shareholders? Grayson Hall : Yeah, I think Marty as David was trying to articulate just a moment ago is that we\u2019ve made a conscious decision to try to position our company in this way. We think it\u2019s to our strategic advantage to position ourselves this way. We do know that we\u2019ve got some excess capital relative to peers. We do think we still have pockets of recovery that is still occurring in the markets that we operate in and in the portfolios that we have owned our balance sheet. We think that every quarter puts us in a little bit better position and still confident and encourage by the progress we are making. That excess capital, excess liquidity is certainly something we discuss and work through from a strategy standpoint. I think that as we put together our capital plan for this year, we try to weigh those opportunities and what we thought timing of those kind of opportunities might be in. And we put our plan together accordingly. So if those growth opportunities don\u2019t occur as we thought or don\u2019t occur on the timeline we thought, we will make adjustments as we go forward, but right now we are pleased with our position. I anticipate questions on this issue, but we still remain pleased with where we are at. David Turner : Yeah, Marty, I will add, from an excess capital standpoint, this gives us maximum flexibility to do some things. We realized that whatever those things might be don\u2019t manifest themselves that we can\u2019t continue to pile up capital and work against our return metrics and the fact that our common equity cost is still much higher than we want it to be. So we get the message. We know we have a plan for getting that deployed in a meaningful manner going forward. From an excess liquidity standpoint, we are sitting here with loan deposit ratio of 82%. We do have this new thing coming called the LCR, liquidity coverage ratio that we all need to be very careful on what that means to our industry. It is a big change, and of course we don\u2019t have the final rules, but we feel confident based on what we see today that we are going to be fully compliant with that. But that will have a different liquidity profile when it\u2019s implemented than we do today. And so we need to be careful there. From an interest rate risk standpoint, we are continuing to be asset sensitive. We would love for rates increase some. Unfortunately given the economy, given a lot of geopolitical issues we don\u2019t know that we will see that in \u201914. We think perhaps we see that in the latter part of \u201915. That being said, we think our balance sheet positioning is the right thing for us at this time. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : The other thing I was going to just kind of big picture is efficiency ratio. You've made a lot of progress in getting that down from like 70% into the low 60s. Traditionally the low 60s has kind of been where Regions has kind of plateaued so you've made a lot of progress even compared to historically where you've been with the ability to show at least when revenues pop on rising interest rates. So it just seems like to me the operating leverage is getting to a point where you could probably squeeze that pretty tightly and you're waiting on that next round to kind of get you down towards the 60% range. David Turner : Yeah, I mean, Marty I think we work very hard. We made pretty solid progress on improving operating efficiency of the company and a lot of progress on the expense side of the income statement. We\u2019ve done a lot of things in terms of rationalizing our workforce and rationalizing our fiscal infrastructure. We reduced several million square feet of space, so we focused on a lot of process reengineering to take a lot of the labor out of different processes. So we feel pretty good about what we -- we feel encouraged by what we have done on the expense side. At the same time we face some pretty big challenges in terms of revenue generation. There have been a number of regulatory and legislative activities that challenged our other revenue side of our income statement. And so if you look at our challenges today, it\u2019s much more apparent on the revenue than on the expense side. All that being said, we still are spending an awful lot of time and still finding opportunities to reduce expenses in our company and we will continue to do so. But we likewise are spending an equal amount of time trying to figure out how we generate revenues inside our company. Obviously an increase in interest rate would be very helpful to our revenues, but today we can\u2019t depend on that, we can\u2019t expect that to happen quickly. So we are finding other ways to do that. And we are growing households, growing accounts, and growing the debt of our relationships, our customers and then start to make a difference. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Hi. Good morning, Grayson. The first question just a follow-up on the service charges. Thank you for quantifying the deposit advance. So I was wondering if you could just help us walk through those changes in behavior that you've seen in other parts of the service charges and maybe how much is related to changes on the overdraft side and then also just your further expectations about trying to help us size overdrafts. And hopefully we'll get them someday, this expected rules what type of potential impact we are still looking at there? Grayson Hall : Well, I think it\u2019s a -- it maybe a challenge to our revenues, but I think it\u2019s a good news for our economy. We\u2019re really seeing much more financial discipline out of the consumers which are banking with us. If you recall back several quarters ago, we\u2019re predominantly a free checking provider and we went to fee eligible. So 97%, 98% of our accounts today are fee eligible based off of balances or transaction activity hurdles. And what we are seeing is people are managing to those requirements and doing a better job at that today than ever before. So they are carrying higher balances and we also are seeing customers who are avoiding overdraft activities. And so you are seeing better personal discipline around that. It\u2019s interesting you see the same thing on the card side both the credit card and debit cards, spending is up, strong double digits on those cards, but balances on the credit side continue to be modest. So we would just continue to say that the economy of the consumer appears to be getting stronger and the financial discipline around those customers appears to be better. As a result, a lot of the fees that we typically would have seen are not as strong as they were, but I actually think that\u2019s a good news and I also think that it bodes well for when deposit gathering franchises become valuable again. There will be a point when interest rate comes up and our ability to gather deposits is really the strength of this organization. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. And then secondly on the wealth management side, I just noticed two of the three lines looked pretty good but the third line, the biggest one, the investment management trust fee income was a little light sequentially and year-over-year. So I just wonder if you can give us an update on either specifically what impacted that this quarter and also your take up and relative growth expectations for that wealth management business looking ahead. Thanks. Grayson Hall : Yeah, Ken, I would tell you that the wealth management line item that you refer to was down a little bit. I would say there is nothing systemic there that we can grow that and expect to grow that. We do that by executing our Regions 360 approach, which is making sure that our bankers that are out there with customers are taking the folks in our trust area to their client to continue to grow that. It has been slower than we want, but we really have a pretty good focus on Region 360 and expectations on our sales folks to perform consistent with the shared value and the Regions 260 playbook that we put together. So we do think that that will get back on track and growing. It was down just a little bit so nothing really systemic. Operator : Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity Research. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : Hi. Good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Gaston. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : Just had a quick question to follow up on the issue of competition for loans. Just curious are you seeing the nature and I guess the strength of competition play out any significantly different this time than during other previous cycles that you've been through? And is there anything particularly unusual about how the competition is sort of ratcheting up here compared to other times that we've seen this sort of thing happen? Grayson Hall : Yeah. I can't really say how differently this is from other cycles necessarily. I think this one still is playing out, but what we\u2019re seeing is that given the liquidity in the market, given the interest rate environments that in particular are upper middle market, corporate type credits help a lot of alternative, the public capital markets being one of those alternatives in. So we\u2019re just seeing more customers taking advantage of the environment we\u2019re operating in. And I think a longer it goes on, the more competition we\u2019ll see. And so underlying all that is incrementally more credit demand than we\u2019ve seen in the past, we still are seeing strong pipelines for new business, but the competition around those relationships is as strong as I\u2019ve ever seen. And an awful lot of pressure on our bankers to get out in front of those customers and try to convince then the value of our relationship, but no doubt, there is a lot of competition, a lot of alternatives today. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : Okay. Fair enough, thanks. And then just very quickly as a follow-up, I know you talked about some margin compression in the second half of the year here and I hear what you are saying about focusing more on growing NII than just looking at the margin. But just to follow-up on that, I'm just curious -- I mean I don't know if it's too early to look into the first part of 2015, but would you have any expectations that after this pressure in the second half here that things might stabilize on the margin front in kind of the early part of 2015 or is it just too early to say? Grayson Hall : Well, your two questions are more interrelated than you might have initially thought because I think that when you look at the credit quality or the credits that we\u2019re putting on the books today, it\u2019s some of the best. I mean a lot of our corporate customers, they have an awful lot of liquidity themselves and less debt than they have historically carried. Their balance sheets are in much better shape. And so they\u2019ve got a lower -- from our standpoint, they\u2019ve got a lower risk rating, a better credit quality picture and can demand better pricing on credit. So as long as the economy continues to improve and as long as the credit quality of our borrowers continue to improve, it\u2019s going to keep placing pressure on the margin as new loans come on the books and you saw that compression in our own loan yields this quarter. And I think that just sort of continues as long as we\u2019re sort to own this glide plan. Hopefully, at some point in the future we start to see the interest rate environments modestly change upward. Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Good morning. My first question is just on the LCR. As we look forward to the rest of the year and you think about balance sheet actions related to LCR compliance, do you just plan to remix your current securities cash flows into HQLA? Or should we expect the balance sheet to grow faster in the back half of the year? And also, does the NIM outlook for 5 to 7 basis points, does it include any impact from LCR friendly balance sheet moves? David Turner : Hey, Erika, this is David. Our NIM outlook incorporates all activity, all actions that we would take. From an LCR standpoint given we\u2019re well positioned, we have a relatively large securities book today. We have reinvested some of our cash flows into different investment classes like Ginnie Maes. We have a corporate bond portfolio. We\u2019ll recirculate some o those cash flows out of that portfolio into Ginnies and other high quality liquid asset. So you should not expect a significant change in our makeup, especially relative to some of our peers. And that\u2019s a little bit of the beauty as to where we are with regards to our loan deposit ratio and the size of our securities book relative to some others. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Got it. My second question is just a quick follow-up on credit. If we think about encouraging loan growth signs, improving loan demand from here, as well as credit that continues to improve, but we\u2019re probably along the bottom. How many quarters away do you think we are in terms of provisions starting to match charge-offs? David Turner : Yeah. That\u2019s a really interesting question. You say we\u2019re here bumping along the bottom. I will say we\u2019re encouraged by where our credit metrics have gone, but we expect them to continue to improve somewhat, the pace of which is a little uncertain. But today, we\u2019re at 35 basis points, 62% of our loan book is commercial, our business services I should say. And so we think there's a room to continue to come down and it\u2019s that pace of charge-offs that ultimately dictate how much reserve release we have and what ultimately our reserve levels need to be. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve quite gotten to the bottom of the bump along just yet. And so I think look at one thing, look at what our NPLs do, what would our inflows do and what would our charge-offs do to give you better information as to what a go forward level might be. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Okay, helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning, Grayson and David. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, you mentioned that you are getting a little bit more demand for underwriting of home equity loans. Certainly make sense given the data that we have seen in terms of the improvement in home equity values. But I guess I'm just curious if you could give us a little more color as to how you are underwriting those and if there's any regulatory guidance that is being imposed on you in terms of trying to reduce the future rate shock on those -- on the HELOCs? Grayson Hall : First of all, we have seen a shift in our equity product line. We have both the line of credit and are fully amortizing equity loan product. You\u2019re seeing a shift where there is more production now in the line product than loan product, that\u2019s been a recent shift. I think an awful a lot of the loan production historically has been interrelated to refinance. In particular, the people who have small dollar mortgages, relatively small dollar mortgages and so as that refinance activity is going away, some has debt production. And so the line product is, you\u2019re seeing more production out of it. That production has been helped by the home appreciation values that we\u2019ve experienced over the last several quarters, but still being very conservatively underwritten and much more conservatively underwritten than what you have seen previous to the economic recession. And so we\u2019ve changed a lot of our product features, as well as changed a lot of our pricing around those features. And we in addition have changed a lot of our underwriting criteria in terms of loan to values. And as you look at the quality of that book and I can't state it off the top of mind, David may can, is that loan-to-value ratios are very solid. The credit scores we\u2019re seeing on it are north of 700. And we have the product does begin amortizing. I believe if I\u2019m right, it\u2019s a 10-10 product, 10 years interest rate, 10 years of amortization. And so we feel good about the product that we\u2019re underwriting from a regulatory compliance perspective. And I think the new LTV is averaging around 60% on new production. David Turner : Now I\u2019ll add a couple of things. We were a little different then most of us going into this -- into the recession relative to this product where we had basically a 20 year IO. We stop that to have a 10-10 product, as Grayson mentioned. The benefit, if you will, of having that is if you look at Page 13 of our supplement, you\u2019ll see the future maturities of the home equity lines of credit we broke it down in first and second liens. And you can see what the resets are. They really don\u2019t even start until 2019 and the bulk of these are in 2026. As a matter of fact if you look at 2014, our resets are $128 million, $195 million next year. So we don\u2019t have the payment shock issue in the near term like some others have. I also point you to Page 11 in the supplement, where if you look at our credit quality, our improvement was pretty noticeable with regard to our home equity product. In particular, if you look at second lien improvement terms of charge-offs, so that product performance is very well. The credit quality has been well. Our pricing of that product before the changes when we grew the portfolio, we\u2019re little challenging and as we use to prime minus a half and prime minus one, so that\u2019s been our bigger issue versus credit quality more payment shocks. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. Thank you for that information and then just in terms of the -- a number of your competitors have mentioned this quarter about not just looking at net interest margin particularly on the commercial relationships. You have to -- we in the analyst community have to look at the broader relationship and the fee revenue component that each relationship brings in. But if I look at that in terms of just the second quarter and maybe this is too short a view, year-over-year capital markets fee revenue was down a little bit year-over-year, commercial credit fee income is now down a little bit year-over-year. How are you thinking about growing those types of fees to improve the overall profitability of your corporate relationships, presuming rates don't really move up much before the end of 2015? David Turner : Yeah. That\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve continued to make investments in our capital markets group for that purpose to continue to bring in new clients for us. We have new capabilities in terms of underwriting there that we started about a year ago. And I think if we stay focused to capital markets fees, while we\u2019re focused on that, the interest rate environment is a big driver. A lot of those fees are really driven by some of our derivatives we sell into the market. Interest rate swaps to be more specific. And we have rate environment that is as low as it is with no real expectations for increases. Clients are reluctant to lock in, so they will just take the interest risk themselves. That will change in time and when it does, you\u2019ll see that manifest itself in our capital markets income. We have other income streams. We continue to work on, you mentioned the relationship. This is maybe the single most important thing to take from our company is we are relationship bank. We have Regions 360, which means taking our entire bank to our client base. Not just -- you cannot be just a credit only shop. We have other products treasury management, capital markets, whatever the case -- insurance. We have other lines of business that our customers can use. And so it's really understanding the needs of our customer base and taking those lines of business and product and services and delivering those to the needs of the customer. That will be the differentiator for us over the long haul. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. In terms of your loan growth, you gave us some color that you expect loans to grow in that 3% to 5% range and you talked about competition more recently being very strong. I guess the question I have though is your commercial real estate portfolio, both the investor-owned and owner-occupied, which has always been a strong part of your business, continues to steadily decline. It's not just this quarter of course as you know and I know you were derisking the portfolio and that program I was under the impression was completed. So I guess is what's happening to that portfolio as it continues to shrink? Is it something you just want to be smaller in that business or what's going on there? Grayson Hall : Not at all. I would tell you that production on investor commercial real estates has been pretty strong. And we continue to believe there is opportunities to grow that portfolio. We\u2019d obviously got to do that prudently and thoughtfully. And -- but we\u2019re out finding ways to grow that portfolio everyday. The owner-occupied segment of that, just for clarification is heavily influenced by small business and medium size businesses. And a lot of this is the facilities that they\u2019re operating out of and that portfolio continues to amortize and to pay down over time. We got lot of work that we\u2019re trying to do internally around those particular lending segments to try to encourage that and we\u2019re seeing good production. But I would tell you all the customer segments we look at that small business, that small to medium-size business has been sort of late to recover late to come back and have a lot of demand for credit. The stronger demand is up in the upper middle market, larger corporate customers and has been -- and the consumer has been fairly strong, especially, in the area of auto. But that\u2019s small to medium-size business, while, were seeing their production, we really still need to see to get a really healthy economy, really need to see that customer segment strengthen a little bit more and develop a little bit more confidence to invest in their businesses and that\u2019s predominantly driving that owner-occupied category. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. And regarding -- I know you guys have touched on the capital. Obviously your Tier 1 common ratio is very strong at 11%. If I recall in CCAR, your CCAR stress test I think reduced your Tier 1 common ratio by about 280 basis points and since 5% is obviously the bogey everybody has to get to, I would think most banks would want to stay around 8.5% not to get anything close to that 5% in CCAR. What is your guys' thinking on where that Tier 1 common ratio should get to? I know you've got different strategies of how to use the excess capital but I am more asking at what level do you think you should be at under a normalized environment when rates come back a bit and maybe growth picks up a little more? David Turner : Gerard, this is David. So you're right on the stress basis that we've -- if you look at our portfolio makeup at that time, we think that our improving credit metrics is part of it, our TDRs. There are elements about our balance sheet that consume more stress than we have in the past. If you look at where we think Tier 1 common could go and Basel I, you would be in that 8.5% to 9% range. And clearly we\u2019re well above that. That goes back to the excess capital question that was ask by Marty and how do we really get that deployed in the most efficient -- most effective manner. So we\u2019re looking at alternatives today and but we do think we have capital to spend on host of things not only total capital. But we need to optimize our capital stack in terms of making sure we have the proper amount of common and proper amount of non-common Tier 1 as well. So there's still such things that we\u2019re working on to get capital levels and the stack optimized. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Do you -- not to pursue what those strategies are but is there a timeframe that you think you could get to an 8.5%, 9% level? Is it end of \u201816 or is it sooner or later than that? David Turner : You that\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s a little harder to answer. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll snap the fingers and get to that level over night. I do think it\u2019s something over time. I think the first thing we want to do is not continue to accrete capital at the level and pace of which as to what we\u2019ve been doing and to get that deployed in the more effective manner. So let\u2019s do that first and then look at what -- what options are out there for us to take advantage of with our capital mix. We think that gives us a lot of flexibility to see how things transition in our industry to be -- allow us to use that capital. And so I don't want to make any commitment as to -- really the level I gave you, kind of a rough range but I certainly don\u2019t want to give you a timeframe. It\u2019s -- we need to leave that open-ended. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator :  Your next question comes from Richard Bove of Rafferty Capital Markets. Grayson Hall : Good morning Dick. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets : Good morning. This has been a long call so if you want to do this offline that's fine. But I was wondering if you could go through the process in this auto sector. We had this article in the New York Times last Saturday. It was pretty negative and what I am thinking about is are you adding new car dealers or used car dealers? Are you letting the dealer underwrite the loan? Are you checking the premium that the dealer is putting on the rate? Are you looking at the price of the car that is being sold relative to some kind of Blue Book situation to determine whether the dealer is gouging the customer? I mean, how do you -- how are you approaching this whole new process in the auto sector? Grayson Hall :  I think the, clearly, the lot of attention on this particular customer segment and we spent a lot time on this segment from a compliance perspective and in fact we have -- we've actually reduce the number of dealers that we are operating with. We had -- it\u2019s in our disclosures but we actually have reduced the number of dealers we are dealing with by about 300 -- approximately 300. So we are going through and rationalize which dealers that we are getting healthy amount of business from and getting it in a correct manner. Lot of dear oversight, lot of dealer monitoring around rates and spreads, and adjustments for those rates and spreads, and so you will continue to see us elevate our monitoring capabilities of that segment to make sure that we are adequately addressing compliance issues. In addition we use a lot of third-party reviews. Third parties to come in and look at that, compare the numerics and make sure that we understand exactly what's going on dealer by dealer and loan by loan, I will be glad to have some of our team who is working on that full-time to give you more detail around that. It\u2019s -- but it\u2019s a complex endeavor and we are investing time and energy in there to make sure that we are doing this in a responsible way. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator :  Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of KBW Chris Mutascio - KBW: Good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Chris. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask the provision question, maybe a little differently, David, if we could? Did the inflection in the loan loss provision expense this quarter have anything to do with the spike in the special mentioned category? David Turner : I would tell you that what -- our allowance model certainly takes into account our risk ratings that we have which would include special mentioned substandard so forth. So, by definition, if these incorporate in our provisioning and allowance levels that we established. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Your final question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John. John Pancari - Evercore: Good morning. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry for the long call here. But back to the deposit fees, I guess, this goes back to Ken's question, which you might have been looking at -- getting at is, have you been able to quantify a potential impact from check order processing changes, I know you have made a big step in helping us with the quantification of the deposit advance product, I wanted to see if you've got a similar quantification on the sequencing? Thanks. David Turner : John, this is David. We continue to see how this issue is going to evolve. We know this has been pushed off a little bit. It\u2019s probably a late \u201815, \u201816 issue. We are continuing to do what we think is the right thing to do buy our customer. We\u2019re going to test the few things starting in the first part of 2015. Because its not just check order processing or debt processing order, it\u2019s got deposits, it has funds availability, there are whole host of things that are had to be considered in this and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint specifically what it -- would mean. Now what we do believe as we learn from our -- some of our test in the first part of \u201915 and as we get batter guidance we will share that with you, but we don\u2019t see this being an impact in \u201915 as much as it might be in \u201916 and that\u2019s depended on whether not to come up with further guidance. John Pancari - Evercore: Okay. Thank you on that. And then, separately, on the excess capital discussion, can you just give us a little bit of your thought process around, if M&A is part of your plans and is that potentially more focused around business acquisitions or loan portfolio acquisitions or could it be whole bank deals? Thanks. David Turner : Yeah. As I\u2019ve tried to mentioning our thought process, I\u2019ll go through the beginning of it, because it\u2019s important to know our full way of thinking is, we got dividend some and we continued to challenge, to make sure we have a faired reasonable dividend, given the limits in guidance by our regulatory supervisors. We then look to deploy our capital organically, growing earning assets at our company. We also look to use that for acquisitions of portfolio like we did our credit card portfolio couple years ago. We look at non-bank transactions that would give us sources of revenue without utilizing a lot of capital that would help us from a diversification of revenue stream and we look at and have a whole teams looks at bank as well. If and when that ultimately comes back, so we are going to prepare ourselves for that type of transaction and when all that doesn\u2019t work then we will return that excess capital back to the shareholder in prudent manner and subject to capital plans and no objections from our regulatory supervisors in the CCAR process. So, I guess, the short answer would be, yes, it is included, but that\u2019s the order that we think about in capital form. John Pancari - Evercore: Okay. Thank you. And then lastly here, any -- on the commercial real estate front to help support growth there, any possibility there or any thought process around extending the duration a bit of your CRE paper that you're putting on the books in order to drive volume growth, for example, competing more aggressively with some of the permanent financing players for example? David Turner : We\u2019ve talked about whether or not that\u2019s viable for us to date, we have not done anything to extent that duration. You can see our kind of what our portfolio looks like right now and it really is depended on what type of risk adjusted return we can get on this product. What our stress capital looks like on this product. And so, I think that, if we really look that that the first place we would look is really in that owner occupied real estate space where we have a little different client make up, as Grayson mentioned earlier, usually a smaller business that has put up real estate as collateral out of an abundance caution in many cases and we are willing to take a little bit of duration risk with that. But I can tell you to date we have done a lot of it. John Pancari - Evercore: Okay. Thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. David Turner : Okay. Grayson Hall : I believe that\u2019s our last question. We appreciate everyone your time and attention today. Thank you and if there is any questions after the call feel free to call List Underwood and Dana Nolan. We will be glad to take your call. Thank you very much for being here today. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paula, and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. List Underwood : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call today. Our presenters this morning are Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other members of our management team are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of the call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation. I will now turn it over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today we reported another solid and consistent quarter with earnings of $305 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Total revenue increased 2% and asset quality remained solid with a net charge-off ratio of 39 basis points. We continue to focus on meeting the financial needs of our customers and once again this quarter we grew our customer base and deepened relationships, as evidenced by growth and quality households and quality checking accounts, all of which are fundamental drivers of long-term sustainable growth. Although the overall lending environment was challenging in the third quarter, we remain committed to maintaining disciplined credit underwriting standards. Competition remains intense within the business lending, creating pressure on both price and structure. Nonetheless, we remain prudent on how we choose to compete the loans. As a result, there are number of deals that we are walking away from that do not meet the company risk appetite or have unacceptable terms. While we experience slower demand in July, August, recent trends indicate a very favorable pickup in activity and have generally been more favorable both at the end of the quarter and as we enter the next quarter. The consumer lending portfolio continues to expand, including growth in indirect loans, credit card and mortgages. Additionally, our deposit base continued to increase, with the pending deposit balances up $308 million from the prior quarter. We remain focused on growing and diversifying our non-interest revenue. Despite the challenging environment, we believe to align customers to bank the way to choose is a key to customer satisfaction and growth. We also recognize we must continue to innovate as it is critical to attracting and retaining customers. We are committed to driving long-term growth while improving efficiency across the organization supported by process improvement initiatives. Despite the recent market volatility and global macroeconomic weakness, we are encouraged by improving economic fundamentals throughout our core markets. Although the recovery remains uneven, we expect increased capital spending activity will drive GDP growth in 2015. Finally, we are encouraged and been pleased with the recent analysis of positive actions by couple of our credit rating agencies. We believe these actions reflect meaningful improvements in the number of credit quality metrics and our overall risk profile. We are committed to maintaining a strong risk management culture and these rating upgrade are further evidence of our continued progress. I will now turn it over to David for a closer look at our third quarter results and then we will take your questions. David Turner : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the detail starting with balance sheet. Loan balances totaled $77 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $94 million from the end of the previous quarter. The consumer lending portfolio drove increase as growth in business lending moderated early in the quarter, as Grayson indicated. Total consumer lending increased $120 million linked quarter as production increased 2%. The growth in the consumer portfolio was led by indirect auto lending as balances increased 4% from the prior quarter. We continue to benefit from the robust market for auto sales, as well as from the process improvements instituted earlier in the year. As a result, we expect further growth in this portfolio. Credit card balances increased $19 million or 2% from the previous quarter. This increase stems from a 4% increase in active card users. Today our marketing efforts have primarily targeted our existing customer base. As a result, we continue to make progress as our penetration rate is up 200 basis points to 15% over the last year and we expect growth in balances to continue in the near term. Mortgage balances were up modestly this quarter as production increased 1% linked quarter. Meanwhile, total home equity balances declined $96 million as loan payoffs continued to outpace new production. However, total home equity production increased 13% from the previous quarter as customers continue to take advantage of fixed rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit. Looking at business lending. This portfolio totaled $48 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4% year-to-date. Commercial and industrial loans grew $503 million or 2% from the prior quarter. As Grayson mentioned, competition remains intense in this space. In addition, we experienced loan payoffs related to customer mergers and acquisitions as well as refinancing activities occurring in the fixed income markets. C&I growth was led by the general industries group [ph] within the geographies, as well as refinance. Line utilization declined 40 basis points. However, commitments for new loans increased $1 billion or 2% and our pipelines remain strong. Regarding investor real estate. While ending balances were up 1% year-to-date at $6.8 billion, the portfolio experienced a decline of 2% from the previous quarter. Investor real estate remains an important part of our corporate bank strategy, given our market presence in the Southeast. However as previously noted, we remain committed to our risk tolerance levels as it relates to this portfolio. As such, near-term growth is expected to be modest. Based on what we know today and reflecting our current economic forecast, we expect ending 2014 loan growth to be at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range. Let's take a look at deposits. Supported by our multichannel platform, deposits continued to grow increasing $308 million during the third quarter. Of note, low-cost deposits grew by $492 million and continued to account for 91% of total deposits. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels and totaled 11 basis points, while total funding costs declined to 30 basis points in the quarter. We continue to expect 2014 deposit growth to be in the 2% range for the year on a point-to-point basis. Let's take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $837 million, essentially flat versus the prior quarter. However as anticipated, our net interest margin declined six basis points to 3.18%. Net interest income benefited from an additional day in the quarter, as well as from a modest increase in the securities portfolio. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by approximately three basis points due to higher levels of cash and the additional day. Both net interest margin and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower asset yields, as maturities and paydowns and loans and securities are replaced at lower levels. Asset yields are likely to continue to come under pressure if the current low interest rate environment persists. Deposit and funding costs are expected to remain stable at historically low levels with limited opportunity to realize additional cost leverage. Assuming rates remain at roughly current levels through the fourth quarter, we expect to have net interest margin compression of one to three basis points, and net interest income growth will primarily be driven by growth in loans. In terms of our interest rate sensitivity, we remain asset sensitive and expect net interest income to benefit from increases in short term or longer term rates. More specifically, a 100 basis point parallel shift in rates would increase net income by approximately $160 million in the first year. Total non-interest revenue increased 5% to $478 million in the third quarter. Service charges increased 4% from the second quarter and card and ATM fees increased 1%. Credit card income benefited from a 2% increase in spending volumes. Now with respect to posting order, as we previously stated, we plan to begin following a chronological approach in select markets during the first quarter next year. The results from these tests will be used to inform our posting order process and customer communications. We do not expect to fully implement these changes until the second half of 2015. However, through our current modeling efforts, we estimate the impact from these changes to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per quarter. It is important to understand that the modeling assumes a static environment, and there are numerous policies including funds availability that impact fee revenue. Mortgage income was down 9% from the previous quarter, primarily related to lower mortgage servicing rights and related hedge income. Although servicing income has been relatively consistent, we continue to look for opportunities to grow this revenue source. We currently have approximately $40 billion of mortgages in our servicing portfolio and have the operational capacity to take on additional volume. While mortgage production declined in 2014, the pace of our decline has less than the industry. Originations continue to be driven by new home purchases and represented on average 73% of total originations this year. And looking ahead, the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that mortgage origination should increase 5% to 10% in 2015, and we expect to continue to outpace industry estimates. Capital markets income increased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily related to an increase in activity in real estate capital markets. This increase reflects the revenue increase from investments we have made to expand our capital markets capabilities. Let's move on to expenses. Adjusted expenses were flat from the previous quarter. Salaries and benefits increased $13 million from the previous quarter as headcount increased 183 positions. The majority of these positions are in revenue-generating or revenue support roles and include hires in specialty lending, insurance, wealth management and platform personnel and will drive future growth in revenue. The remaining portion of the increase continues to be primarily from hires of support staff, particularly in risk management and compliance functions. With that said, we continue to closely monitor personnel resources which has resulted in a reduction in headcount of 656 positions year-to-date. Credit expenses have been particularly low for several quarters, as we have benefited from loan sales out of our held-for-sale portfolio. The opportunity for gains will diminish as the balances in the portfolio decline. This quarter, we also incurred expenses related to Visa Class B shares sold in prior years which resulted in $7 million of additional expense in the third quarter. Furniture and equipment related expenses increased primarily related to investments in technology, including systems enhancements and data management solutions. Additionally, we benefited from a recovery to expenses related to unfunded commitments of $24 million, which was primarily due to a large credit line that funded that was subsequently resolved during the quarter. The adjusted efficiency ratio improved by 60 basis points to 63.6% in the third quarter, as we remain committed to driving efficiencies across the organization. While some quarter-to-quarter volatility is to be expected, we continue to expect full year 2014 adjusted expenses to be lower than those of 2013. Moving on to asset quality. Our overall asset quality remained solid as many credit metrics improved in the quarter. Our nonperforming loans declined 7% linked quarter. In addition, at quarter-end, our loan-loss allowance to nonperforming loans or coverage ratio was 141%, up from 137% last quarter. Total delinquencies declined 4% and troubled debt restructurings or TDRs meaningfully declined 7%, driven by both refinancing activity and paydowns. In addition, both criticized and classified loans declined from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs totaled $75 million, representing 39 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $24 million or $51 million less than net charge-offs, and based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point in cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected. Let's move on to capital and liquidity. We continue to maintain industry-leading capital levels. At the end of the quarter, our estimated Tier 1 ratio stood at 12.7% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.8%. Further, we estimate our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio to be at 11.2%. As previously mentioned, we expect to begin executing our $350 million share repurchase program shortly as we previously planned. And just a quick note regarding preferred stock expense for the third quarter. due to the timing of our April issuance, the first coupon period was longer than future coupon periods and resulted in additional expense of approximately $4 million. Going forward, with the current level of preferred stock outstanding, the run rate for preferred stock expense will be approximately $16 million per quarter. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid, with a loan to deposit ratio of 81%. And regarding the liquidity coverage ratio rule, Regions' funding base and investment portfolio are well-positioned to receive optimal treatment based on the high quality liquid asset definition. Importantly, our Regions 360 approach supports deepening customer relationships, which provides an LCR friendly platform for the ratio calculation. Overall, we are pleased with certain adjustments made to the final rule, and expect to be fully compliant by the January 2016 deadline without meaningful changes to our balance sheet. In summary, our third quarter results continue to reflect our steady progress in growing revenue, while maintaining a disciplined risk culture. We believe that by focusing on our customers' needs while prudently managing risk, we will drive long-term sustainable growth and deliver long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. List Underwood : Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session. In order to accommodate as many of you as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and then one related follow-up question. Now let's open the line for questions, operator. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Paul. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Good morning. Hi, it's actually Jessica Ribner, in for Paul. How are you? Grayson Hall : Hi, Jessica. Good morning. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Good morning. It sounds like, just from your comments, you sound more positive about 2015 than 2014 in terms of loan growth and earnings. Do you feel like you can improve on today's loan growth into next year? What are you guys seeing? Grayson Hall : Well, as you look at third quarter, we said in our prepared remarks, we saw a moderation of loan demand in the July and August and then we saw loan demand strengthen to some degree in September. We continue to see that strengthening of loan demand into the fourth quarter. Certainly, we are encouraged by that. I would say the moderation in the early part of quarter was a mixture of both the number of merger and acquisition transactions where we either were not the bank of the acquirer or we were the bank of both and had to reduce our hold positions on those. But we also saw an overall reduction in demand and the related production as a result of that demand. And so there were a number of one-off transactions that we would not have anticipated in terms of payoffs or paydowns, but I would say, generally, in July and August, we saw reduced demand. That obviously concerned us early in the quarter but it restrengthened in September. And if the trend continues, I think it is a very good sign for 2015 and obviously gives us the opportunity to perform at a higher level if that trend continues and at this juncture we have no reason to believe it will not. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning. Hello. Grayson Hall : Yes, good morning. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. A couple of questions on the overdraft. You indicated that based on the testing that you have done, that starting third quarter of 2015, you would expect to see $10 million to $15 million drop in your OD fees. Could you give us some color behind the analysis you did to get to that estimate and maybe also indicate what the total OD fees are and let us know if you are going to be offsetting any of that revenue shrinkage with other actions? Grayson Hall : Well, I will start and then I will let David add to that. We spent the last several months making a number of fairly significant modifications to our deposit systems in order to accommodate posting order changes as well as to accommodate the testing and forecasting of those changes. All of those modifications have gone well and we are in a much better position today to understand what the implications of these changes might be. We will start piloting a number of these changes and in general, without getting too deep into the details, our approach is very much of a chronological-based approach to posting and our early numbers would indicate, as David said, that we could realize $10 million to $15 million a quarter reduction in service charges. That being said, you know, we realize that it's our job to figure out how to mitigate those service charge reductions. A lot of it is going to depend on customer behavior, but also we are looking at all of our deposit related products on how we price those products and how we deliver those products and we continue to believe that as we have in the past, as we make changes like this to find ways to mitigate those leakages, if you will, of non-interest revenue. We had a good strong and honest revenue quarter this quarter and so we think we are making some of the rights changes. David? David Turner : Yes, Betsy, we really wanted to put something out there on posting order. It's a question we get frequently. It is based on running some models today but we really need to see what the customer behavior is going to be before we know and we will update you when we know. But we want to frame it up a little bit for you and just try to hit off the continued question there. I will tell you that, through a lot of changes that have happened in our industry, we have had almost $400 million worth of revenue taken out of our company that we have had to overcome and we created new products and services and we will do the same thing here as well. So the team is working hard to grow our revenue, regardless of changes that we see whether it be posting order or other changes we have to deal with. And so we don't have specifics on this just yet but we will continue to update you and find ways to mitigate this revenue and we will give you, as we get closer and run the pilot, we will give you better information to hone in on this number. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Yes, I guess, just if you can share with us anything regarding some of the assumptions that are behind the $10 million to $15 million. Is it a reduction in fee waivers? This is obviously a less bad number than some folks had been wondering or estimating out there. So I am just wondering if you could help us with some of those details? Grayson Hall : Well, I think that clearly, as we went through our most recent assumptions and testing that, we have assumed a pretty static environment and that we are not putting assumptions in the model today that would be indicative of customer behavioral changes. We are assuming behavior to continue the way they have. We are not putting assumptions in there that we have less account attrition which is a potential. If this policy for some customers will be perceived as more friendly then you could argue that there is some account retention benefit, but we haven't modeled that in. So I think we have taken a very conservative approach to how we have modeled this. That being said, the best numbers will come when we actually pilot this in the first quarter and that pilot is really going to give us a much clearer view of that. I think that the primary issue, in our part, is being very transparent with our customers, making sure that we understand how this impacts customers and making sure that we don't lose our momentum in growing accounts as we have been throughout 2014. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Hi, good morning. I was just wondering about the buyback. Is your intention to utilize the full $350 million in buybacks over the remaining two quarters of the CCAR period? Grayson Hall : That's what's in the plan, yes. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and then switching gears to the ready advance. Could you update us on how much the ready advance fees might have been in the third quarter? I believe it was $6 million [ph] PPNR in the second quarter. And how does that trend in the third? And what's the time line for that going away? David Turner : Yes. So the change in the third quarter and the second quarter, a pretty similar numbers that we had previously spoken about. By the end of the year, we will have converted everybody or stopped the ready advance program. Really by the end of November, we will have discontinued that. And we put forth other options for those existing customers in the ready advance product that they have today. Grayson Hall : If you have you recall, we stopped offering the product in January of this year. And we are going through a couple of conversions. We broke the customer base up into segments. We are going to do a couple of conversion, follow those conversions to be completed before the end of the year. And I would say that, the drop off you saw from first quarter to second quarter was predominantly because of reduced enrollments. We took enrollments to zero. The drop off you saw. Really, from second to third quarter had to do with some limited amount of conversions. We still have, of the customers that we had in that product, probably 60% of those customers are still active today, but all of those customers will be converted, as David said, nearly end of November. None of that will be in our run rate for the first quarter. There will still be a limited amount in our run rate for the fourth quarter. David Turner : Yes, in that product. Grayson Hall : In that product. David Turner : But they will be taking other products and then we will have loose revenue from NIR up into NII and that will be based on adoption rates for those customers. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and that should happen partially in the fourth and then again in the first? David Turner : Yes. That's correct. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and then just to clarify Betsy's, on the posting order changes, we assume that $10 million to $15 million. We should start that in the third quarter of next year? Grayson Hall : We will have very limited amount in the first half of the year and the rest of that, the balance of that will be in the third and fourth quarter of next year. David Turner : And that's the plan right now. We will learn through our -- Grayson Hall : We will learn through the pilot. David Turner : Through the pilot. So we are giving you the best information we have today and when the rights come back, we will modify accordingly. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Thank you. And one more thing on the buyback, David. Just anything, you mentioned the $350 million buybacks are in the plan. Is there anything that would prevent you from doing that, that you can foresee? David Turner : No. I don't. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Hi, guys. I guess I will circle back on the expenses. Obviously good progress here and as we think about the full year guidance is down year-over-year. You have been down pretty materially year-to-date. So maybe boxing it in a little bit more for the fourth quarter, if you are comfortable doing so, and then thinking about the trajectory for next year? David Turner : Yes, Matt. We are still working on next year. We will update you on that as we get closer towards the end of the year. We have a couple of conferences coming up. We will let everybody know. As it relates to our general philosophy, as you know, we are wanting to generate positive operating leverage. We have one of the lowest expense bases, but that being said, we focus on it quite a bit. That does not prevent us from making investments where we see the need to do that. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we increased positions about 183 million this quarter, and we put most of that in our revenue-producing, our revenue support roles, because we think that's the right thing to do. And at times, you will see the expense come before the revenue. We had the same issue about this time last year where we have tried to indicate we were going to make some investments. We feel very good about that. And so, long-term, we think we are doing the right thing. Grayson Hall : Yes, Matt. We really are trying to take a very balanced approach, both from a revenue and expense standpoint. We realize that there clearly are investments that we have to make to grow and to manage our business better. But there is also opportunities for us to continue to increase the efficiency of our company. And so we take this very balanced approach to it to try to, if you will, fund our investments through savings efficiencies. We have been very aggressive, as you know, over the last several years, in branch rationalization. We do that on an annual basis. We are going through that process now, as we speak. And we are being more rigorous, more disciplined about that this year. Over the past seven years, we have closed a little over 19% or consolidated a little over 19% of our branch offices. You will see us continue to leverage that process to drive even more efficiency through our company. We still believe that branch is a very relevant channel. We are investing in all of our channels, including the branch channel. But we also believe that we have to manage those channels pretty dynamically. And so, as David said, as we get closer to the end of the year, through the appropriate opportunities we look to update you on some of our cost efficiency initiatives. And we realize, in this kind of a low rate environment that we have got to continue to drive that forward. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : As we think specifically about the third quarter expense base of the adjusted $826 million, is that a reasonable kind of run rate or base? Or should we gross that out for the provision for unfunded credit losses that was a credit? David Turner : Matt, we are not giving you -- you have to build your run rate expectations. We only give specific guidance here. But I do think you need to factor in the unfunded commitment because that's a credit, one-time credit, that may or may not recur. And as you can tell, if you look at that other expense line item we have pretty lumpy, and its because of that expense and unfunded commitment. So that's $24 million going one way. We did have the Visa expense of $7 million that went the other way. And that shouldn't be recurring every quarter. But we have had that from time to time. So that's lumpy as well. That's a net $17 million that I think you ought to consider as you evaluate what you think our run rate would be. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Hi, guys. I had a couple of different questions. One is, with the rating agency changes positively, David, do you think you can become a little more aggressive maybe and maybe using excess capital to start pulling down those debt cost and refinancing your debt given the improvement you are seeing there? David Turner : Marty, that's a great question. We look at trying to get more efficient, if you will, from that funding cost standpoint. As you know, we pay a little over 5% after considering swaps, whatever page it is in our supplement. We look at that all the time and when the economics are right, notwithstanding rating agencies, if it makes economic sense for us to do that, we would love to take that out, use our capital, as you mentioned, and have a better run rate going forward. But it has to make economic sense. And as the rates have continued to come down, it's gotten a little less economical for us, but we look at it literally every day. So your comment is spot on. From a rating agency standpoint, we have gotten some improvement now with the rating agencies. And you know, we are looking to leverage hopefully, over time, even better ratings as we deal with our customers and also as we deal with getting our debt structure, if you will, as efficient and low-cost as we can. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : And then Grayson, we talked earlier this year about the strategy of how you are looking at your customers differently, in the sense of what they like, what types of customers they were and you were talking about growing your customer base and deepening relationships. How are you seeing your new approach to the market and the customers as an advantage now to maybe serve a little bit more the underserved mass market in your markets? Grayson Hall : Yes, Marty, as we have spoken before, we are servicing a little over four million households today. We have about a little over five million customers. And we are constantly trying to think through ways that we can be innovative from a product, for delivery standpoint to increase our satisfaction and our delivery of customer needs and we have offered a number of alternative products to try to bank more of the unbanked or underbanked. Obviously, we have a lot of competition in that space. And as you may recall, we introduced a suite of banking products directed right at that segment called Now Banking. And our Now Banking accounts for some 460,000 customers that we have added to that product suite. And we continue to see progress. As you saw from our numbers this time, we are growing households, growing accounts. We have got a number of borrowing segments that are growing as well as our depository segments are growing. We believe we are making good progress. I would tell you, it is early though, as we have rolled out this new strategy. And that I would say we are in the early innings of this. But the progress is good. And recently to try meet the liquidity needs of some of our customer segments, we rolled out a secured savings lending product and already have some 25,000 customers who registered for that product. So we are still trying to innovate in an environment that will meet customer needs. And I think your question is a great question, because at the end of the day, the only way to have a sustainable business is to be able to grow our customer base. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Hi, good morning, guys. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Good morning. David, I was wondering, your comments about, I know this is wrapped up into your general NIM guidance, but can you talk to us about, if rates stay as low as they are, the impact from the 10-year, whether it's on what your go-to reinvestment yields are, where premium amortization was this quarter and where it goes, and any effect on the pension expense for next year? David Turner : Yes, I will start with the last one first. So pension, clearly, is rate driven and we will have seen what that looks like. I would caution you we were, through the low last year about this time and rates kind of spiked towards the end of the year which helped everybody's pension calculation. So it's a little premature, but you are spot on. A lower rate environment does cause an increased net net of pension expense. So we are going to watch that. It's too early to give you guidance on it. It will be embedded in what we give you later on in the year when we start going to last couple of conferences. I think from out from an overall NIM standpoint, rates are lower than what we had anticipated. Right now, we have done a lot of modeling to figure out what that might mean to us. And we have given you the guidance for the fourth quarter in that one to three, which may persist into to the first quarter. So we think we can do that one to three, making even through that first quarter. And I will tell you, Ken, this has been so volatile. We just need to wait and give us a little bit of time and see what happens. If you look at really the domestic economy, everything points to a higher rate environment, but you have to start factoring in the geopolitical issues that are going on, the economies around the world. And so we are in a tough spot. And then of course, what is the Fed going to do over time. So we think, we believe rates will increase at some point, timing of which is uncertain. We continue to be asset sensitive. We think that's the right thing to do. But if rates stay low longer, we will continue as everybody else will have pressure on NII and resulting margin. So that one of the three right now, I think, could carry us a couple of quarters. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: And within that, can you just tell us what the premium amortization number is for this quarter? And is any change to that built into your outlook? Grayson Hall : It is. Our premium amortization did increase a bit over the quarter. We were at about $40 million of amortization this quarter and I think last quarter it was $36 million. So it did you pick up a bit. But that is built into our overall guidance. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay, and then my other question just is about, you have still a couple of sizable loan categories that continue to shrink well past, I think, anyone's original expectations, whether it's the owner-occupied bucket, the commercial real estate mortgage and then the second-lien home equity. Any line of sight in terms of finally getting to the bottom on those categories from an originations versus runoff perspective? David Turner : Ken, let's take owner-occupied real estate. That generally is our small business customer. And small business formation has been down in 2014 quite a bit. And we really need to see and want to see the demand from that customer. It is our bread and butter. It is really a segment that we can demonstrate our Regions 360 that we talked about just a minute ago with Marty's question, and a lot of services that that customer base needs. The problem is, we just don't see that demand. We see reluctance as we talk to those customers in terms of wanting to borrow for expansion, given all the uncertainty that exists, whether its political, whether its domestic, whether its what's going on in Europe, Ebola. All kinds of issues are factoring in into the concerns of the small business owner. So we are going to work really hard. Have been. We are going to step it up even more so in terms of that owner-occupied base to deal with what the main issue is, and that is amortization. Those have a tendency to be term loans that amortize. And so you have to have production going just to stay even. So we think we can slow that decline. In the home equity second-lien, a lot of that has been refinanced away. Some of it's deleveraging by the consumer. We have started to see that pace to decline slower than it has been over the early part of the year. Some of that has gone into our new product, our home equity loan product. And so we think those are the two, we hope over time in the balance of 2015, that we see those declines slow down and that married with the production, we think we can have a reasonable forecast of loan growth in 2015. That of which we will update you on again towards the end of the year. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: For all that color, David, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital Markets. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions. The first one, just to go back to the buybacks, and I was curious about your thinking behind buybacks. Why you didn't buy back any stock, it looks like, in Q2 and Q3? Clearly, you had the authorization in place certainly for this quarter. But how are you thinking about buybacks? You are going to buy back more stock, but why didn't you buyback anything in Q2? If you would just help me think about that, given that loan growth, I don't think it was particularly strong. So were you anticipating faster growth? And how should we think about that? It just seems like you have a lot of excess capital here. A perspective would be helpful. Grayson Hall : I will say a few words and ask to do it. We put our capital plan together roughly a year ago. It was in the fourth quarter last year and we put that capital plan together. We clearly had to make some assumptions around what we thought the forecast for economic activity was going to be. And quite frankly, some of the things have turned out better than we forecasted, some worse. Clearly economy's recovery been slower than we anticipated. Our organic loan growth has not been as strong as we had thought that would potentially be at that point in time. And alternative investments have not turned out to be as strong as we might have liked. That being said, we were very confident in our plan. We felt like it gave us an awful lot of flexibility. We thought it put us in a position to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, strengthen our capital position and we were confident in that plan and we have been executing that plan. And as David said, now we are at the point where we are ready to finish off the task that we had put into that plan. I know there has been some questions about why we planed it that way and why we backend loaded this. But again, we used the best forecast we thought we had and we still are confident that was a good plan. David? David Turner : Yes. I think going into the year, loan growth, if you go back to the first quarter, loan growth was more robust for us. We really want to deploy our capital to grow our business. We think that's why the shareholders gave us the capital to begin with and giving it back to the shareholders is what we will do when we haven't been able to deploy it otherwise. So we put it intentionally in the back half or in the back half of the plan. And we had no objection to that plan and we are executing in accordance with that. Once you build a plan and submit the plan, that's what the plan is. There is not really an opportunity to go back and change that plan easily. So we are going to execute of course with it. And you should see us wrap that up by the first quarter of 2015. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets : Okay, that's very helpful. And then I am going to ask you a question that's more of a high-level question and one that I could probably ask CEOs of other banks as well, Grayson. But what I would love to get your perspective on is that you and other banks have been focused on the efficiency ratio and lowering expenses. And of course I think in any cycle, any given point in time, banks would like to be more efficient rather than less efficient. I think that goes without saying. But having said that, as you think about your business and you think about the environment we are in, it sounds like you might, with your reductions in headcount and this probably applies more generally across the board, it suggests that you and other CEOs really aren't very optimistic at all about growth going forward. And I know the hope is that interest rates at some point will increase and give a top-line benefit. But having said that, from a business planning standpoint, how do you think about continuing to reduce headcount going forward in terms of running the business? You seem to be planning for more of a continued slowdown going forward. Is that accurate? And I would just love to get your thoughts on that. Thank you. Grayson Hall : I appreciate the question. I think it's a great question. I think its one that a lot of banks are trying to answer. I think my answer would be more optimistic than the picture you just painted. I think that, we are seeing the opportunity to grow our business. We are seeing in the markets we operate in, given the strengths of the market that we operate in, we believe we have got an opportunity to grow our business. And we do believe that while the economy is improving slowly, it still is improving. And we are seeing signs of that improvement across all of our markets. I have said it internally and I will say it externally. We have made a lot of progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. I don't believe we have even started to really demonstrate what the power this franchise can be going forward. I think the progress we have made in 2014 really lays a solid foundation for what we could potentially do in 2015. But we are growing customers. We are growing households. We are growing our business. I think the third quarter was slower, from a loan demand, than we had anticipated. But if the trend continues, we are more optimistic for the fourth quarter, knowing what we know today. So all that being said, as optimistic as we all are, we still have to be prudent and I think that we have to have this balanced approach to both investing to grow but looking for efficiencies around the company that allow us to, if you will be, to be able to hedge that forecast. David Turner : Yes. I would add. I do think that the investments in people that we made mentioned, I mentioned that on the comments, roughly 183 during the quarter, but we have done some things to cut back on headcount. So we had consolidated 30 branches. We started that in the fourth quarter last year, finished up in the first quarter of 2014. And when we do that, we have a reduction in staffing levels as a result of that. So that's an example of where we use our excess capital. We would take a charge for that, but then we were able to consolidate, get a reasonably quick payback as we consolidate and take those customers from one branch into another. So just looking at headcount numbers can be a little misleading in terms of what our commitment is to grow our business because we believe our biggest opportunity is revenue growth and we will get that by making prudent investments in people and businesses going forward. Grayson Hall : Well, there is not just people. Our physical footprint, we are down under 15 million square feet. We continue to find opportunities to reduce our physical footprint, by 10% to 15% a year. And we think that continues. We are operating in a smaller physical presence. A lot of our branches are smaller. We have fewer branches. We also are doing the same thing in office space in our back office as we continue to consolidate space and there is number of different examples of the way we are trying to make sure that we get efficiency across the company. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you again. I appreciate your responses. I know I could have asked that of pretty much any CEO, and your perspective is very helpful. And then just a last quick one, if I may. Your capital markets pipeline going into Q4, I know the revenues were up a little bit, but do you see that spend continuing into Q4? Thank you. Grayson Hall : Yes. I think we have made a pretty sizeable investment in people and product in our capital management group and in our capital markets group, and obviously, one of the bigger products in that group is in this interest rate environments, not been there for us. But the I think a little movement in rates and we could see a lot more production out of that group, but nevertheless with investments we have made, we continue to think we are grow the revenue out of that business. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Michael Rose - Raymond James : Hi, good morning. Just going back to the expenses, how should we think about the environmental cost? Are we back close to kind of pre-cycle normalized levels? Are there some more levers that you can pull to reduce some of those costs? David Turner : Well, Michael, we always can reduce costs and build efficiencies. We do that. We have a whole team and that's what they are focused on. Helping each business, each support area, look at how we might improve workflow, it gets harder from where we are. We have worked over the past few years reducing our overall expenses to support our business, but that being said, we can continue to do that. Over time, we mentioned our overall efficiency ratio being with a rate increase in the 55% to 60% area. We are at 63% and change today. We have a group that we invested in. It's a Six Sigma group that is looking for top process improvement to do two things, one to increase revenue and we mentioned that, I think, on our last call, where we have changed process and helped us increase revenue in things like indirect auto. And we have also use them to help from an efficiency standpoint on the cost side. So I think we can always look at how to improved there. We have had changes in our OREO and held-for-sale kind of credit related expenses there. We had some benefits gains on sale that don't repeat. And those are harder to replace. We do focus on consulting expense. We focus on our legal expenses. In all those, we have opportunities to continue to wind down or reduce overtime. Grayson Hall : And Michael, I would tell you, and I would agree with everything that David said, but there is one additional area. If you look at the investment we have made in risk management and compliance, this industry has faced a lot of new rules. And as we have gone through those new rules and regulations, we have used awful lot of human resource to ensure compliance with those rules and regulations and as we have opportunity to invest in technology and recognized a lot of these processes, there is going to be some efficiencies and that's a tremendous effort on part of our company today is to find out how we can improve compliance and risk efficiencies through automation. Michael Rose - Raymond James : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Grayson, as a follow-up, you have historically talked about having a more balanced loan mix between business and consumer. Can you update us on any sort of thoughts there and what the puts or takes are in getting there over time? Thanks. Grayson Hall : We have been stating that desire strategically for some time that we would love to achieve a greater balance between business and consumer on our balance sheet in terms of loans outstanding. We have made a tremendous number of investments in the consumer lending products to try to accelerate that remixing, if you will, of the balance sheet. As you have seen, we have not been particularly successful at that. There has been more demand on the business loan side of our customer base. And as a consequence, our progress in that regard has been somewhat muted. Long-term, we still have that as a strategic desire on our part to achieve a better mix. That being said, we have to take advantage of what the market offers us in any given economy. And so, still a goal that we are working on but not there yet. Michael Rose - Raymond James : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Good morning. My first question, just on the LCR, David. How much is the securities portfolio going to grow as you march towards compliance in 2015? Or are we really going to see a remix of your balance into HQLA? And I assume that the one to three basis points in terms of forward guidance for the NIM considers that? David Turner : Yes, Erika. It did, in fact, consider that. We see very little change in mix. I was trying to address that earlier in my comments that we have pretty large securities book. We were happy with the rules that came out. And we don't see any problem becoming compliant 2016 without any meaningful changes to our balance sheet mix. So you shouldn't expect any type of significant change or increase in our securities book. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Got it, and just wanted to follow up to Ken's question. Another institution had helped us think about the potential incremental cost of funding your pension next year by giving us some guidance for every 25 basis point in increase in the discount rate that that would turn into an incremental cost of X. Could you similarly help us think about that impact next year? David Turner : We will. I don't have that committed to memory. We do have some sensitivity in our 10-K that would be a little helpful in terms of what the change in the discount rate does. So that would be place that you could go look. But I will have List and Dana follow-up on that. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning, Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. Just David, maybe a question for you. You noted that a 100 basis point increase in the curve would generate about $160 million of incremental NII. If I am reading the 10-Q correctly, that's up from about $111 million three months ago. Could you give us a little more color as to what the components were that drove that increase? David Turner : Matt, I am not sure what you are looking at. You should have actually seen it come down. We had about 6% change in NII as a result of 100 basis parallel shift, which was about $190 million the quarter before, coming down to about $160 million. I think it is with that should -- we will go back and take a look at that. But we essentially took a little bit of our asset sensitivity off with trying to protect ourselves a little bit on the down rate environment. It proved to be the right move given where we are today. But I think that we are still pretty asset sensitive at about 5% of NII. So we took one point off and round numbers from the second to third quarter. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, my apologies. I will follow up with List on that. And then just on fee revenue, a couple of the other banks that have already reported have suggested, even though it's very early days in the fourth quarter, the lower rate environment has actually generated some positive growth in refinancing volume. And I am curious if you can give us some color as to how you are thinking about the mortgage banking fee revenue line heading into the fourth quarter. Grayson Hall : Absolutely, we have been looking at the mortgage rates and the opportunity as the rates have moved to a more favorable position for that business, that the refinance opportunity could accelerate. I would say that we haven't seen that shift yet, but we do anticipate that if the rates continue to stay at this level for over the next few weeks, we will see an increase in refinance. As you may recall, refinance has been a lower percentage of our production than most of our peers. And so it will probably have a more muted impact on us than some of the peers that you are looking at, but we do anticipate an increase in refinance activity. But it is also makes home affordability for the repurchase better as well. So we think it's good for the mortgage business. I will ask David to give any specific comments on it. David Turner : Yes. I think one, we need to let this settle a bit and see whether the mortgage rates actually following and for how long. It takes a while for all that to get into the market. Clearly, if you are resetting 15-year rates in the three range or below and 30-year rates in four range or slightly underneath that, you will see another way to refinance activity. If you look at our supplement, on page nine you will see our refinance activity did pick up a bit in the third quarter. We are up about 7% from where we were in the second quarter. Hard to tell, though, whether that was just really rate driven or just normal activity coming through in the third quarter. So we are looking into that. We will give you better guidance as we see what the impact might be. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets : Good morning. The first question, just circling back to your comments about loan growth. Clearly, on a year-over-year basis, the loan growth has been very muted and it's below the industry loan growth, as evidenced by the H8 data we receive from the Federal Reserve on a weekly basis. Would you say that the slower loan growth is more due to your customers? You indicated some of your customers are still concerned about the operating environment. Or is it more your more conservative underwriting standards that you are using that maybe your competitors are not? Grayson Hall : I think it's really a combination of factors. I think one is that most of the loan growth over the past several quarters has been in the upper end of commercial middle market and into the corporate space, which we were very active there, but candidly the bulk of our businesses has been in the middle market and into the small business owners. We mentioned a moment ago, I think David spoke about it, we have not seen the strength of the small business owner come back yet like we have other parts of the business. So I think one just a mix of our customer base, has caused us to be a little bit more muted or more moderate than some of our competitors. I think also given what this organization has gone through over the past several years, we are just very disciplined, very prudent about credit underwriting at this juncture. And so we would attribute part of our differential between some of the peers to be the credit culture that we have tried to build at this company. And I think the third issue and we alluded to it earlier, there were a number of one-off transactions in the third quarter that we had not anticipated and were not normal part of our portfolio and that was a factor. And I think the last point was that we did just see, and I think many of our competitors acknowledge this as well, as third quarter was more moderate than anticipated. All that being said, again, we are pretty optimistic at this juncture given the way the last month of the quarter performed and the way the early days in the next quarter are starting to perform. So we feel better today about where the economy is headed. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets : Grayson, have you seen any evidence, obviously you guys monitor your customer base very carefully over the years, that you are actually losing customers to competitors because they are being much more aggressive in their underwriting standards? Grayson Hall : No, I would say that we think that our numbers would indicate very clearly, we are still growing our customer base and still deepening the relationships we have with existing customers. We spend an awful lot of time not only analyzing transactions that we win but also transactions we lose. And quite frankly, we aren't winning as many prospect transactions as we would like to. And that's probably true of every competitor we got. We all are wanting to win new customer relationships. It makes sense for the customer. It makes sense for us. I would say that we have seen more non-bank competitors enter into our space, than we have seen before. There is a tremendous amount of liquidity in the marketplace. And so you do see, not only competition from non-banks, but you see the competition from the debt markets. And that being said, we have to complete and we have to adjust and we are doing that. And our loan growth may be more moderate than we had anticipated, but we still have growth and we still anticipate growing our outstandings. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets : And then my other question is on the capital. Obviously your capital ratios are very strong with your Basel III Tier 1 number again over 11%. Do you guys ever see a day when you can give back more of that so that it comes down to a number you are more comfortable with? You look at your return on equity today on a stated book basis and it's under 8%. Your stock obviously trades at a discount to book, suggesting you are not earning your cost of capital. I know on a return on tangible common equity, you are up over 9%. But how do you get rid of all this excess equity? When you look out over the next three years, let's say, because I know CCAR has a lot to do with how much you can give back and you are limited to maybe your earnings in a current year. But what do you guys envision on how to get rid of that excess equity to get that ROE up to a point where your stock and trade above book value? David Turner : Yes. Gerard, this is David. It's a great question, and I will tell you, I would rather have that problem than be on the other side of the fence. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets : I agree. David Turner : Which is where we were at a time. So we do acknowledge that having excess capital is not doing any good and that we need to have an optimal capital stack. That means not only in total, but the components that make up that. And we will adjust that over time in both the components of the capital stack as well as the share number. It's obviously a little more difficult to work, given how we have to approach capital, at least how we perceive we need to approach capital relative to CCAR. But how we manage our capital, that's our call. That's what our Board does. We have a whole process and I do think, over time, you will see those capital numbers rationalize. It will be through a combination of utilizing that capital to grow our business, which is really what we want to do when the opportunity is there. We talked about having acquisitions of product lines like we did our credit card portfolio a few years ago. We looked at using that capital to buy non-banks and looking at bank acquisitions when those opportunities arise and then returning it to the shareholder so that we don't keep piling it up because we realize the return on tangible common over time with the denominator continuing to grow becomes pretty difficult. So we will and do envision the time where we can rationalize. Grayson Hall : But you look at it and I think we are in a transition phase. Our capital planning process has gotten much formal, much more sophisticated and our confidence in that capital planning process is much hard today and it continues to improve. And at the same time, we derisk our loan portfolio tremendously. And so we have more confidence in how our loan portfolio will perform going forward. All of those are things that give us confidence in how best to deploy capital and at what level to deploy. As we get a better economy, it would be our hope that we would have more organic opportunities to deploy that capital, but also think as the economy recovers that we are going to have opportunities, as David said, to acquire and how you define what we acquire will be a mix of opportunities. But I think at the end of the day, if those things don't prove to fruition then we have the opportunity to return that to the shareholder in the form of dividends or buybacks. And I think that we are in a transition that's a little bit uncertain but it gets more certain each and everyday. David Turner : Gerard, I will add one last thing, you mentioned cost of capital. One of our goal clearly is to reduce our cost of capital and that comes with a good sustainable performance, solid performance quarter in and quarter out, such that our cash flows are more predictable and we think we have done that. But the market is saying not quite yet. And we hope over time, the market realizes our sustainability of this cash flow to get our cost to capital down and again optimizing the capital stack would be another way to get that cost to capital down, and we will do that. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets : Guys, thank you very much. Operator : Your question will come from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : My questions have already been answered. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. John Pancari - Evercore: Good morning. Just a quick question on margin. Can you give a little more color on the increase in the interest-bearing deposit costs in the quarter? It looks like a couple of items went up including your CD costs by about four bips or so. So I wanted to get a little bit detail on why we are starting to see a lift in some of these deposit items. David Turner : Yes. There is really no story there. That could just be mix on a given customer. We have run some tests to try and see what might happen if we go a little longer on some CDs in particular to see what the markets acceptability to have some of those. So that could be a piece of it. But there is really not is big story there or a trend that you should expect going forward there. Grayson Hall : But we have runs market test. And obviously one of the risk we have is when rates go up, what sort of pressure does that put on customer deposits and we have run a number of sensitivity tests in some markets to be able to prove our theories and so you will see some of the interest rate numbers, individually, go up a result of some of those. But they are temporary nature and overall our deposit cost continues to remain stable. John Pancari - Evercore: Okay, all right, and then secondly, also on the margin. On the securities yields, I just want to confirm that the bulk of that 11 basis points decline linked quarter, what drove that and how much of that was premium amortization in terms of the bips impact on the yield? And then also curious about your new pricing? Or your pricing on your new auto loan originations or spreads, if you can't give us the upfront yields? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So the securities yields, they are down 11 basis points. Obviously reinvesting in just a lower rate environment but the premium amortization is also about half of that number. We did also shift out of corporate bonds as spreads changed and that we think that that was the right thing to do. You see your corporate bond portfolio will have declined. You asked about audit spreads. There was really no change there. Obviously it's a very competitive environment to be in indirect auto but we had about seven basis points contraction during the quarter, but we still feel good about that overall yield and spread that we have. I think you can just see -- those can change, only dependent on what mix you are putting on the books. But our overall yield on that indirect as you see in our supplement, was $3.39 million versus $3.46 million last quarter. Grayson Hall : Yes. And as that market segments become more competitive, we have adjusted our pricing strategies to ensure that we have got the right mix of tenure and rate and that it's appropriately risk-based priced. And so you will see a little bit of shift in yield as adjust our strategy because we want to make sure that we are staying in the right part of that market. John Pancari - Evercore: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. I know the call is running long. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Dick. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital : Hi, good morning. I am sorry to ask you a question after such a long meeting. But I am looking at these peer-to-peer companies and considering the fact that apparently the GSEs are now going to buy mortgages that have 3% to 5% down payments, and given your large, if you will, customer base in the, we will say the under-banked, I am wondering if a bank can get into the peer-to-peer business, number one and number two, if this reduction in the down payments to nonqualified mortgage levels allows some opportunity there? Grayson Hall : Dick, you are really familiar with the markets we operate in across the Southeast and we think it's a valuable franchise because of those markets. But we obviously operate in some real communities where the opportunities are a little different, maybe than some of our peers see and I do think that there are ample opportunities in our market to be able to bank some customers that typically would not have qualified for mortgages. And we have been we been very methodical about the way we have approached that market and prudent about it. Obviously with the GSE, we are going to change the rules. We are watching that very closely with our peer. We are reading some of the same reports you are. It appears that they are pretty close to agreement on how do that and what the rules are on that. And I think we are very interested, if we can understand the rules and agree what risk we are taking, if we can make the economics work out on it, then we are encouraged. And so I do think you are absolutely correct. It's an opportunity for our franchise. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital : And the company, I was thinking, this lending club is about to go public. And I was looking at the prospectus and they are charging up to 20% rate on people who have FICO scores in the mid-600s and they are not making the loans, they are shifting the loan. They are a facilitator, so other people make these loans and they are taking, in some cases, as much as 6% overrides for finding the loans. And I am just wondering, would a bank ever be allowed to be a facilitator like that where it simply shifts the loans to other buyers and takes a fee for finding the customer, underwriting a loan and sending it along? Grayson Hall : Well, that's a great question and we have every one of these, if you will, technology based lending solutions, whether its peer-to-peer or whether it's just that an origination position. We have taken a hard look at every one of them and I think it's a good question. Quite frankly, we have got a number of competitors, that their rules of engagement are different than ours. And so you know today in our environment some of that type of lending, I just think we have to stay away from. But that being said, there are still a lot of opportunities in that space and we have got a team of really talented people that continue to look at it. We think innovation is a big part of how we bank the consumer going forward on both the deposit and the lending side. And some of these solutions that you are seeing are going to play out and some of them are. And it's our challenge trying to figure out who winners and losers are in that space. David Turner : Dick, this is David. You had mentioned really banking kind of funding somebody else. What we would like to and are looking at is how those parties actually bring the customer to the table so that those are our customers where we can have a deeper relationship than whatever that one-off loan is. And so that really seems to be the better alternative versus being a funding agent, if you will, for somebody else's customers. But as Grayson mentioned, things are changing pretty rapidly and we have to be able to adapt and deal with this on a prudent basis and obviously within the confines of our regulatory regime that we have. Grayson Hall : But a lot of financial products are moving out of the traditional banking space and we have got to learn to compete with them but compete under the rules that we operate under. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital : Okay. Thank you very much. Grayson Hall : Thank you. That's our last question. And we appreciate everyone's participation, everyone's interest we will stand adjourned. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paula, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. List Underwood : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Our presenters today are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of our Executive Management Team are present and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the Appendix section of the presentation. Grayson? Grayson Hall : Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us for this morning as we review our fourth quarter and our full year 2014 results. This quarter we reported $195 million of net income available to common shareholders, bringing our full year results to $1.1 billion of net income available to common shareholders and earnings per diluted share of $0.80, an increase of 4% over 2013. Included in the earnings were some unusual items which David will address in his remarks. Overall these results reflects steady progress in 2014 as we continue to focus on the fundamentals of banking and meeting customer needs through service and innovation, while maintaining a prudent and disciplined risk culture. In 2014, we grew loans and deposits. We expanded our customer base. We prudently managed expenses. We improved asset quality and improved our capital ratios. Loans increased to a total of $3 billion or 4% during 2014. Importantly, this growth was broad based with both the business and consumer loan portfolios increasing. In 2014, deposits increased $2 billion or 2%, while deposit cost reached historic lows. Through the successful execution of Regions360, which is our prescriptive approach to relationship banking, the number of quality households increased and we grew the number of checking, savings, credit card and wealth management accounts. We believe this growth positions us well as we head into 2015. We remain focused on achieving operational efficiencies and reduced full year expenses on an adjusted basis by 2% from the previous year. An example of our efforts during the fourth quarter, we made a decision to consolidate 50 branch offices or approximately 3% of our network in locations across our markets. Over time, we expect to add branches in higher opportunity markets such as St Louis, Atlanta, Houston and New Orleans. Through improved technology, these smaller branches will employ different staffing models and will be far more efficient. In 2014, our asset quality continued to improve, reflecting our continued, prudent risk discipline practices. In fact, all our credit metrics experienced improvement in 2014. As a result of this progress and citing improvement in our overall risk profile, we received positive rating actions from four major credit rating agencies this past year. Also during 2014, our capital returned to shareholders totaled approximately $500 million. This included and increased our quarterly dividend as well as share repurchases. With respect to future capital deployment, as you are aware, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month and expect to receive the result sometime in March. Clearly we believe that our capital position is sufficient to support both the return of capital and strong organic growth. With that said returning capital to shareholders is a top priority and given the strength of our current capital levels we believe is appropriate to increase our total payout ratio. In 2015, in addition to effectively deploying capital, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage and keenly focused on revenue diversification. Shifting to the economic environment, I want to talk briefly about the recent declines in oil prices and its impact on our energy lending portfolio. We're closely monitoring the price declines for direct and indirect impacts to our overall loan portfolio quality. Our bank has extensive energy lending expertise dating back multiple decades and through numerous energy cycles. Our core exploration and production loans at present are well secured and provide a collateral cushion to withstand price declines. In terms of broader impact, we have been monitoring markets such as Texas and the Gulf Coast for signs of weakness in employment and housing. However, we're not seeing any material weakness past this point in time. We have provided additional detail regarding our energy portfolio in the appendix of the earnings presentation. As we look ahead, we expect improved growth in the U.S. economy in 2015. Low energy prices should provide a tailwind to consumer spending and the manufacturing sector. However, an uncertain global growth environment does pose some risk. As a result, we continue to expect an increase in short-term rates in the latter part of 2015.  With that, I'll turn it over to David, who will cover the details of the fourth quarter. David? David Turner : Thank you. And good morning, everyone. I'll first take you through the fourth quarter details and then wrap up with expectations for 2015. Loan balances totaled $77 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up $700 million or 1% from the end of the previous quarter. Business lending finished the year strong, totaling $48 billion at the end of the quarter. This was an increase of $524 million or 1% from the third quarter as production increased 18%. Commercial and industrial loans grew $875 million or 3% from the prior quarter. This growth was driven by our specialized industries group, as well as Regions' business capital. Importantly, line utilization increased 40 basis points. Commitments for new loans increased 3% and our pipelines remain strong. Regarding investor real estate, ending balances were relatively steady from the previous quarter at approximately $7 billion. As we have previously stated, investor real estate remains an important part of our corporate bank strategy, given our market presence in the South East. Moving to consumer lending, loans in this portfolio increased 1% linked quarter. Growth in the consumer portfolio was led by indirect auto lending as balances increased 3% from the prior quarter. While we benefitted from the robust market for auto sales, process improvements instituted earlier in the year also contributed to the growth. Credit card balance has increased $45 million or 5% from the previous quarter. This improvement was driven by a 6% increase in spending as well as a 3% increase in active card holders. Mortgage balances were up modestly. Meanwhile total home equity balances were down slightly as the pace of loan payoffs was slightly higher than new production. Total home equity production increased 10% from the previous quarter as customers continued to take advantage of lower rates on variable home equity lines of credit. This quarter other consumer loans were up just over 1% as a result of the introduction of several new products and improved customer delivery. Let\u2019s take a look at deposit. Supported by our multichannel platform, total deposits continued to grow increasing $70 million during the fourth quarter. Of note, low-cost deposits grew by $242 million and continued to account for 91% of total deposits. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels and totalled 11 basis points, while total funding costs declined to 29 basis points in the quarter. Let's take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $87 million. Net interest margin was 3.17%, a decline of one basis point from the third quarter. Despite a continuation of low rate environment which exerted pressure on asset yields, both net interest income and net interest margin remained relatively stable with the previous quarter. Stability in both measures was largely attributable to higher average loan balances and lower cash balances. Total non-interest income declined $30 million or 6% in the fourth quarter. Services charges declined $40 million from the previous quarter and this was primarily due to a $4 million decline in fees resulting from a product discontinuation in the fourth quarter. Additionally there was an $8 million reduction in revenue related to customer reimbursements. Mortgage income was down $12 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to lower gains from loan sales and a decline in the market valuation of the mortgage servicing portfolio, net of hedging activity. In the fourth quarter we purchased servicing rights on $833 million of loans, bringing our total servicing portfolio to $40 billion. We have the operational capacity to take on additional servicing volume and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to add volume to our servicing portfolio. While mortgage production declined in 2014, the pace of our decline was less than the industry. Originations continue to be driven by new home purchases and represented on average 70% of total originations in the fourth quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect mortgage production in 2015 to exceed that of 2014. Capital markets income decreased $4 million quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by credit valuation adjustments on interest rate swaps. Absent these adjustments, capital markets income increased slightly from the prior quarter. As we continue to build out our capital markets capabilities, we believe that\u2019s it indications in real estate capital markets represent opportunities for us. Card and ATM fees increased as a result of higher spending and transaction volumes. And wealth management income also increased and as a company continues to expand and deepen relationship with new and existing customers. While we had experienced headwinds as it relates to non interest income growth, we have several initiatives currently underway to offset these pressures. As Grayson mentioned throughout 2015 we will focus on diversifying our revenue. Let's move on to expenses. Total expenses in the fourth quarter were $969 million, an increase of $143 million which included some unusual items. As a reminder, there in the third quarter we benefited from the recovery of expenses related to unfunded commitments of $24 million. This was partially offset by expenses related to Visa Class B shares sold in prior years which resulted in $7 million of additional expense in the third quarter. As Grayson mentioned, we intend to consolidate 50 branches in 2015 and incur related expense of $10 million during the fourth quarter. We expect to incur additional related expenses of approximately $15 million in the first quarter of 2015 related to this consolidation. Also at the end of the quarter, we recorded an accrual of $100 million for contingent, legal and regulatory items related to previously disclosed matters. And although you may have additional questions, please recognize that we cannot comment beyond this disclosure at this time. Salaries and benefits remain flat from the previous quarter, although headcount increased 124 positions. Importantly, the majority of these positions are revenue generating or revenue support roles and drive future growth in revenue. Additionally, we had incremental hires and capital planning and risk management this quarter. However, at this juncture we believe that, hires of this nature are substantially complete. Total credit expenses remained low. However, fourth quarter expenses increased slightly as a benefit related to gains from our held for sale portfolio diminished as balances declined along with the seasonal uptick in OREO property tax expense. Outside services increased due to third party engagements to support risk management and capital planning functions. However, these third party expenses should begin to subside and I\u2019ll talk about that in just a minute. We remain diligent with respect to expense control but we have opportunistically invested in talent and technology to further accelerate our momentum to grow revenue. Let's move on to asset quality. Our overall asset quality remained solid as most credit metrics improved in the quarter. Our nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined 1% linked quarter. In addition, at quarter end, our loan-loss allowance to nonperforming loans or coverage ratio was 133%. Compared to the third quarter, total delinquencies declined 11% and troubled debt restructuring or TDRs declined 6%. In addition, both criticized and classified loans declined from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs totalled $83 million representing 42 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $8 million or $75 million less than that charge-offs. And based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However at this point of cycle, volatility and certain metrics can be expected. Let's move on to capital liquidity. We continue to maintain industry leading capital levels. At the end of the quarter, our estimated Tier 1 ratio stood at 12.5% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.6%. Further, we estimate our fully phased in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio to be 11.1%. During the quarter, we repurchased $248 million of stock as far as the Board approved program that totalled $350 million dollars. We expect to complete this program during the first quarter of 2015. The liquidity at the bank and the holding company remains solid with a low loan deposit ratio of 82%. In regarding the liquidity coverage ratio, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation. Now, throughout 2015 we will update customer agreements to include LCR friendly language, to modify existing deposit products and we also plan to create new products and services to compliment our strong position of high quality liquid assets and it's important to note, that no major balance sheet initiatives are necessary in a order for us to be compliant. And now I want to take a few minutes and touch on our expectations for 2015. We expect total loan growth in the 4% to 6% range. Commercial investor loans are expected to drive the loan growth with the business lending portfolio - within the business lending portfolio. Also we believe that investor real estate portfolio has reached a point of stabilization. However, growth will be limited as we remain committed to our risk tolerance levels, as it relates to this portfolio. Looking at the consumer lending book, we expect continued growth from indirect auto lending. We plan to continue to focus on driving better pull through rates, increasing margins and improving overall credit profiles. Additionally we are focused on expanding lending through online and point of sale financing alternatives directly and through partnership with third parties. As a result, we expect to pace our growth in the other consumer category to accelerate in 2015. And moving onto credit card, today our marketing efforts have primarily targeted our existing customer base. As a result, our penetration rate is up 190 basis points over the last year. This increase coupled with an increase in sales of new cards, should drive balanced growth in the near term. We expect incremental growth and mortgage balances during 2015 as the pace of production should more than outpace refinancing activity. From a production perspective, consumer lending closed the year on a strong note. In fact, December was a strongest single production month of the year. With respect to deposits, balances should grow at similar rates as 2014. As a reminder, a significant portion of our deposits were made up of individual deposits, which turn to be more granular, smaller in size which based on our research should be more stable and less rate sensitive in a rising rate environment. With deposit cost, deposit and funding costs expected to remain stable at historically low levels, there is limited ability to offset the continued effect of the low rate environment on margin. That being said, the net interest market would be expected to remain stable to trending higher in a moderately rising rate environment in 2015. And if current market conditions prevail, then net interest margin is expected to relatively stable next quarter. However, with rates at current levels, the net interest margin would experience gradual pressure over the year. For example, if the ten year treasury yield would remain in the 175% to 2% range throughout 2015, we would expect 10 to 12 basis points of margin pressure. From an NIR standpoint, we expect this line item to grow in 2015 resulting from our investments that we have made in wealth management and in our corporate bank. Specifically, we made investment in insurance, investment services, institutional services and private wealth management. Additionally, our investments in capital markets, Fannie Mae just is an example. And new hires related to our power and utilities in financial services team and treasury management corporate banks are expected to pay off in 2015. And finally, mortgage should have a stronger 2015 than 2014. From an expense standpoint, we will continue to focus on our cost. Our largest categories, salaries and benefits, occupancy, and furniture and fixtures will be areas of focus in 2015. In addition, third party consulting cost is another area where we have opportunity to reduce those expenditures. All-in-all, we expect to generate positive operating leverage for 2015. Now let me close by saying that 2014 was the year of solid progress and we are diligently focused on executing our strategies as we head into 2015. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and now I'll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. List Underwood : Thanks David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would please ask each caller to limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now let's open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Just I heard you loud and clear in terms of your NIR guidance for the year. But I was wondering if we could get a little bit of clarity on the starting point. This is the first question. Is the $4 million decline in fees resulting from product discontinuation the final impact from that discontinuation? And is it fair for us to add back the customer reimbursements of $4 million and the CVA adjustment - the customer reimbursement of $8 million and the CVA adjustment of $4 million, back to the 448. Grayson Hall : Erika, the discontinuation $4 million just about $3.5 million left there and that will be done. And yes, the $8 million should be non-recurring, so that is - your conclusion is appropriate there. Erika Najarian : In terms of your guidance of positive operating leverage, if the ten-year does stay between 1.75% to 2% range, and the Fed doesn\u2019t move, can you continue to chop away at the efficiency ratio, I think on a core basis I calculated 66.8% this quarter. Grayson Hall : Erika, I think that if rates were to stay where they\u2019re at, and that the Fed does not raise rates this year, obviously we\u2019ve got to manage through that possibility and as David said earlier, we\u2019re focused on remaining very disciplined and very keenly focused on opportunities to continue to rationalize our expenses across the company. We\u2019ll have to continue to do that and we think we\u2019ve proven that if you look backwards in terms of how we\u2019ve managed expenses. Moving forward, obviously in this rate environment it means that we\u2019ve really got to raise the bar if you will on that activity and I think you should continue to see us look at ways to rationalize expenses across the franchise as we had mentioned we had announced the closure and consolidation of 50 offices, I think since - if you look back over the past few years, we\u2019ve reduced our physical footprints some 20%, as well as attacked expenses across the franchise and across channels. David, anything to add? David Turner : I think we have to continue to look at our total business in terms of expense management under any scenario, any rate environment. We do believe that there is a tendency to have short term rates go up towards the back end of the year still, we believe that's what the Fed wants to do. We have to be prepared in case that's not the case, and so we\u2019re committed to seeking positive operating leverage in any scenario. It gets harder if rates stay lower. Erika Najarian : Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Wonder if you can give us a little more color on the 2015, margin outlook. Is that expectation for 10 to 12 basis points of compression, is that incremental off of the fourth quarter margin number? In other words, from this fourth quarter till the fourth quarter of 2015, or is that full year 2015 margin on an average basis versus the full year 2014 margin? David Turner : That\u2019s really leveraging, John, of the fourth quarter where we are right now, and that would be - the impact of that really would be felt later in the year versus the earlier in the year. Again, to the extent that that\u2019s a sustainable 1.75% to 2%, throughout 2015. John Pancari : And you just alluded to what my follow was going to be on the margin, so therefore, if that's the case, the Fed does nothing, next quarter you\u2019ve got a flattish margin, however from the second, third, and fourth quarter, for 2015, you expect 10 to 12 bps of compression during that period, so what is implying that drop-off? Because that does imply pretty good down tick from here. David Turner : Well, I think we\u2019d continue to see the negative impacts of lower rates on reinvestment yields in particular where we\u2019re having to put to work $300 million, $400 million of cash every month. And you continue to see the rollover effect of lower rates in the loan book as well. So, we think that if you look at where we think the Fed's going to be towards the middle of the year, we think you\u2019ll start seeing some pressure to increase short term rates, and so we haven\u2019t abandoned that, what we wanted to try to do is put some sensitivities and some extent that that does not happen. And at the \u2013 ten-year [Inaudible] rates also stay lower. So, we\u2019re not saying that\u2019s what will happen or that we expect that to happen, we were just trying to give you a little bit sensitivity of possibly what could happen. John Pancari : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Good morning. David, just to follow up on the expense side, understanding the clear focus on operating leverage. Last year you were able to also help us understand the directional dollars on the expense side - and you did a really good job of getting it down two and change percent. So with all these pushes and pulls and wanting to leave the door open on investments, so can you help us frame an understanding of where you think expense dollars can go given that premise of uncertainty on the revenue side? David Turner : We think, Ken, we\u2019ve made investments in a number of areas this year because we believe growing revenue is important for our franchise, we\u2019ve hired people to do that. We\u2019ve hired some late in the year that will have full run rate going forward. We have the negative impact of tension that will hit us for 2015, that\u2019s about $25 million in total for the year. So, call it $6 million per quarter. So with that and the investments we\u2019ve made - we\u2019re talking about expense management and revenue together in terms of positive operating leverage versus a commitment on just expense levels because we\u2019ve needed to make these investments to grow revenue. We think they\u2019ll pay off and so I guess the best I can do to describe where you want to go is that positive operating leverage is something that we should be able to achieve in 2015. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then, on the C side, just coming back to - also expecting growth there, I am assuming that\u2019s off of your adjusted 17.84 base. But what I wanted to dig down into is that, I am assuming that's inclusive of the $3.5 million of that lingering deposit advance run off. And then also, can you just remind us, is it also inclusive of the expected overdraft charge changes as well? David Turner : It does include both of those. Ken Usdin : And then my last one just on that last point is, any update or changes with regards to the numbers you\u2019ve tried to put around your \u2013 that potential delta on deposit - on overdrafts? Thanks. David Turner : No. We're doing some pilots right now on that posting order, and nothing's come to our attention that calls us to want to change that guidance we gave you 10 to 15 per quarter, when implemented. Ken Usdin : Thanks David. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, one clarification question just on NIM outlook, I just want to make sure - in your second bullet point where you say, if the ten year yield were 1.75% to 2%, that would drive 10 to 12 basis points of NIM pressure throughout 2015. Does that scenario also include your base case scenario for the front end moving up in the middle of the year? Grayson Hall : We have incorporated - we have our base case in terms of the front end moving up, and what we\u2019re trying to say is that we have - this risk would be on top of what we already project for that, so you could take our base case and then take 10 to 12 basis points on top of that. But that really is - the 10 to 12 - we think we\u2019ll have relatively stable margin like I said in the first quarter even in low persistent rate environment. The impact starts - it could be felt later in the year. Really in the third and fourth quarter it\u2019s more pervasive. Betsy Graseck : Right, so then if there\u2019s no rate hike at the front end of the curve, does that - how does that impact your outlook, would that be incremental negative or not material? Grayson Hall : It would be, but that impact would be felt later in the year as well. We didn\u2019t really have a full effect until the end of the year anyway. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, and then just on the branch consolidation, the 50 branches in 2015, could you give us some color as to have extensive the review was of the branch network, and is this a beginning of consolidation or does this get you largely through what you intend to do on the network? Grayson Hall : Thus we've been -- we've been very disciplined about doing an annual review of our multi-channel delivery system, branches being part of that. When we look at investments that we're making in branches, our ATMs, mobile homeland contact center, we look at across the channels, we may convert irrational decision on what we're investing in there. If you look at what we've done on physical branch presence, as I mentioned over the past, five, seven years we've probably consolidated over 20% of our franchise. From a branch account standpoint, we're around 1,666 offices today. We continue -- we will continue to look at that on an annual basis. It's an ongoing process for us. It's not a one-time and done, but it's rather part of how we think about our customer deliver points and so you should anticipate we will continue to do this each and every year. Betsy Graseck : All right. And the cost of closing the branches is in line with what you've done previously. I am just wondering if\u2026 Grayson Hall : Yes, we've got pretty good experience based on this and not only from a estimating the cost -- the cost reductions that come out of those branches, but just as importantly is retention of customer relationships as we close with branches and so we think we -- from an modeling standpoint, we think we've got pretty good model and we understand how to execute on branch consolidations and closures. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then I guess just a last follow-up here is on the online product that you indicated in the prepared remarks that in the other consumer category should expect to accelerate in part from the online lending focus. Could you give us some color on what you mean by that, what you're investing in and how any pilots are going? Grayson Hall : The conclusion -- we continue to look at both online and mobile, both of those channels have very strong growth rates year-over-year and most of those, most of that activity as you are well aware is around fairly routine bank transactions, balance inquiry, funds transfer, bill payment. But all the things we've discovered through some of the product innovation we've had over the two last two or three years is that the desire for customers to also have the ability to borrow money online and also borrow money at point of sale and so we are introducing a number of new online capabilities as well as some partnership capabilities we have on a sale. That's an activity that we'll be making announcements on as the year progresses and it's just a way to extend our brand further into market places that we are as dominant today. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks for the color there. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Bill. Bill Carcache : Good morning. Thank you. I had a question on asset quality remained strong, but I am trying to get a sense for how we should think about the trajectory of your net charge-off rate. It looks like it troughed at 35 basis points in the second quarter and it's been rising three to four basis points since per quarter. And I guess as we look ahead, should we continue to expect that kind of similar level of quarterly increase over the next few quarters as credit normalizes? I guess at what point does it level out assuming credit conditions remain favorable? Any color around that would be helpful. David Turner : One of the things we're going to leave in our prepared comments is when you get this down to this level of charge-offs in particular, you can see volatility in any given quarter. We're trying to leave you with you the conclusion that in particular if you look at criticizing Class 5 loans, that's one of the earliest indicators of where your credit quality is going. That would imply that over time, we see the charge-off rate continuing to come down. Where it settles out we'll have to see, but we don't believe that the level it's at now is fixed. We believe that does come down. Assuming that condition, economic conditions continue to perform where they are now. So you have to make your own assessment as to where that might -- that terminal value would be, but it should -- it should be lower than what it is over time. Bill Carcache : Okay. I think -- separate question on auto, can you talk about the nature of your relationship with your dealer partners in the indirect auto lending side of your business and address specifically how dealer participation works. In particular I wondering how much freedom your dealer partners have to charge auto loan customers rates that are above and beyond the rate at which you're willing to underwrite a loan? David Turner : So we have almost 1,700 dealers today. We have -- I didn't see the -- to work with large dealer groups where understanding the dynamics and the changes that are going on in the industry are in terms of pricing and trying to be fair to customers and transparent to customers. We like virtually everybody in the industry do give opportunities for dealers to mark-up the rate. Today it's up to 200 basis points. We know that that's being evaluated by regulatory supervisors in the industry and we're going to stay connected to what that looks like. We think there is a chance the whole industry might move in a given direction, but we think we're spot on with what others are doing in the industry. Grayson Hall : But Bill we have a -- we have very rigorous monitoring program of our dealerships and to monitor their activities and to make sure that we're confident in their capabilities for underwriting and pricing. We also have a single price grid, franchise-wide, and are very, very disciplined about maintaining that pricing grid in exactly where our approval rates are if what FICO scores they were delivering on a monthly basis. Now we continue to tighten up the rigor around our credit practices in that segment making improvements literally on a continuous basis. Bill Carcache : Okay. Can you say finally on that point whether any of the changes to the practices that you've made have been prompted by your discussions with regulators or have kind of regulators been more kind of on a fact finding -- fact gathering kind of mode and haven\u2019t necessarily been asking for any changes to be made, just that\u2026 Grayson Hall : Bill really only I can say is we continue to have very detailed and productive conversations with our regulatory supervisors. We have decisions where changes where we believe they're necessary in order for the business to perform better and it's a longstanding relationship and so we feel we'll account for where we're at today. As David said earlier, there are tremendous debates in the industry about how these products are delivered. As those rules changes occur, we will adjust to that. Bill Carcache : Understood. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. On expenses, David any ballpark numbers for what kind of savings you could get from the new branch rationalizations that you took the charge for this quarter and next quarter? David Turner : Well I'll tell you that generally speaking when we take charges, we like to target the payback period to be somewhere in the three to five year range. This is on the lower end of that and we continue to evaluate our whole footprint and to the extent that we can consolidate -- every time we consolidate braches, we lose revenue. The idea though is to be able to adjust expenses -- run rate expenses faster than the revenue that we're losing. And so as we look at these last 50, we're closer to that three-year payback range and as Grayson mentioned earlier, we will continue to evaluate all of our branches and rationalize those and make investments in others. John McDonald : Okay. And just take you to that item on the operating leverage goal for positive operating leverage, I assume that's on an adjusted basis year-over-year, that you should infer wouldn't include like the legal charge this quarter? David Turner : That's correct. John McDonald : Okay. And is there any efficiency goal aside to that just to issue? David Turner : We've talked about our efficiency ratio over long term to be in that 55% to 59% range. We need a rate increase for that to happen. While we wait, believe we can drift down into the lower 60s of efficiency ratio. 2015 we're targeting to be better than we are in 2014 and all that's on an adjusted basis. John McDonald : Okay. And then just for a follow-up on a payout, how you're thinking about what's the right kind of payout ratio for regions? You've got a lot of capital. Given how much this year's buyback was backend loaded on a quarterly basis, you're now actually returning on a high percentage of your earnings this quarter and hopefully next. I guess just kind of as you went through CCAR, how did you approach thinking about where the payout ratio should go broadly over the next year or two? David Turner : Yes so as a result of us being in the middle of a regulatory submission, we need to be careful exactly with what we're saying, although the answer and sometime in March we will let you know. But the way we thought about capital was first off we wanted to get our dividend closer to where peers and market expectations were. We clearly wanted to use our capital to grow our business. Organically we think that's important. When you look at our capital ratios that we have, we have more common equity Tier 1 than most of our peers and we believe we needed to be a little more forward leaning in terms of putting that capital to work. So you should expect that ratio to be higher. We don't necessarily target a total payout ratio per se. We look at optimizing, excuse me optimizing our capital stack in terms of what's in the capital stack and the sheer dollar amount to become as efficient as we can be and we realize we had more capital our Tier 1 common or common equity Tier 1 on Basel III in most. That's why we think we can do the things we need to do to get the dividend up, to get the investments made to grow our business and serve our customers and return appropriate amount to our shareholders and that's what we did. John McDonald : And I guess one of the concerns some shareholders have is that you're aligned to a bank acquisition that's dilutive and you don't have a currency to your stock right now in terms of a multiple to do a bank deal. And I guess could you just give us your thoughts about being disciplined on that in terms of using capital given where you trade today and your appetite to do a bank deal or opposed to doing some kind of cash deal to increase your fee income and how you're thinking along those lines? David Turner : So you pointed out rightly. We also look at our currency. We think strategically about acquisitions, but I think you bring up a great point in terms of where we are from a currency standpoint. We do have a capital that we can put to work in terms of the organic growth and returns to shareholders and use that excess capital on appropriate acquisition whether it be a bank or non-bank where you're using cash as a currency versus your stock. And so that's a little more available to us today given our capital position, but we're well aware of expectations on dilution and being able to payback that dilution in a reasonable period of time and we're not in the mode of doing an acquisition just to do an acquisition. We will be very thoughtful and we need to get our currency up and we will do that by executing our business plan and executing our strategy first and foremost and there will be plenty of time for acquisitions after we get that dealt with. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller : Yes. Thank you very much. On the $10 million of increased expenses that you said really it's I guess for outside consultants and I guess it's really -- it's some of the regulations for Dodd-Frank, CCAR what not. Is that a one-time charge or should we model that going forward into the models? David Turner : Are you speaking of the $10 million for the branch consolidations or\u2026 Paul Miller : Maybe I am misreading, but I thought there was a $10 million of increased consultants. David Turner : Its $5 million Paul. If you look at outside services, it went up about $5 million. Paul Miller : I am sorry. David Turner : That was related to third party consultants and our capital planning process and certain risk management initiatives. Those are areas reasonably we point that out, those are areas where -- that we have a chance to cut those back and become more efficient on, but that is unrelated to the branch $10 million charge that we took. Paul Miller : Okay. So that's an area that you think you can get down over time, but we should be modeling that in for the short term? David Turner : Well we think we can get that down and third parties are one of the easiest -- third party expenditures are one of the easier ones to deal with because you don't have to sign a contract. So we should -- we expect and you should expect over time that we work on third party cost and get those down to -- at level that is appropriate for our institution. Paul Miller : And then you might not have these numbers. You don't -- you usually can have somebody give me a call back, but what exactly -- I couldn\u2019t really calculate, what is your capitalized cost of servicing because you did take it right down to the MSR, but what did you take it down to on a capitalized cost of servicing number? David Turner : I don't have that. We'll get -- Paul, we'll get that -- get back\u2026 Paul Miller : If you can give me a call back that would be great. Hey guys, thank you very much. David Turner : Thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of topics that have been addressed, but as I think about everything that you've said about your net interest margin and assuming that the forward curve is still correct in terms of implied midyear hike and given your fairly robust loan growth guidance, how should I think about sort of the geography of net interest income dollars over the next few quarters here? David Turner : Well Eric to the extent that we can give a rising rate, what we will say is that we can have modest improvement to our overall net interest income and resulting NIM if that occurs. We do believe we will have an increase in the shorter rates. We don't believe it will start through mid year. So we expect that to be an opportunities for us in terms of revenue growth if the loan growth will pan out like we've talked about and if the rate environment works like we've talked about, we think that's an area where we can grow revenue. We've had a pretty resilient margin relative to our peers and so we're looking forward to that. We will try and give you the -- if that doesn\u2019t happen, here is what the risk is relative to that expectation and that's what the 10 to 12 basis point is all about. Eric Wasserstrom : All right and in that scenario, does your loan growth result in flat net interest income dollars or is there some downward risk in the lack of -- in the 175 to 200 basis point tenure scenario? David Turner : Well if you're adding interest earning assets, we should be able to grow with that incrementally our NII. The issue is that at what margin will that ultimately result in. So you could have a growing NII and a decline in the resulting margin that's been at where you put assets on the books. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. And just to follow-up on asset quality for a moment, how should we think about your reserve adequacy at this stage given that the reserve releases have moved, not necessarily entirely with the direction of net charge-offs on a sort of quarter-over-quarter basis. David Turner : Yes, so the question is really where we think overall allowance levels would trend? We have a pretty sophisticated allowance methodology. We're getting the question where do you think that will ultimately be? As charge-offs continue to come down, as criticized and classified levels come down, as non-performers come down, then you have a tendency to expect and lower allowance to loan ratio. I can't tell you where that terminal value is. I think what's going on the books today is some of the most pristine, incredibly we've had in a long time and I think that each quarter as charge-offs come down, we do believe we have some leverage in our allowance, which helps us keep the provision down lower for a longer period of time, but at some point, that runs out and you have to start providing for whatever your charge-offs are. So the question that was asked earlier in terms of where that charge-off maybe is something we needed to look at and think through, but the allowance is going to be what it's going to be and I think there is an ability for that to come down to some degree. Grayson Hall : But Eric, when you look at the net charge-offs, you just have to keep reminding yourself, there is some residual effect of credits that we've had on our books for a long time that are getting resolved. In addition, the granularity of our loan portfolio does require some level of volatility from quarter to quarter on charge-offs, but when you look at the charge-off in relationship to the provision, the provision really is driving our allowance as a reflection of the overall quality of the portfolio. And as you see from the numbers, the overall quality of our loan portfolio continues to improve. We've got modest loan growth build in through our projections, but a lot of where that provision and resulting allowance winds us trending in large parts tend to pin down loan growth and in what segments that loan growth occurs. Eric Wasserstrom : Great and then just last one for me, your go-forward tax rate, what you're expecting there? David Turner : If you right-size for the impact of the legal and regulatory charge, you saw us in that roughly 29% range and you would expect that fairly similar to 2015. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi guys. Just a follow-up on the energy theme, I guess first in terms of your exposure that you laid out on Page 12, which is very helpful, how do you think about how long oil prices need to stay where they are before we see some cracks just kind of generally speaking in your portfolio? Grayson Hall : Matt, let me if you would, we've prepared that in the appendix to give you a little more data analytically on sort of our exposure in the -- I've got John Turner in the room with me today who manages our energy segment. So John, if you would speak to this for a second. John Turner : Happy to, in terms of how long the prices can stay down, I would say, if you look at the material we've provided, the majority of our exposure is centered either in our exploration production or our oil field services portfolios and if we have a concentration in oil field services that's in marine transportation companies that are serving the deep water, we think that those companies are operating in an environment that has a much longer to play out. Our portfolio is comprised of relatively small number of companies that are located in Louisiana and Texas. They're led by seasoned management teams, have really good liquidity both in the form of cash and credit available to them. They've operated through volatile cycles before. Have good access to capital and so we feel good about our portfolio. We've got a seasoned team of bankers and risk managers. In terms of how long the price can stay down, I don't think we have a sophisticated approach to data to know how long that is because we don't know where the price will end up. A lot of it has to do with where the price ultimately bottoms out and then the length of time that it will stay there, but based upon again good liquidity, good experience amongst our management teams, access to different forms of capital and just the credit profile and small number of customers that we have, we say, we feel pretty good about our exposure today. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful and then just on the flip side as I think about your consumer, from a geographic point of view, you operate in some lower income areas and I would think some of those customers are going to benefit much more from lower gas prices, potentially lower home energy cost. So just talk about some of the dynamics on the consumer side both in terms of maybe some relief on the credit and whether there might be some boost on the lending and spending volumes as well. Grayson Hall : Yes, I think it's a little early to call, but clearly the reduction in price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump has had a material impact on disposable income of a number of our customers and we do operate a number of -- in a number of markets that, that will really play to as an advantage. We continue to see from a consumer lending standpoint, consumer's credit metrics continue to improve and we would anticipate that if oil prices and conversely prices at pump stayed as low for an extended period of time, it will see a strengthening not only in the credit, the credit of those consumers, but also the spending behaviors of those consumers. And we -- you see a number of different scenarios about a penny drop at the pump and how many dollars that actually puts back into the consumer's pocket and those numbers are just startling in size, but I would say that you it's early to see the results of that, but clearly it's occurring and clearly we will see strengthening. I would say that in the fourth quarter we did see really strong results in the activity of both debit and credit card transactions, both in a number of transactions and in the dollar value of those transactions. And as you saw a modest increase in outstanding balances in the credit card portfolio. So maybe those are early signs, but I do think it's still all early for us to decide what the marked improvement will be. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : Hey thanks for taking the questions. One is to ask you David a little bit about the prepayment speeds, if you had any impact in the security yields this quarter may be from the premium bonds being written down a little bit more? And then also you did have a big impact on the write down in the mortgage servicing rights. Does that encompass a big pick up in prepayments already? So just wanted to see the two impacts in those areas of prepayment speed. David Turner : Yes, I think Marty, I think there is really unrelated at this point. We did see a very small amount of pick up in pre amortization. It was about $2 million impact to this negatively in the quarter. So I think our total premium amortization was $42 million up from $40 million in the quarter before. Mortgage was just a little different. Obviously we had a lot of volatility in rates and we obviously have hedges on the hedge as much as the change in fair value as we can. We're a little less effective in those hedges and that was part of the decline in the MSR and then total mortgage we had just lower deliveries into the secondary market that we believe real more of a timing issue for us. So we think those were a little more anomalies that occurred in the fourth quarter than we should hopefully see going forward? Marty Mosby : And would it be fair to reflect that if you look at the amortization, it didn't really accelerate any other future prepayments it may happen, yet if you look at the bag on the servicing rights, maybe you have accelerated some of the impact there? David Turner : Yes, I think so and also we need to look at what's happening right now with rates -- mortgage rates continuing to come down. We could see -- we could see an opportunity for refinance activity helping our mortgage business, but also that negatively impacts us on the mortgage services rights. So we have a little bit of a built in economic hedge to some degree there. We need to still see how that plays out over the course of the year. Marty Mosby : And just lastly, when you talked about the modest rise in interest rate, holding margins flat to pushing it up, you would still expect if you had a short term rise in interest rates, does that eventually kind of pull through positively on your net interest margin. So I just want to make sure of when a structural change that was somewhat pulling that benefit down a little bit. David Turner : No, we continue to be asset sensitive along the curve and short-term rates, medium term, long-term, all those benefit us. I think our last disclosure on F100 was about $160 million, $170 million, which is almost split a third, a third, a third in that scenario. So we benefit from that increase at any level. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt Burnell : Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a couple of very quick follow-ups, it sounds from your answers to Matt's -- Matt O'Connor's prior questions that you have not really incorporated much in the way of increased provisions against the oil exposure that you have or the energy exposure you have in the fourth quarter provision. Is that a reasonable assumption? Grayson Hall : When you look at our fourth quarter provision, we're not saying any adverse impacts yet in that part of the portfolio that would be included in the quantitative part of our allowance methodologies. In the qualitative part, obviously any market uncertainties in oil and gas being one of those, is included in that quantitative analysis and there would be some consideration given to the fact that oil prices have dropped, but an explicit special reserve we did not do that. We let our methodologies process the way they are built to be modeled and we believe we have taken the right stance on that. Matt Burnell : And just following up on that exposure, have you said publicly what the losses have been back in other periods of declining oil prices or perhaps what the non-performing asset levels rose to just to get a sense of sort of what the potential risk might be? Grayson Hall : We have not, but Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer will have this. Now I'll ask Barb to make a few comments. Barb Godin : We can't go back and actually reproduce those numbers at this point in time, but again going from experience those numbers were very small. Again being very active in that space, as we mentioned, we've been doing this for 40 years and so we have run through some ups and downs and know it has not impacted our books significantly. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just finally David, a question on cards, you sound quite optimistic about your ability to continue to drive card acceptance and card usage from your customers and the branches, did I get the sense from your comments that you're thinking about potentially broadening the offering of those cards outside the branches and possibly outside your footprint? David Turner : Our focus really has been our customer base. If you -- and the reason for that is our penetration on our customer base has been right at 16%. We expect that to be in the lower 20s intact and so that's really where our focus has been. We have from a strategy standpoint thought about expanding outside of our customer base and we think right now spending the time to again serve our existing customers is probably the best route to go at this time, but it is on the drawing board for us. Grayson Hall : Well we think that's progress. We've looked at different strategies, but again cross-selling our current customer base continues to be our number one priority and we've got better at executing on that strategy. We've had -- our results continue to build momentum. We've got more active cards, more card transaction and had more success in penetrating our book and in the past and so we're encouraged by our early results and that remains our strategy. Matt Burnell : Makes sense. Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of KBW. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Chris. Chris Mutascio : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David, just a quick question, your positive operating leverage commentary clearly implies pretax, pre-provisioning earnings growth in '15, over '14. But I guess can you achieve pretax earnings growth if in indeed the provision expense inevitably reflects off the low level in fourth quarter? David Turner : Well, our goal is to constantly grow our earnings for our pretax and after tax basis. So we're working hard to grow all areas revenue, control our expense base and we think net, net we can do that from an operating leverage standpoint, but we haven\u2019t given explicit guidance as to what that pretax move will be. As we go through the year, we will give you a little more clarity on that, but we're going to stick to positive operating leverage right now is the guidance. Chris Mutascio : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the positive operating leverage guidance, that includes the branch closing cost in both fourth quarter of '14 and the potential for another $15 million first quarter '15? Is that correct? David Turner : It includes the benefit of having that out in the expense run rate, but the actual charge, the $10 million and the $15 million are adjusted out. Chris Mutascio : Okay. David Turner : So it does not include those. Chris Mutascio : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Januja of JPMorgan. Vivek Januja : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Couple of them. Oil and Gas. Can you just talk about your originations during the course of 2014 and also how much do you have in commitments over and above 3.35 or 3.35 billion of academics? Grayson Hall : The answer to your first or second question is commitments. We currently have 6.9 billion in commitments to the sector and 3.4 billion outstanding which represents about 4.4% of the portfolio. Further originations we grew both around $200 million year-over-year. It was fairly diverse group of originations both in the E&P sector and in auto services driven through the cross both states in terms of geography and through our Regions Business Capital Group which has strong relationships with private equity sponsors in that space and have pretty good year in originations as well. Vivek Januja : So would you say then - chunk of the growth came from the private equity related loans? Grayson Hall : I don't have the mix exactly. So we\u2019ll say that those relationships were certainly important to some of the growth that we generated through our Regions Business Capital Group. Vivek Januja : Okay, thanks. And one more question qualitative reserves you mentioned earlier, what is the amount of - what percentage of your loans are - what percentage we had loan last reserves qualitative reserves? Grayson Hall : We have not disclosed that. Vivek Januja : But is that something that's changed in the fourth quarter? Did it go up, down, flat any context around that? Grayson Hall : Relatively stable. Vivek Januja : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Michael Rose : Good afternoon. Just two quick ones from me. What is the reserve on the loan book - on the energy book today and maybe what was it if you know going back to 2009 when we had a similar decline in oil prices? And then just secondarily, what's the expected impact in dollars if you have it around the seasonal FICO costs that you expect in the first quarter? Thanks. Barb Godin : This is Barb Godin. If we look at the energy book we don't have it specifically that way. We do have - we look at very detail and acquire particularly if it\u2019s a non performing loans for good specific reserve. Other than that, we look at it improved loans, so we don't have competitive status, but we can is we feel very comfortable with what our book looks like, again remembering that we do a few things. We do sensitivity analysis on that book. We have a price deck. We do that pretty well in the quarterly basis but the price deck we press it down and then we pick an additional haircut on that. We also do reserve calculations with those 65% advanced rate on our reserved calculations. And last but not least we also have hedging on that book. So all in we feel pretty good about that book but again getting back to your comments both specific reserves or reserving we don\u2019t have them so we can provide you. Grayson Hall : Michael I'll take the second question. So, if you look at prior year it should be relatively consistent for file the taxes and 401-K match and those kinds of things that happened in the first quarter. They are almost up around $12 million and then remember that our pension cost increased about $6 million for quarter that you'll, that\u2019s new. Michael Rose : Okay. That's helpful. And just one more back to the energy book. What percentage of your book is hedged through 2015 and through 2016 if you have that? Thanks. David Turner : About 41% through 2015 and an additional 17% I think through 2016. Michael Rose : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : I apologize if you\u2019ve addressed this question, I need to jump off. If you look at your total energy portfolio, what percentage of that would be designated as leverage loans? Grayson Hall : We currently have seven leverage loans in our energy portfolio. Five of those are managed through our Regions business capital group and so it would be a modest percentage of our total exposure. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And is there any talk, I haven't heard this, but has there been any talk amongst the OCC or the regulators to do for the industry and not just for you folks of course, targeted energy credit exams this year. Barb Godin : We haven't heard of any that -- I would believe that they probably would just given the where things are in the energy sector, we would not be surprised. The other comment I would also make on the leverage loans we just ask that question is recognizing that definition of leverage within the overall space and how we define leverage is different. So typically as you know, leverage is defined as non-investment grade and again that is -- that's what banks our side do as we land in the non-investment grade space. Gerard Cassidy : And then finally and again I apologize if you've addressed this, as you of course is very, very strong. Do you guys get a sense that there will be at some point in the future where the regulators will allow you to reduce that to a more manageable level, so that your return on equity can obviously go higher? David Turner : Yes, Gerard, this is David. There hasn\u2019t been any explicit guidance coming from regulatory supervisors on that. I think it's incumbent upon us to ensure we have an appropriate amount of capital for the risk in our business. We clearly think we do. We think we have capital that can be more effectively deployed and I weren\u2019t on the call, we talked about easing that capital really for first off getting our dividend up to kind of our more consistent with expectations. Using that capital to grow organically using excess capital to the extent that there was an acquisition to pay cash for whether it be a bank, non-bank and they are returning in appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. We think we have the kind of capital position and we think we have a really good understanding of the risk attended to our company and therefore, we think over time you will see those drift down. Where the terminal amount is, is everybody's guess. And so I think we need not get ahead of ourselves on that, but I do think capital levels do rationalize over time. The amount of time -- when that is, is anybody's guess. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate that. Thank you. And one follow-up to your comments David, on acquisitions, not to say that you're looking at anything right now, but some of the bigger banks have commented that the BSA/AML internal reporting has been a obstacle to getting deals announced. How do you guys feel about your BSA/AML condition in terms of your systems? Obviously M&T is still struggling to close its deal that was announced over two years ago because of BSA/AML issues. Can you give us some color on where you guys think you stand in that arena? David Turner : Well I think ensuring that you have all of your key processes in order to participate in acquisitions is important. BSA/AML has been imported to our country for a long time. It will continue to get the time and attention and it's incumbent upon us to have all the controls in place. We invest an awful lot of time and attention in ensuring that and we feel like we have a very robust program relative to BSA/AML and -- but that mean we can't stop here. We have to continue to invest and continue to be diligent in terms of those processes, but we think we have a solid program today. Gerard Cassidy : Again, thank you. David Turner : You bet. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall for closing remarks. Grayson Hall : Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone's participation today and thank you for your questions and we'll stand adjourned. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Paula, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. List Underwood : Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call today. Our presenters include, Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of our management team are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our call -- earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the Appendix section of the presentation. Grayson? Grayson Hall : Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us as we review our first quarter results. First quarter results reflect a solid start to 2015, as we reported our earnings of $218 million or $0.16 per diluted share, which included $0.02 per share of significant items that negatively impacted EPS. These results illustrate that we are successfully executing our strategic priorities, which include diversifying revenue, generating positive operating leverage and effectively deploying capital. As notably, we achieved these results even with severe weather conditions in our markets during the first quarter. During the quarter, we grew loans and deposits, we grew checking accounts in all of our markets, we generated positive operating leverage, while prudently managing expenses and receiving no objection to our CCAR submission. Our loan growth in the first quarter was 1% with most loan categories experiencing growth. Deposit growth exceeded our expectations this quarter with balance still growing 3% from the end of last year. As continued evidence of our Regions360 approach to relationship banking, we grew checking accounts in all of our market and accordingly also increased our number of households. Total revenue remained relatively steady from the fourth quarter, despite seasonal declines in both net interest income and non-interest income. However, our efforts around diversifying our revenue streams helped to offset these declines. Wealth Management delivered strong results, growing revenue 8% and increasing assets under administration by 5%. While all segments within Wealth Management grew revenue, insurance was particularly noteworthy, as revenue increased 13% linked quarter. Going forward, along the organic growth, we will continue to target lift-out and acquisition opportunities in the support of business. This will also allow us to round down our product offerings and geographic coverage, and will drive incremental revenue growth. Adjusted expenses declined 2% from the fourth quarter as many of our expense categories declined. We continue to prudently manage expenses, while focusing on expenses we can control, while appropriately investing for future growth. Total expense during the first quarter was impacted by few planned actions, where we incur additional charges, but our future run rate should benefit. Let me spend a few moments and provide you with an update on energy lending portfolio. We continue to use our corporate governance process to monitor oil price declines for direct and indirect impact to our overall loan portfolio. While we have seen some downward risk breeding migration in our oil field services portfolio, we are not seeing widespread financial stress within our customers in the portfolio. Obviously, if oil prices remained at low levels for the extended period of time additional migration is likely. However, we are staying engaged with our customers and we will take necessary actions as we deem appropriate. Conversely, we believe consumers are beginning to experience benefits from lower oil prices, with consumer loan categories, net charge-offs, delinquencies and non-performing loans, all declined during the quarter. In fact, total net charge-offs to average loans is 28 basis points in the quarter, our lowest level in over seven years. Also during the first quarter, we received no objections to our planned capital action from the Federal Reserve related to our CCAR submission. We believe our plan reaffirms our commitment to effectively managing our capital is for long-term growth objectives, while also increasing returns to shareholders. It also highlights our continued long-term approach to capital allocation and distribution. As returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Our capital plan included increase in the quarterly $0.01 per share to $0.06. Additionally, we plan to repurchase $875 million of outstanding shares over the next five quarters subject to Board approval. From an economic perspective, we anticipate a growth should pick up over the remainder of the year, and we expect continued improvement in housing prices across our markets. However, we do not expect an increase in short-term rates until the later part of 2015. We will continue to leverage our Regions360 approach to relationship banking to grow and expand our customer base. In fact, during the first quarter, Regions was again recognized by leading customer experience research firms the Temkin Group and Greenwich Associates for providing industry-leading service to both consumers and businesses in 2014. We are pleased to once again be recognized for providing an exceptional customer experience. With that, I will turn it over to David. He will cover details for the first quarter. David? David Turner : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the first quarter details and then wrap up with our expectations for the remainder of 2015. Loan balances totaled $78 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $936 million or 1%. Business lending achieved solid growth that was balanced across industry segments and geographic locations. Balances in this portfolio totaled $49 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of $867 million or 2%. Investor real estate lending balances totaled $7 billion, an increase of $108 million or 2%. And commercial and industrial loans grew $949 million or 3%, and this growth was driven by our market-based corporate and commercial bankers serving small corporate and middle market clients. In addition, Regions\u2019 business capital, our asset-based lending group and corporate real estate exhibited growth during the quarter. Line utilization increased 10 basis points, commitments for new loans increased 4% and our pipelines remained strong. Moving to consumer lending, loans in this portfolio totaled $29 billion, as production increased 9% linked quarter. Mortgage loan balances increased $103 million and production increased 9% linked quarter. In addition, indirect auto lending balances increased $59 million or 2% as this portfolio continues to expand. New and enhanced consumer lending product offerings led the growth in our other consumer loan category, loan balances increased $28 million and the portfolio totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, while production also increased 58%. As expected, credit card balance declined following a seasonally high fourth quarter, balances declined $43 million or 4% from the previous quarter. However, production increased 20%. And finally, total home equity balances declined $78 million or 1%, while production also decreased 1%. Let\u2019s take a look at deposit. Supported by our multichannel platform, total deposits growth was strong, increasing $3 billion during the first quarter. Two-thirds of this growth was driven by consumer deposits, which were broad base across the majority of our markets. Deposits costs remained near historically low levels and totaled 12 basis points, while total funding costs were 29 basis points in the quarter. Let's look how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $832 million, a decline of $5 million or 1% from the previous quarter. The low rate environment and fewer days in the quarter were the principal drivers of the decrease, but were partially offset by increases in average loans and reductions of higher costs borrowings. Net interest margin increased slightly from the previous quarter to 3.18%, reflecting the benefits of reduced borrowing costs, offset by higher levels of cash due to deposit growth. Total non-interest income declined $4 million or 1% in the first quarter. Mortgage income increased $13 million or 48% as loan production increased along with improvement in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights. As Grayson noted, our Wealth Management Group delivered strong results for the quarter, revenue increased 8% led by higher insurance commissions, higher investment services fees and increases in investment management and trust income. Service charges declined $6 million from the previous quarter, which was due to a $3 million decline in fees resulting from a product discontinuation in the fourth quarter and seasonally lower non-sufficient fund fees. Card and ATM fees decreased slightly as a result of lower spending and transaction volumes that are typically experienced in the first quarter. However, the number of active accounts continued to increase. Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the first quarter were $905 million, a decline of 7%, while adjusted expenses declined 2%. During the first quarter, we redeemed $250 million of higher cost debt, incurring $43 million extinguishment charges, but earnings will benefit from a lower run rate going forward. As previously noted, in the fourth quarter 2014, we announced plans to consolidate 50 branches throughout 2015 as part of an ongoing evaluation of the branch network. We recorded $13 million of expense related to the consolidation in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we have a space planning initiative underway which will reduce occupancy expense going forward. This initiative results in an incremental charge of $9 million. Salaries and benefits remained relatively flat from the previous quarter despite a seasonal increase in payroll taxes of $11 million, which was offset by decline of $15 million in incentives that is not expected to repeat next quarter. Pension expenses increased $2 billion lower than our original estimate for the quarter and should remain at this level for the remainder of 2015. In the second quarter, we expect an increase of salaries and benefits commensurate with annual merit increases. Occupancy and furniture fixtures declined a total of $5 million and outside services declined $6 million. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses excluding the previous quarters of $100 million legal and regulatory accrual declined $15 million to $19 million for the quarter. Although there are opportunities for expense reductions, we expect expenses in this category to increase somewhat and some amount of volatility should be expected. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64.9% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from the prior period. Prudent expense management remains a top priority as we remain committed for generating positive operating leverage over time. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.7%. This rate reflects the impact of the adoption of new guidance related to the accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which increased income tax expense and non-interest income. All prior periods have been restated to conform in this new presentation. In addition, the first quarter\u2019s tax expense includes a one-time benefit related to an improved methodology to determine state deferred taxes of approximately $10 million which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 300 basis points. Moving to asset quality, total commercial and investor real estate criticized and classified loans increased $125 million or 5% from the prior quarter as the company experienced some weakening in large dollar commercial and industrial loans within the energy, healthcare and other portfolios. However, we do not believe this weakening is systemic in nature. As Grayson noted, we are closely monitoring the energy portfolio and have experienced some risk-rating downgrades this quarter. However, because the number of our energy clients are limited, we are in a position to maintain frequent contact and will continue to be diligent through our normal processes of credit servicing these loans. Compared to the prior quarter, total delinquencies declined 12% and troubled debt restructurings or TDRs declined 5%. Our non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased 3% linked quarter and at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 137%. Again as Grayson mentioned total net charge-offs declined $29 million and represented 28 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $49 million or $5 million less than net charge-offs. Given where we are in the credit cycle in the large dollar commercial credits in our portfolio along with fluctuating oil prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected. Let\u2019s talk about capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $102 million of shares of common stock which completes the $350 million program that was part of our 2014 CCAR submission. Additionally, during the first quarter, we began the transition period for the Basel III capital rules. As such, we will report Basel III capital ratios under the phase-in provisions for regulatory reporting purposes. But we will also continue to report ratios as if fully implemented. Under these new provisions, we maintained industry-leading capital levels as a tier 1 ratio was estimated at 12% and the common equity tier 1 was estimated at 11.2%. In addition, the common equity tier 1 was estimated at 10.9% on a fully phase-in basis. Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 80%. And regarding the liquidity coverage ratio rule, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation deadline. Throughout 2015, we will update customer agreements to include LCR friendly language. We will modify our existing deposit products and we also plan to create new products and services to complement our strong position of high-quality liquid assets. It is important to note that no major balance sheet initiatives are expected in order for us to be compliant.  Let\u2019s take a few minutes and touch on our expectations for the remainder of 2015. With respect to loans, we continue to expect total loan growth in the 4% to 6% range on a point-to-point basis. Commercial and industrial loans are expected to drive loan growth within the business lending portfolio. And while owner-occupied commercial real estate is not expected to provide meaningful growth, the pace of runoff is expected to slow. Looking at the consumer lending book, we expect continued growth from indirect auto lending. We will continue to focus on driving better pull-through rates, increasing margins and improving overall credit profiles. We also expect to augment growth through new partnerships later in the year. Additionally, continued growth in other consumer loans is expected. We are focused on expanding lending through online and point-of-sale financing alternatives. And as a result, we expect growth in this category to accelerate in 2015. Moving to credit card, as we remain focused on increasing our penetration rates, this should drive balance growth in the near term. And finally, we expect the pace of home equity runoff to moderate throughout the year. Regarding deposits, while we had a better-than-anticipated first quarter, we expect full year average deposit growth in the 1% to 2% range. As a reminder, a significant portion of our deposits are made up of consumer deposits, which tend to be more granular and smaller in size, which based on our research should be more stable and less rate sensitive in a rising rate environment. With respect to margin, our expectations for the year have not changed materially. We expect to drive net interest income and margin growth over the balance of the year under our baseline expectations for loan growth and an increase in interest rates late in the year. Further, we expect to benefit from revenue initiatives within mortgage, capital markets and wealth management while at the same time diligently managing expenses. That being said, we are committed to generating positive operating leverage. We believe that the first quarter was a solid start for 2015 and we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities of diversifying revenue, generating positive operating leverage and effectively deploying our capital. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. List Underwood : Thank you, David. We are now ready to begin the Q&A -- excuse me-- the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning and there are number of you in the queue, I would ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up. Now let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Grayson Hall : Good morning Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. My first question is on the $949 million in C&I loan growth in the quarter. How much of that $949 million was related to your oil and gas sector? David Turner : Erika, during the quarter, we really had kind of moved sideways in terms of our oil and gas. That was really a far broader base expansion of the loan portfolio outside of the energy sector. Erika Najarian : Great. And my follow-up question is, in terms of your guidance for positive operating leverage, it sounds like you're still accounting for some rate increases in the back half of the year, which many investors are sort of stripping out of their model. Could you still hit positive operating leverage if the Fed doesn't raise rates this year? David Turner : Erika, it would be very difficult if rates stayed in the $1.75 to $2 range. To do that, we can get close but it would be difficult. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we do expect -- we have baked in little bit of an increase in September and a little one in December. But really loan growth for us is important when we saw loan growth this quarter and deposit growth and earning asset growth. That\u2019s a pretty big positive for us going into this whole concept of generating positive operating leverage. So it\u2019s not out of the question. It does make it more difficult. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Grayson Hall : Good morning Michael. Michael Rose : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the energy topic. Can you disclose how much of this quarter's provision related to the review of the energy book? And then, where do reserves stand? And if you can\u2019t give a specific number, maybe you can give us some context as where they stand now versus maybe where they stood in \u201809 when we had a similar price decline? David Turner : Yeah. So Michael, we won\u2019t disclose the specific dollar amount attributable to this but clearly we have a process, I\u2019ve talked in the prepared comments about our servicing that we are going through. We have relatively small number of customers in this sector whether it\u2019d be our E&P customer base or oilfield services customer. So we\u2019re spending a lot of time with them and we understand where those credits are. We had some migration down. The migration you saw that was not just in the energy sector, it was other sectors. Healthcare and even some other industries that really contributed to that. But we have a very disciplined process from a lending standpoint. We do have amounts in our calculation attributable to energy. That allocation has increased as our credits continues to migrate down this past quarter. So, we feel like we have those credits appropriately reserved right now. Grayson Hall : Yeah, Mike. We\u2019ve got a very rigorous disciplined process for credit servicing and risk ratings. And obviously we saw a number of risk rating downgrades in the energy portfolio and particular in the oilfield services part of that portfolio. That being said, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in our customer selection and in our risk rating process and feel very good about where we are at today. That being said, I had asked John Turner, if he would. John runs our Corporate Banking Group here at Regions and all of our energy lending reports up to John, asking if he would make a few comments for oilfield services in particular. John Turner : Happy to. Thanks, Grayson. Just commenting from a risk mitigation standpoint with respect to oilfield services, we have been through the process of reviewing about 80% of our outstanding. We did that about 45 days ago and we do that on a quarterly basis. As a result of that review, what we observed was that about 25% of the book had previously been downgraded. Virtually all those downgrades were well within the past categories. And as a result of that quarterly review because our bankers have previously downgraded credit really didn\u2019t downgrade any additional credit. We do anticipate given what has clearly been some reduction in capital spending that in the latter part of the second quarter, the third quarter and fourth quarter, as we begin to get year end results for some of these companies, we should see some additional downward migration. But as David pointed out, we have a small group of customers that represent our exposure here. We are closer to those customers and we think they are doing the right things to manage their business in a difficult environment. Separately, we think about our reserve based lending portfolio. We have now been through the borrowing base redeterminations for 25% of our book and what we have observed is about a 20% reduction in borrowing base availability, customers still have about 40% of availability on average under the lines of credit. Half of the credits we\u2019ve reviewed have remained at their current risk rating. The other half has seen again some downward migration in risk rating but virtually all of that has been within the past category. And so we remain cautiously, comfortable with the credit exposure we have in both the reserve based lending and the oilfield services books. Michael Rose : Okay. That\u2019s great color. And then maybe as a follow-up to Eric\u2019s question who asked in a different way. If rates do stay lower for longer, what areas in the expense side would you look to maybe trim a little bit or take some more actions to maybe meet that positive operating leverage goal? Thanks. Grayson Hall : Yeah. Mike, I would tell you, we are not waiting to see what happens with the rate environment. I think being disciplined around expense management is just part of who we are. We\u2019ve talked about that for a number of years. Cleary, the big drivers for us are our three largest categories of expense -- salaries and benefits, occupancy, furniture and fixtures are the areas that you have to move the needle on to get any meaningful change. We have deployed a lot of six sigma initiatives throughout our company to improve the processes. Those process improvements are -- some of those were actually revenue enhancement opportunities but some of those are -- from a cost standpoint to control costs. We are down in headcount, a 122, from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter. And so you should see us look at those three categories and really every other one. You saw legal and professional down as we continue to watch really third-party spend. That\u2019s probably the fourth biggest one, making sure that we are -- we need a third-party that we hold them accountable. And in the good old days when we were kind of going through all the changes in the industry, we had to go hire our consultant and throw a lot of labor hours and expense to solve whatever problem we have. Today, we are little more disciplined and in terms of meeting to go out for third-parties, so that\u2019s why that cost is down. And we will continue to look at that category and outside services being quite a fit. Those were five years that we target. Michael Rose : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, guys. David, I wanted to ask about the deposit service charge line. Just in terms of the first quarter number, if you look at the 161, is that really advanced or fully out of that and should we see some -- separately some pickup seasonally from the first quarter level? David Turner : That\u2019s right. So it was embedded in that decline from the fourth quarter to the first. Half of that was already advanced, rolling out finally. We should not have anything going forward on that in the second quarter. And as you mentioned, the first quarter is a seasonal low for NSF. And so based on those, we will see what customer behavior does going forward. The good thing is we are growing accounts. So if we continue to grow accounts, service charges will be expected to grow commensurate with that. John McDonald : And then in the second half of this year, do we still expect some incremental pressure from changes in posting order and do you have any update in terms of your plans on rolling that out and timing? David Turner : We\u2019ve gone through a mile or so and our expectation is that update is still in the $10 million to $15 million per quarter range. When we implement, which we expect right now to be in the back half of the year. We have not been as definitive on that date yet, but we are continuing to go through pilots and learning. And as we get closer, we will give you more specific guidance. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. On credit, this quarter we saw the smallest release since 2011 and given your comments on what\u2019s happening with energy, is it reasonable to expect that the provisions going to start to exceed charge-offs as we look ahead to the rest of the year? Grayson Hall : Bill, I think that at this juncture what we saw this quarter is that the vast majority of our credit metrics all improved. And so we are still feeling very comfortable about the direction that our asset quality is moving. That being said, we did have pretty solid loan growth this quarter, as well as we\u2019ve discussed some risk rating downward migration of somewhat credits then I would tell you it is fairly broadened. Certainly, there were two or three credits in energy, two or three credits in healthcare and some general industries that drove that migration. But that being said, sticking to our process, sticking to our methodology, making sure we are going through that with a lot of rigor, a lot of discipline. And so when you look at the quarters going forward, we still believe that the general direction holds true that we should continue to see improvements in asset quality. That being said, you can always have, given where we are at in the cycle and given the level that our loan -- problem loans were at today, you can always have just a handful of credits spend to create some level of volatility for quarter. But we are still confident in the direction of the portfolio. David Turner : To the extent you see, we continue to see net charge-offs coming down and non-performing loans coming down. Our release was only $5 million, which dropped our coverage of loans from 143 to 140. But you could see if that continues charge-offs down and NPLs down, you could see that ratio continue to migrate down as credit continues to improve, notwithstanding Grayson\u2019s point that you can have volatility in some of this from time to time. Grayson Hall : Well, we hope that loan growth continues on a prudent and modes rate and that\u2019s going to again have to be calculated into our division expense. Bill Carcache : Understood. Thank you. The other question that I had is on the consumer side. We are seeing growth as you discussed but it looks like it\u2019s a pretty steady deceleration in credit card and indirect auto loans for the last few quarters. So it\u2019s certainly growth but decelerating year-over-year. I was hoping that you could maybe go a little deeper into both of those businesses. Should we expect that rate of growth to continue to decelerate there? Grayson Hall : Well, I think -- and I will speak and David can add to this. I think when you look at the consumer, what we\u2019ve seen is that consumer appears to be paying down debt and servicing debt at a faster rate than they were and holding more liquidity in their depository accounts. And so we are seeing a generally healthier consumer from a credit and deposit perspective. As long as the prices of the old pump stay where they are at, the gas pump stay where they are at, I think the customer has a lot more liquidity, disposable income than it previously has and they appear to be very conservative in the way they are using that. I do think when you look at the two sectors you mentioned, the credit card. We are seeing -- we are still seeing very strong production. In our credit card portfolio, we think that production does translate into an increased and outstanding balances as we go forward. But there is a lot of seasonality to credit card and we think we are seeing some of that this quarter. But we still think that we\u2019ve got -- given the growth rate of new credit cards, which is growing at about 10,000 cards this quarter, we think we\u2019ve got -- we think we\u2019ve got an opportunity there to continue to grow that portfolio. The auto sector is a little bit different question and that auto sales are still very strong, but there is more competition in that marketplace today. And we are more disciplined each and everyday in that space. And I think that our pace of growth of that portfolio has moderated, but we are still growing. And we still are active in that marketplace, which you should expect us to retain our discipline and how we lend into that space. And so we still feel good about it, but I do think the pace of growth will moderate. David Turner : Yes. I would add credit card, it\u2019s a seasonal low. If you go back and look at the trend, we are down in the first quarter historically. But, I mean, the growth over last year at the same time is 5% of credit card. And you heard the growth that we\u2019re getting on production. From an indirect standpoint, I would add a couple of things. One, we\u2019re up almost 14% if you look year-on-year. Linked quarter, it was only 1.6%. What we\u2019ve done over the past is we\u2019ve really weeded out some of the dealers we are doing business with as we believe we\u2019re getting adversely selected. Our loss rates were higher. And so we actually are down several hundred dealers. And we are looking at getting with the larger dealer groups. We worked on some Six Sigma initiatives to help us from full through rates to expand production there in the industry. The automobile industry had been in the 16 million units going to -- we\u2019ve seen estimates as high as 17 million units for this year. So we think we will get our fair share of that and look to grow indirect in '15. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Scouten : Good morning, guys. Question on kind of asset sensitivity and NIM. I mean, I know you said you\u2019re forecasting a rate increase, maybe in September and December, but would you guys foresee any changes in the way you look at your portfolio, whether it would be adding on swaps or other kind of [indiscernible] if that rate hike doesn\u2019t play out as you expect currently? Grayson Hall : Well, we ask ourselves everyday what we ought to do to manage our interest risk. And given where rates are, we believe have been and continued to believe be an asset sensitive is the right thing to do. If perhaps we got a quick rise in rates, we might want to lock in a little bit of advice to downside protection from there. That might be a time to put some interest swaps. But right now we are looking at the 10-year where it is and expecting a rate increase to come, because we do know but they are on the short rates, we are just at a kind of a false bottom. We know that has to increase and whether or not we get the long end to steep or where we have a flat yield, we don\u2019t yet know. But there will be a time when we consider that stronger than we are right this minute. We think there is more biased to up rate than there is to the down rates. Stephen Scouten : Okay. That makes sense. And then just as it pertains to kind of the balance between the loan growth that you expect to see and deposit growth, I know you said for the year maybe deposit growth should be 1% to 2%. But if you had another quarter like the strong deposit growth you saw this quarter, what would your expectation be there increased security investments or kind of how would you manage that loan to deposit ratio, where would you want that to pan out? Thank you. Grayson Hall : I mean, clearly, we look to -- we are encouraged to see deposit grow as strong as it was in this quarter. It exceeded our internal expectations but was very promising news. And with one quarter it doesn\u2019t necessarily make a trend and we are still projecting for the full year sort of a 1%, 2% deposit growth. We would love to be wrong on that and deposits exceed that, but I think we\u2019ve got to have another quarter or so before we\u2019re convinced that that is true. I do think from a loan to deposit standpoint, we certainly would like to see loan growth more robust that it is to allow us to get a better balance and come closer to peers on our loan deposit ratio. But given the growth and deposits we saw this quarter, well we backed up a 1% or so in that regard. So we are seeing strong lending pipelines and hopefully we will have -- we will see continued strength in loan demand. But I don\u2019t -- at this don\u2019t see a strong amount to offset the growth in deposits that we are seeing. David Turner : Yes. I think as a result of that, you\u2019re seeing us, our securities books still pretty high percentage of our earning asset base, little higher than we would like, but we are not going to manufacture loan growth. The loan growth is there and is prudently underwritten that we will deploy that cash there, but if not within the securities book. We have been relatively short on securities and we paid a price for that in terms of the lower NIM, but we think that\u2019s the right call. And to the extent we had deposit growth outside in that 1 to 2, that\u2019s what we would absent the loan growth. Stephen Scouten : Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, guys. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Ryan Nash : David, I was trying to get some clarity on the outlook for the net interest margin. Clearly, you are saying that there is increase for rates in your budget. But how do we think about the trajectory of the NIM before we actually get interest rates rising? And I just wanted to make sure that your guidance you gave us last quarter was still applicable. So after 10 years stays at around the current level the downside case could be 10 to 12 basis points. David Turner : Yes. Ryan, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s got a little better. We think to the extent we stay in. Again last quarter we said the 1.75% to 2% 10-year. If we took that today, that probably would be in the 9 to 10 basis point range. So that tie better than what we disclosed to you last quarter. Ryan Nash : And just the trajectory of it? David Turner : Yes. I think we would continue to have pressure leading into '16 with this low rate environment. Operator : Excuse me, this is, Operator, can you hear me? David Turner : Maintaining this low rate environment. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then just on expenses, you\u2019re obviously down year-over-year in the first quarter and you are talking about being -- remaining committed to prudent expense management. But I was just wondering given what you\u2019re doing on the branch side, you talked about reducing professional fees and you\u2019re referring something about pacing. Should we see the absolute level of expenses declined for the remainder of this year relative to 2014? David Turner : We gave you a little bit into prepared comments. We had a couple of things, so we had some benefits from -- $15 million benefit in the first quarter that offset the payroll tax increases that won\u2019t repeat. We also will have the impact of our merit increases that we gave our folks. We will have a full quarter of that. And then we had our legal and professional fees were down quite a bit from historical quarters. We think that there is some volatility there. I don\u2019t think it will be back where it was a quarter before. But I am not as confident that they could repeat at the level that we had this past quarter. So you might see a little bit of a tick up from that. But that being said, we are looking at every expense category everyday to control those going forward to '15 into '16. Ryan Nash : And David just one quick follow-up on that. When I look back on past years there is not much seasonality heading into 2Q on the comp line. I am just wondering if you maybe size for us how big of an increase we should expect for things like merit increases? David Turner : Well, if you -- we have increases been in that 2.5% range on salaries for merit and then I told you about the '15 that won\u2019t repeat. So you can do some and we had 11 million that was in there already for payroll taxes. So if you take those three things, you will get pretty close. Ryan Nash : Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim Securities. David Turner : Hi, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back on the credit quality issue. The information that you\u2019ve given about the energy portfolio is perhaps better than what we might have expected, but it sounds like maybe some of the other stuff is a little bit worse -- considering that there isn\u2019t necessarily evident pressure on other sectors of the economy. So I am wondering if you could just maybe us some insight about what\u2019s causing the negative reading of migration in areas outside of the energy portfolio. Grayson Hall : Yes. I think one things we wanted to communicate to you is that migration was really was handful of large credits and there are some in energy, some in healthcare and other industries. And really if you look behind that, it\u2019s idiosyncratic issues with each of those. There is nothing systemic with them that caused that rating downgrade. There were downgrades within the past category. You saw downgrades into classified, but there is really nothing again systemic there that causes us concern with overall portfolio. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. So just in terms -- I mean you have been very clear about your overall expectations for NPL. But I guess my -- is that just a function then of the expectation that these idiosyncratic issues have not been sort of addressed and there is nothing similar on the horizon about basically the interpretation? Grayson Hall : That\u2019s right. We feel live we\u2019ve recognized what the issues are. Clearly each of these has their own story and defending on where that story goes, you can have further downgrades through the deterioration. We are just trying to send the messages that there is nothing systemic that these are handful of credits that really caused us this issue. So hopefully, we believe we recognized the issues that are there today and where they go from here, they can get better, they might get worse and we will take up that real time and there are provisioning. But we think we\u2019ve gotten our arms around it. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Grayson Hall : Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer, if would like few comments. Barb Godin : Yeah. I just going to jump in and say, I am looking at list, what did migrate? And firstly, the majority of them are paying as agreed. We are very close to our customers in terms of the credit servicing and making sure that if we see anything at all that we will move that into a non-pass rated category until things cure themselves. But as I\u2019m looking at the reasons, they have to renew a largest contract, another was the systems issue, delay, another was billing and order processing issue, et cetera. So there is nothing that I saw in there as we -- and we do go through each and everyone of this credit prior to this call. That said, there is the warning signal or there\u2019s some emerging risk that we have to recognize. I also would anticipate that the majority of these credits will move back to a pass category in the next few quarters. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the securities portfolio, it\u2019s been about the same size and your yields actually went up a little bit sequentially. And I just wanted to understand, as you\u2019re trying to manage the rate environment, LCR, et cetera? Are your investment yields coming in higher or was there a delta in premium amortization that you could, perhaps, explain as well? Thanks. Grayson Hall : Yeah. Ken, it\u2019s a couple of things. One the day count does impact that, so we moved, I think, it was what 244 to 251 and premium amortization for us was down a little bit about $3 million, so it didn\u2019t take a whole lot to move that around a little bit. We -- I think your basis -- your question is, are we doing anything structurally different, the answer is, no. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then second question is just given -- you\u2019ve talked about this in the past as your relatively strong positioning from a capital perspective and you did do a good job in terms of raising your CCAR asked relative to prior years? But you\u2019re still sitting on a tremendous bed of excess capital? So with regards to opportunities like you did this quarter to take down the long-term debt? Can you just give us any updated thoughts on whether it\u2019s the outstanding commercial portfolios that are out there potentially or acquisition appetite? Any updated thoughts on your incremental uses of excess capital? Thanks. Grayson Hall : Yeah. So one of our three strategic pillars is really effectively deploying our capital, we did that through our 2015 CCAR as you mentioned. We do realized we have excess still and but the things we want to deploy it in, the way we think about it is, we want to deploy it in our loan growth and when we have excess after that we look to have acquisitions with this banks or non-banks. We\u2019re doing a lot of work around that. To use the excess capital I want to be real clear that we think about acquisition is more about using the excess capital, paying cash versus using our shares where they are priced today and so we\u2019re looking at that to the extent. We can do some transactions and still have some excess capital, perhaps, we will return that to the shareholders, because we don\u2019t want that denominator of the return on tangible common equity to continue to grow and accrete. We need to get that more optimize, so that we can get our return metrics where we wanted to be. It just takes time and we will get there. Ken Usdin : Thank you, Grayson. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. I want to see if you can give a little more color on loan yields in the first quarter. We saw -- heard a few increases in select portfolios, including commercial real estate, owner occupied, investor mortgage, all up -- selectively. I just want to get the drivers of that and if we should expect that such yields can remain stable or even move higher from here? Grayson Hall : John, you mentioned, so overall loan yields, you can see we\u2019re down 1 point. Some of that can be driven my mix. We\u2019re trying to stay pretty discipline with our pricing. If you look at our loan growth relative to peer all through 2014, we grew nicely at 3.6% for that year, so we\u2019re below our peers. Part of that\u2019s being disciplined in terms of what we want to put on our books and making sure we\u2019ll get paid to the risks that take. As we think about expectations for increasing or improving, the easiest portfolio for that to happen is really in our home equity portfolio, because we have -- still have a portion of our home equity portfolio that was priced at prime minus -- a half of prime minus 1 and as refinance activity takes that out, we get a little bit of an increase in home equity. You can see it was up just 1 point this past quarter. So we\u2019re really trying. I guess the main thing is we\u2019re trying to be discipline with regard to pricing, but I would not expect any major increase in loan yields over the near-term. David Turner : And John, I just think you have to -- we\u2019re trying to remain very discipline around loan pricing and I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job there. That being said, it\u2019s a very competitive marketplace today and you are trying to book the prudent loans that you have the opportunity too. But with the level of competition in the market it\u2019s hard to move those rates up, absence some kind of interest rate increase. John Pancari : Right. But, I guess, what I was getting and also is that, if you look at the linked quarter change in the portfolio yield for your commercial real estate, mortgage, owner occupied, as well as the non-owner occupied portfolios. They actually saw an increase linked quarter in the average yield and just wondering how you accomplish that? David Turner : They also do it and predominantly there\u2019s some mix of loans in those categories as we got new and renewed production. Grayson Hall : And if you look at the pure dollars they\u2019re in our supplement, you\u2019ll see that the interest income from those portfolios remained relatively the same. And in the case of investor real estate mortgage we had some properties that rolled out the portfolio that we\u2019re at lower rates than what we are going on. So it just looks a lot, we increased, not sure, a 10 basis points, but look at the income is really only a $1 million difference, so it get a little bit of an anomaly when you look at it just quarter-to-quarter. John Pancari : Okay. And then my second topic was just around the credit deterioration again in the healthcare and other portfolios. And all -- were they share national credits at all? And then separately, what was the average size of those credits that moved on the classified status? Barb Godin : Yes. So, handful of them were shared national credits. In fact, the majority of them were shared national credits that did move, wherein we don\u2019t leas any of those shared national credits. And in terms of the average size, it would be approximately $30 million each. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I just had a question around the debt refinancing. You have a stack of -- high cost debt behind what you just refi and I\u2019m wondering what your though are on continuing that process? Grayson Hall : Betsy, so, we -- the remaining debt that we have is really tied to capital instrument. So anything that\u2019s a capital instrument has to be subject to the CCAR process. As we think about -- have thought about that, we want to be careful in terms of just getting high cost debt, it\u2019s uneconomical. In other words, the payback period advance so excessively long would make sense to us. If you recalculate the payback period on what we did take out between two, three years, so that works for us, when you start going out, six and seven, eight, nine years, is just doesn\u2019t make it worth our while. Notwithstanding the fact, we know we have excess capital, but we just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right things for us to do. Go ahead. Betsy Graseck : I was just going to say, if the rate environment continues to stay lower for longer or tougher for longer, doesn\u2019t the math start to work in your favor to take down some more of this debt? Grayson Hall : If it\u2019s lower, it actually -- it still works against us because we maybe able to get an issue out there that\u2019s fairly cheap relative to what we have. The premium that you have to pay to take it out is just enormous and that\u2019s really where we get stripped up. If we get the holders to take it without a premium it would be good. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Unlikely to happen. Thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt Burnell : Good morning, folks. Just I have a question on the deposit growth, which you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times. And perhaps this is specific to David\u2019s comments about retail deposits. But it look like the non-interest bearing deposits balances were up about $1.8 billion on an end of period basis, which has been up only about $300 million on an average basis. What\u2019s going on there and does that have any implication for your outlook for deposit growth in the next couple of quarters? Grayson Hall : Yeah. I mean, we spend a lot of time. You are obviously analyzing the deposit growth. And I think the good news is what we\u2019ve found is that the growth has been broad across our markets. It was not isolated to a particular market or a group of markets but was fairly broad based and across markets that we serve. To David\u2019s point a moment ago, we are growing accounts and growing households that are banking with us. And so we\u2019re obviously starting to see the benefit of that. But most of our growth, as you\u2019ve seen was in the low cost deposit or non-interest bearing deposit categories, which is some of the more favorable deposit mix that we could have hoped for. We do know that there is some seasonality to these deposits. There is tax reforms that are occurring for consumers today. We also know that the consumer is having a fairly substantial benefit and reduction in gasoline prices that they are having to pay. When you aggregate all that, consumers, as we mentioned are really servicing and paying down consumer debt in a much more productive manner this quarter than we\u2019ve seen last quarter. And we also are seeing much more liquidity on the part of those consumers. So it\u2019s a behavioral change at least for this quarter that we\u2019ve seen in our consumer base. I think we\u2019ve got to have a little more time before we absolutely agree that, that\u2019s a behavioral change with some link to it. But so far it\u2019s a very promising start in 2015. In that regard, we\u2019ve just got to see how well it holds up. Matt Burnell : Okay. And David, a quick administrative questions for you. In terms of the branch consolidation charge this quarter, you mentioned that was related to your plans to reduce branches by about 50 this year. Should we expect future charges along those lines, or is that it for this year related to the 50 you\u2019ve mentioned? David Turner : We don't have any current plans for further consolidation at this time. That being said, we constantly look at our network, including where we might want to consolidate, where we might want to build new branches. We still believe that is a very important channel for our customer base. And so while we don't have plans today, we will continue to look at refining and to the extent we see opportunities to consolidate, we\u2019ll do so. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Paul. Paul Miller : Yeah. Thank you very much. Most of the questions have been already asked. But I want to ask a little bit about the mortgage side of business. One of your competitors in your region was seeing very strong purchase production of growth over the last couple of months, especially out of State of Florida. Can you add any color around that, have you seen the same thing? David Turner : We have. If we look at our production, you can see it in our supplement. But our production from a purchase standpoint was 60% of our volume and refi 40. So, we're seeing a strong purchase. It was down a little bit for us in the first quarter relative to the fourth. Refis really picked up, given the rate environment that we saw and we like that volume that we are seeing going into the quarters. So, we are looking for a continuation of improvement throughout the year in particular next quarter, but it\u2019s fairly consistent with what you're describing. Grayson Hall : I mean all of the -- all the metrics that we are following in the mortgage business were positive at the moment. We like most people anticipate a very strong second and third quarter. The mix shift in the purchase versus refinance moved around a little bit on this quarter because of the rate flow but overall much better picture in the mortgage business. Paul Miller : Okay. Hey guys. Thank you very much. Grayson Hall : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello there. You\u2019ve talked a couple of times this year about the opportunity to acquire some servicing assets on the mortgage side. Could you just give an update on your appetite there and how that fits into your broader thoughts on deployment of capital? David Turner : Yeah. So the three pillars to our strategy as we mentioned, one of them is diversifying revenue and the other one is deploying capital. Positive operating leverage is third one in the middle. So if you think about diversifying revenue for us, we believe we have a competitive advantage in servicing. We are very good at it. It\u2019s a low cost operation for us and we have room to put that on our books even though capital charge coming through in Basel III is a little more onerous. We believe that\u2019s a good use of our capital and have been looking for portfolios to purchase. But we aren\u2019t going to buy descending portfolio. We want to buy portfolios in our market and we want a portfolio where there just can be our customers. We did do one deal of $406 million, but we are out there looking. There are a lot of -- there are people shopping some today that we\u2019ve taken a look at. But we are pretty strict in terms of what we are willing to take on. Geoffrey Elliott : And then in terms of the size of portfolios that you are looking at, can you give us a sense on that? David Turner : Yeah, the sense of the portfolios that we are looking at? Geoffrey Elliott : Yeah. David Turner : Well, we want them to be on our footprint. Geoffrey Elliott : The size -- sorry, the size of the portfolios? David Turner : Yeah. Somewhere in the $500 million to a $1 billion dollar range is what we\u2019ll be looking at. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Grayson Hall : Good morning Marty. Marty Mosby : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. David, I had a very technical kind of accounting. When you talk about the affordable housing, you talked about the increase in the tax rate and then you talked about an increase in fee income I think. Was there just a compression of fee income from the affordable housing because I\u2019ve seen it in expenses and not income? So, I just wanted to make sure that was the right geography? David Turner : Yeah. It\u2019s an income for us, Marty. It\u2019s an offset. It had been an offset to income historically for us when we adopted the accounting literature. We took that offset which was a debit and we moved that down to the tax line. So it actually improved our NIR and it -- our tax expense also went higher about that 300 basis I\u2019ve mentioned. So it\u2019s just geography. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then the other thing that I was looking at was, we\u2019ve kind of head up what you might call a stall point here with a couple of issues creating some headwinds, one of them the catalysts that you are really looking for besides rates that could create the next earnings momentum for you over the next year or two. Thanks. David Turner : Well, I think that deploying our capital is important too. There is no single one thing that we knock it out in the park. It\u2019s doing a lot of things well. It\u2019s executing our business plans. It\u2019s containing to grow loans and deposits. It\u2019s continuing to deploy our capital, looking at acquisitions from banks and non-banks, making the investments in people. You can look at wealth management as a prime example of. We\u2019ve taken the medicine and making investments in people knowing that it\u2019s going to take to generate revenue. We believe further investment in those people in wealth management as a example. It is the right thing to do. There are other businesses we are looking at doing the same thing too. Capital markets is an area where we\u2019d like to expand and be larger in as we differentiate or diversify away from spread. And so we are like you, we are not sitting here waiting for rates to bail us out. We are making -- we are making a difference by growing these revenue sources, watching our expenses as we go, but needing to make the investments of dollars to generate revenue growth. Grayson Hall : Yes. But Marty I think it\u2019s a great question and a very relevant question where the industry is right now. And quite honestly, we don\u2019t see some one thing that we could do that would alter our power momentum. What we are committed to is very steady and consistent progress in strengthening our balance sheet, strengthening our business. And we had over the last couple of years really trying to put in a whole new set of strategies for how we grow our core business and we are starting to see the fruits of that labor and that we are seeing growth more broadening across our markets and more broadly across our product lines. We obviously are augmenting our product lines and we are augmenting number of people we are partnering with to grow our business. But I think to David\u2019s point the biggest thing that would help from earnings standpoint is the rate environment, but we can\u2019t wait on that, we can\u2019t depend on that. And plus our core business is really the long-term sustainable help for the company. And so I think you are going to continue to see us very broadly in a diversified way continue to try to grow all aspects of our business. And if we can do that in a very steady and consistent manner, I think we\u2019ve got a very sustainable business model and one where shareholders benefit long-term. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Grayson. Question David, you were talking about using the excess capital to potentially buy portfolios or even obviously give it back to shareholders. But you did also mention that your primary purpose is to grow the loan portfolio of course. If we put aside your excess capital that you have today and we just look at your ongoing earnings, how much loan growth do you need every year to optimize the excess capital you create every year so you don't need to go out and buy a portfolio or buy another bank? David Turner : Yes. That's a great a question. I think if you looked at our generation, you could almost have a third of that be used, 30%, 40% of that be used up for loan growth, you are going to have 30% of 35%, maybe 40% in dividends over time. And then the other would be return to the shareholders. That\u2019s kind of what the math would lead you to. But we want to grow we have -- we do have the excess and we have to put that to work. But outside of excess, I think it\u2019s almost third to third to third. Gerard Cassidy : And when you look at the third for a loan growth, what kind of loan growth would you need to use that third of the capital, is it 8% or 9% per annum or 3% or 4%? David Turner : Yes. It\u2019s in that 4%, 5% range. Gerard Cassidy : Good. And then circling back to your syndicated loans, of the oil presence or energy presence that you have with that portfolio of over $2 billion if I recall, how much of that is in syndicated loans? And second as part of that, is your approach -- when one moves into a classified category, is your approach to a syndicated loan where you are a participant different than your approach when it's not a syndicated loan and you are the lead and you are working with the customer? Barb Godin : Firstly, the majority of our product in energy is syndicated loan, I believe that roughly 86% are syndicated. Secondly, we are the lead versus the participant irrespective. We are still required even at the participant to make sure we have all of the appropriate information about that customer. We work with the agents and we make our own determination as to what that risk rating should be. And it can be different from the agent. Often, it is not different from the agent however and they are think that once a year typically during the Shared National Credit exam. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Sameer Gokhale : Hi. Thank you. Good morning or afternoon here. I had a question about the pull-through rates on any or indirect auto business again, just so we visit that. I think you had mentioned that you\u2019re doing some Six Sigma initiatives there and that\u2019s led to some improvement in pull-through rates. But I was curious if those -- that improvement was related to maybe any sort of bottlenecks in terms of your ability to underwrite those loans, have you automated the underwriting? Or can you just tell us specifically what you may have changed there that\u2019s helped improve pull-through rates? Grayson Hall : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. So I had mentioned earlier we deployed our Six Sigma teams throughout the banks. Some of them are revenue producers and some of them are expense management. This particularly one was revenue producing and what we have found is that they analyzed our process and noted that in some cases when an application would come through our sender that it would get kicked out for certain underwriting exceptions that would then force a human being to look at the underwriting and force that person to make a decision whether or not they are going to approve it. And by the time that happens that deals already being done with the dealer, because the dealer requires speed of execution. So what we did is we found that those cases where an underwriter is approving the deal, we changed our algorithm to build into that, the acceptance so that it wouldn\u2019t kick out. And that improved -- that one change improved our pull-through rate quite substantially. And that was a big driver of our increase in revenue over the past couple of quarters. Grayson Hall : We really try to focus our teams on the larger dealer groups. And if you look at this business, obviously quality of answer is important, quality of answer is important both to the customer, to the dealer, and to us. But the speed of answer is also very critical. And so we\u2019ve worked on both. We\u2019ve greatly improved our quality of answer and we\u2019ve greatly improved our speed of answer, all through automation and also in terms of bargaining, who we want to do business with. And from a dealer standpoint -- and so that rationalization of how we do business and who we do it with has made a tremendous difference in our pull-through rates. Sameer Gokhale : That\u2019s very interesting. Thank you. And then just another question, in terms of the consolidation of your bank branches, I think, it sounded like more or less done based on your guidance 50 branches, but could look at ongoing opportunities. But are you using any sort of Six Sigma initiatives there also to rationalize these branches? And as you think about consolidating these branches or the process that you follow, to what extend do you look at just a kind of the marginal profitability, so marginal revenue minus marginal cost, because it seems like you probably have a lot of centralized technology and IT cost that is spread across the branches. And to the extent, you shut down these branches, if they\u2019re marginally profitable then you don\u2019t get to leverage those technology costs. So are the efficiency items more important, do you look at marginal revenue, marginal costs and how do you think about that? Grayson Hall : Yeah. I mean -- first of all our branch rationalization process is the continuous process. And we\u2019re constantly looking at transaction activities, marginal cost, marginal profitability, and trying to figure out what the -- our branches deliver in terms of direct contributions, making sure that all of our branches are profitable on direct basis. And -- but when you look at the analytics of the branch system and where we consolidate and where we expand, that process is very comprehensive. And you have to factor in the relevance of branch, because still 80% of our new account sales come from the branch offices. And so we are very careful to determine if we consolidate the branch, how many of those customers do we lose that has a lot to do with where they\u2019re being consolidated into, how far away that receiving branch is from the consolidated branch. We also have to factor in the community impact of that even though lot of our customers bank with us over digital channels. That bank branches is still a community asset and it\u2019s still an asset that that community values and we have to think through all of those issues before we consolidate. We have tried to really still be engaged in all of our communities and deliver service in all our communities. We try to do that the most efficient way we can. So those analytics are comprehensive and they have done on ongoing basis. And we think that while we\u2019ll continue to see consolidation opportunities, we also see the need where some communities need more branches. And so on a net-net basis when we think about it, we are not sure that our number of branches over time diminishes that much. In fact, we think over the next few years we\u2019ll be relatively stable. Well, we don\u2019t let the analytics drive that. And so we let the analytics tell us whether we ought to expand and whether we ought to contract. Sameer Gokhale : Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate the explanation. Operator : Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS. David Eads : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You have given some pretty good color on various kind of line items in loans. But I was wondering if you talk a little about what you are seeing in the real estate constructing portfolio, you\u2019ve guys have had some pretty strong growth there recently. Just curious, how big that can get and how kind of what trends you are seeing there? John Turner : Yeah. This is John Turner. When you speak about construction, I guess, you mean overall just generally in the portfolio, I would say. David Eads : In the -- in the investor real estate construction line? John Turner : Yeah. So we very focused on managing that exposure fairly tightly as high resource across all the markets that we do business in. Majority of the exposure would break down between homebuilder finance, which is $700 million plus portfolio and there are multi-family business. And I think what you are saying is that portfolio grows, it\u2019s funding under previously approved construction facilities really have not been originating a lot of additional multi-family credit over the last six plus months. And so primarily the growth is fundings under a portfolio that currently has duration of about 23 plus or minus months. So fairly short duration, a lot of turnover and again we\u2019re managing as a very finite resource given what we believe is some softness in a few of the markets that we operate in. David Eads : All right. So we sort of expect that growth to taper off here pretty quickly? John Turner : I would say, yes, expected to moderate. David Eads : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Grayson Hall : Good afternoon. Vivek Juneja : Good afternoon, John and Grayson. So look at your efficient ratio. Perhaps back the $50 million your core efficiency ratio 66%, was it similar to last quarter and a year ago? And we factor in the deposit advance -- sorry, not the deposit but NSF fee decline that you\u2019re already seeing in the second half. It seems to me, is going to be tough to go much below this, even though you\u2019re working on cost cuts and just continued improvement. Can you walk through what else you need to do to try and get the efficiency ratio really down materially? David Turner : Well, we have focused on our efficiency ratio, the big driver there is revenue generation. And we made the investments we talk about the growth that we seen in NIR. We\u2019ve seen the loan grows as our revenue grows and it takes a little bit of pressure of the expense side, but we\u2019re working on that, too. If we take all three -- two revenue improvements in NII and NIR, and work it on expense, we do expect the efficiency ratio to drift down but our goals is to get down into lower 60s. We really want to be in the 55 to 59 range but we\u2019ll have to have a rate increase to get there. So absent that we would be in the -- we expect to be in lower 60s. So it\u2019s a focus every day. Vivek Juneja : Lower 60s even post the NSF reduction, David? David Turner : With a rate increase, yes. Vivek Juneja : With the rate increase. Okay. Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. I believe that is the last question. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time and attention today. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. List Underwood : Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call today. Our presenters this morning are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix section of the presentation. Grayson? Grayson Hall : Thank you, List and good morning everyone. We are pleased you could join us for today\u2019s call. Second quarter results reflect our continued momentum in 2015 as we reported earnings of $269 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. These results demonstrate we are successfully executing our strategic priorities. In the second quarter, we experienced increases in metrics that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including households, checking accounts, credit card accounts and Regions360 relationship. This growth has been broad-based geographically as all of our areas continued to expand and deepen relationships through our needs-based approach to relationship banking. Total revenue was particularly strong as both net interest income and non-interest income grew. Benefiting net interest income was loan growth of 2% and production increases of 28% and our pipelines continued to expand. Business lending growth was achieved by all three businesses : commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking. Within real estate, real estate corporate banking and our REIT business growth was particularly strong. Commercial and corporate growth reflects the strength of our business model as local bankers\u2019 partner with industry and product specialists, particularly in Regions Business Capital, government institutional banking, healthcare and restaurant banking to grow our loan portfolio. We also had a strong quarter in consumer lending with growth in every loan category. Of note, the home equity portfolio balances increased for the first time in more than 6 years. Also, new point-of-sale loan product offerings drove additional growth in consumer lending. Further, we continued to diversify non-interest income as most categories achieved growth in second quarter demonstrating that Regions360 and our investments are beginning to pay off. Adjusted non-interest revenue increased 7% from the previous quarter, reflecting growth in mortgage, capital markets and card and ATM fees in addition to deposit-related service charges. We continued to refine our retail network strategy as we identified certain parcels of undeveloped land that have been purchased for future branch expansion. We no longer intend to build on these sites, which resulted in additional expense in the second quarter. At the same time, our occupancy expenses declined due in part to branch consolidations executed in prior periods. This quarter also included some legal and regulatory-related matters that impacted earnings. First, we recorded a charge related to a contingent legal and regulatory item for previously disclosed matters. And second, we received an insurance recovery related to the settlement of a previously disclosed class action lawsuit. During the quarter, asset quality was stable to improving. Net charge-offs, non-performing loans, troubled debt restructurings all declined. The provision for loan losses increased and exceeded net charge-offs. This increase was primarily attributable to loan growth and reflects the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. We are continuing to monitor our energy portfolio and have experienced some downward risk rating migration. If oil prices remain at low levels for an extended period of time, additional migration is likely. We are however staying engaged with our customers and taking necessary actions as appropriate. Before I turn it over to David, let me mention that we are extremely proud that we were the recipient of two prestigious honors this quarter. First, we were recognized by the Reputation Institute and the American Banker Magazine as having the highest reputation with our customers among U.S. banks. And second, we were honored by Gallup as one of the Best Places to Work. These honors provided strong evidence that our focus on building a culture based on our core values is resonating with our associates and with our customers. We are also focused on delivering strong financial results and equally important is how we obtain these results. The principle is central to fulfilling our mission of creating share value for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to David who will cover the details for the second quarter. David Turner : Thank you and good morning everyone. I will take you through the second quarter details and then wrap up with our expectations for the remainder of 2015. Loan balances totaled $80 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $1.9 billion or 2% from the previous quarter. Year-to-date, loans have increased $2.8 billion, or 4%. Business lending achieved solid growth as balances in this portfolio totaled $51 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 3%. Linked quarter production was strong, increasing 29%. Commercial and industrial loans grew $1.7 billion, or 5%. And as Grayson noted, all three businesses within business lending experienced growth. Also, line utilization increased 97 basis points and commitments increased 3%. Consumer lending also had a strong quarter. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 2% and production increased 24% linked quarter. Mortgage loan balances increased $171 million and production increased 26% linked quarter. Indirect lending for vehicles increased 2% as production increased 12% and other indirect lending increased $111 million linked quarter and was driven by new partnership that focuses primarily on home improvement retailers. Now, looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 3% from the previous quarter and our penetration rate now stands at 16.4%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year. And finally, total home equity balances increased $45 million from the previous quarter as new production outpaced portfolio runoff in the second quarter. Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Supported by our multi-channel platform, average deposit balances totaled $97 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion during the second quarter. Deposit costs remained near historical low levels at 11 basis points, while total funding costs were 25 basis points in the quarter. And let\u2019s look how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $839 million, an increase of 1% from the previous quarter. Driving this increase was an additional day in the quarter, higher loan balances and a decrease in the cost of wholesale borrowings. This was partially offset by the continued low rate environment and modest compression of spreads in the loan book. The net interest margin was primarily affected by pressure on asset yields, resulting in a 2 basis point margin decline to 3.16%. Total non-interest income increased $120 million, which included $90 million related to insurance proceeds received in the second quarter related to a previously disclosed matter we accrued for in the fourth quarter of 2014. And this matter settled during the second quarter. Excluding this item, adjusted non-interest income was robust, increasing 7%, reflecting our investment in and commitment to diversifying and growing fee-based revenues. Mortgage had a solid quarter as income increased 15%. Loan production volume and market valuation of mortgage servicing rights also improved. Capital markets was a significant contributor with a $7 million quarter-over-quarter increase in fees. This was primarily related to the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers, an increase in broker dealer revenue associated with corporate fixed income underwriting and the successful completion of our first M&A advisory engagement. Card and ATM fees increased 6% as a result of increased debit and credit card usage as customer spending increased 7% and transactions increased 9% over the prior quarter. Commercial credit fee income increased from the previous quarter due to the reclassification from net interest income. This lowered net interest income by $3 million, and the future run rate of commercial credit free income should be approximately $20 million. And finally, service charges increased 4%. Now let\u2019s move on to expenses, total reported expenses in the second quarter were $934 million, which included two charges totaling $75 million. First, as Grayson mentioned, we transferred some properties originally purchased for future branch sites to held for sale and incurred a $27 million write-down. Second, professional legal expenses totaled $71 million. However, this included $48 million net accrual for contingent legal and regulatory items for previously disclosed matters. Importantly, based on current information, we expect the estimate of recently possible contingent losses to decrease by a significant amount. Salaries and benefits increased 4% from the previous quarter. Annual merit increases impacted expenses along with an increase in incentive compensation. This increase is partially due to unusually low incentives in the first quarter as well as additional incentives tied to revenue growth. Outside services increased $9 million, partially related to fees paid in connection with revenue generation as well as increases in our other costs associated with risk management activities. However, due to the nature of these expenses, we believe there are opportunities for improvement going forward. Deposit administrative fees declined from the first quarter primarily due to refunds from prior periods and the expected run rate for this line item is in the low $20 million range. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64.5% in the quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points from the prior period, as we continue to make investments in talent and technology for future revenue growth and long-term efficiencies. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.1%, which included a benefit of $7 million related to the conclusion of state and federal tax examinations. Excluding this benefit, our income tax rate would have been 31.8%. And moving on to asset quality, total net charge-offs declined $8 million and represented 23 basis points of average loans, an improvement of five basis points. The provision for loan losses was $63 million, exceeding net charge-offs by $17 million. And as Grayson mentioned, this increase was primarily attributable to loan growth and reflects the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Our allowance for loan losses was 1.39% at the end of the second quarter, down one basis point from the end of the first quarter. Total commercial and investor real estate criticized and classified loans increased $126 million or 5% from the prior quarter. However, they remain relatively flat as a percentage of total loans. The increase was driven by some weakening in large within the energy and other portfolios. Compared to the prior quarter, troubled debt restructurings or TDRs declined 7% and our non-performing notes decreased 6% linked quarter. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance for non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 149%. And given where we are in the credit cycle, the large dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility and certain credit metrics can be expected. Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $172 million or 17 million shares of common stock and declared dividends of $80 million. During the quarter, we returned 94% of earnings back to shareholders. And under the Basel III provisions, we maintained industry-leading capital levels as the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 12% and common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11.2%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 83%. And regarding the liquidity coverage ratio, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation deadline. It is important to note that no major balance sheet initiatives are expected in order for us to be compliant. So let me give you a brief review of the expectations for the remainder of 2015. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 4% to 6% range on a point-to-point basis. However, if current momentum continues, we should skew towards the higher end of that range. Regarding deposits, we continue to expect full year average deposit growth in the 1% to 2% range. And with respect to margin, our expectations for the year are essentially unchanged and we look for margin to remain relatively stable over the balance of 2015. However, we anticipate net interest income growth under our baseline expectations for loan growth and an increase in interest rates later in the year. Finally, we expect to continue to benefit from revenue initiatives, while at the same time, prudently managing our expenses and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. The second quarter was evidence of our continued momentum in 2015 and we remain focused on executing our financial priorities of diversifying revenue, generating positive operating leverage and effectively deploying our capital. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I will turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. List Underwood : Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit your self to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now let\u2019s open up the line for questions, operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Grayson Hall : Good morning John. John Pancari : Good morning. Question on the margin again, Dave thanks for the guidance there \u2013 for your expectations for relatively stable, just \u2013 how would you define that, is that give or take a couple of basis points and if so is it fair to assume just given this rate environment, that we continue to see some modest degradation, maybe a couple of bps a quarter or so, until we get the Fed really move in? David Turner : So John, you are right. We have tried to maintain the definition of relatively stable throughout this last year or so as one to two points either side of where we are right now. And so when we say that that\u2019s what we are looking for the remainder of the year, obviously if we get rates turning on us a little bit and we have the loan growth send the message on the NII growth that we expect to have. And we should see margin move in that direction. But right now, our call is relatively stable for the remainder of the year. John Pancari : Okay, alright. And then separately on the expense side, I know you had initially given some efficiency ratio expectations and you are talking about the low-60s by the end of \u201815 and I am wondering how you feel about that at this point and then also, high-50s or so in \u201816, I am wondering if that is still something that you view as achievable. David Turner : Yes. We have continued to target being in the lower-60s. To get into the 50s, we do need to have a rate increase for that. Clearly, we need two things to happen, revenue increases and continued focus on expense management to get our efficiency ratio down. And we had a 40 basis point improvement in the quarter. And I think with our internal focus on expense management and continuing to make investments in the right areas to grow our revenue, things are working out. We are moving in that direction. So, to get into the lower 60s will require us to continue on the path that we are on right now. John Pancari : Okay. And on that, the low 60s, you don\u2019t need higher rates, any kind of rate hike to get to that though? David Turner : We \u2013 like I said, we have forecasted to have rate increase this year and that is in our discussion and conclusion on improvement from here of our efficiency ratio. John Pancari : Okay. Alright, thanks David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Stephen Scouten : Yes, hi. Thanks guys. I was wondering if you could give us some more color around your existing SNC portfolio, what the overall size of that portfolio is and kind of what concerns you might have coming off that SNC exam? Grayson Hall : Okay. If you will, I will ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer, to make a few comments on that and John Turner, Head of Corporate Banking Group. The two of them can provide color on that. Barb Godin : The overall size of our outstanding SNC portfolio is roughly in the $16 billion range. But as it relates to the results of the SNC exam so that cannot be disclosed, that is confidential supervisory information. So, I would not say much more about that. But we are comfortable with the book in terms of the credit quality that we see in that book. It\u2019s very well rated. I will turn it over to John Turner to make a few more comments. John Turner : Yes. Just in general terms, the SNC book represents a little less than 45% of our total commitments within corporate banking group. We do think it\u2019s an important part of our business. It\u2019s a business that we have grown some clearly over the last two or three years. And it\u2019s a business we think that will provide us significant revenue opportunities. As we talk about shifting the mix of revenue within the company, one of our key focuses is to grow our corporate banking to grow our capabilities to serve those customers that we are now interacting with in a more significant level as part of the Shared National Credit portfolio. So, we view it as being very strategic and giving us an opportunity to grow significant relationships with customers who can drive NRR. Stephen Scouten : Okay. And then maybe one other question here, just in regards to other opportunities for capital deployment, what are you guys thinking about from an M&A perspective at this point in time? Are there any increased conversations or increased desire on you all\u2019s part to get something done in that regard, especially given BB&T the approval of their Susquehanna deal? Does that give you any greater level of confidence or move up the timeline for potential M&A for you guys? David Turner : Well, I think the first and foremost, we are focused on organic growth. We are focused on executing our business strategies and trying to build a better bank and have a better team. We are closely monitoring all M&A activity. We are preparing ourselves in the eventuality that opportunities present themselves. We think that some of the activities in the M&A spaces of late have been constructive. We think that\u2019s helpful as we sort of prepare our long-term strategies. That being said, at this juncture, our efforts are predominantly around preparation if opportunities present themselves, but our primary focus is growing organically. Stephen Scouten : Okay, thanks guys. I appreciate taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions on credit quality, you were very clear on the dynamics about what led to this quarter\u2019s provision. But as I look at the relationship of the reserve to loans, it seems to be stabilizing at around the 1.4% level, whereas some peers have continued to take it down closer to 1.25%. And I am just wondering what you sort of view as adequate going forward if there isn\u2019t any incremental migration in the SNC portfolio? David Turner : So, it\u2019s David. We don\u2019t have any particular percentage that we aim for. We let the model run. There is obviously some judgment at the end of the day, but a lot of it is model-driven. When you have 23 basis points worth of charge-offs and that can continue \u2013 if that continues over time, you should see a migration down to some point. I will tell you the loan growth we have had have been larger commercial credits. We tried to give you some color on the volatility that you can expect when you have larger credits and one of them trends negatively. We have \u2013 we feel good about the reserve. We feel good about our overall credit quality and trends and our non-performer is coming down. And \u2013 but we also have loan growth that we have to provide for. When you mix all that together, if we can continue to see a reduction in non-performers and a reduction in charge-offs, you would expect the coverage to come down, but we need to see that on a quarter-by-quarter basis and let our model run. Grayson Hall : No, it\u2019s got to be \u2013 we are committed to a very data-driven process and we are letting the data drive that number. We are \u2013 as David said, we are not targeting a particular ratio. But instead, we are targeting a process where we evaluate the credit quality of our portfolio and let the data drive that decision. Barb Godin : However, I don\u2019t think it will go back to the old days of the goal of 1%. There will be a new floor established at some point, but it will not go back we don\u2019t believe to those pre-recession levels. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thanks. That\u2019s very clear. And just one quick follow-up obviously an outstanding quarter on the brokerage and investment banking line item, how do you suggest we think about sort of the sustainable run-rate of revenues in those business lines going forward? Grayson Hall : Well, there is really \u2013 I think in a lot of ways, it\u2019s very important quarter for us. We really saw growth across \u2013 more broadly across our markets and more broadly across products. We have been making a number of investments in parts of our business that grow non-interest revenue. We have really started to see the traction that those businesses are able to gain in this market. We believe that their contributions will continue to increase. And when you look at the growth across the company, it\u2019s very encouraging, just starting to be reflected into the numbers, but very promising as we look forward. And David, do you want to chime in a little more over? David Turner : Yes, we were encouraged with \u2013 as Grayson mentioned, we have made investments in people. We got our first M&A transaction. We are looking at growing that space. We have made an investment in the Fannie Mae DUS license not quite a year ago. That\u2019s paying off for us. So, these investments that we have made, we feel good about the continued improvement. There was nothing in revenue that causes us to believe there was a one-time issue there in terms of favorability that won\u2019t repeat. We are looking to continue to grow that. The pace of which depends on the businesses that we can execute. So, we are very encouraged by that in our NRR growth and how broad it was. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you guys provide the premium amortization within the bond book this quarter and maybe how that compares to previous periods? David Turner : So, we are at $41 million this past quarter, Matt. It was about $2 million different than previous quarter. Matt O\u2019Connor: $2 million lower, I would assume? David Turner : That\u2019s right. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just I mean looking forward, does that drop more significantly if the backup in rates holds here? David Turner : I think we are showing a relatively stable kind of a moderation of that premium amortization from here. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And just I mean in terms of why that would be, is it just \u2013 there are some banks out there where it\u2019s really sensitive quarter-to-quarter and I think yours incorporates both the rate outlook and the actual prepayment. So, is it just a little bit of a smoother impact than maybe some other banks? David Turner : Yes, I think others can have a different method of amortization. Ours are fairly \u2013 should be fairly resilient, like I said from here. We used to have our premium amortization was a much bigger impact to us, but our total premiums that exist in the book is down. We also have more 15-year product, so it\u2019s a little less impactful to us than perhaps some others. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately the deposit service charges, obviously nice bounce linked quarter there, probably on seasonality, but as you think about you implementing some of the changes you have talked about, I think it\u2019s the high to low and some other, just provide an update of that, the magnitude and the timing and if there has been any change versus what you thought maybe six months ago? David Turner : So, our service charge \u2013 that was seasonality that you saw, if you compare it year-over-year, the main difference between the prior year had already advanced product in there that you know we are out of that product now. We have continued to investigate changing of our posting order. We still are committed to that effect on us. When we implement, being the $10 million to $15 million range, we expect to implement that towards the latter part of the year, so we haven\u2019t changed our timing from our last call. But you should see that go in the latter part of this year. So there will be some impact in \u201815. Grayson Hall : Additionally, Matt, we have seen steady growth in consumer checking accounts since the first of the year. And so as we continue to grow accounts and that gives us an opportunity to continue to grow that line item, so pretty encouraging news in that regard. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Sameer. Sameer Gokhale : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the last question you got, the follow-up on that, to clarify I think that you have switched or switching to a chronological format for posting order, is that right or are you doing high to low I thought \u2013 I just want to clarify that? Grayson Hall : Chronological. Sameer Gokhale : Okay. Grayson Hall : And to the extent possible, I think chronological in the purest sense is not possible, but chronological to the degree the transactions allow us to do that. Sameer Gokhale : Yes \u2013 no, I understand. There seems to be a lot of complexity and lack of clarity around exactly what the final rules will be. But just to kind of further flesh that out, I was curious as to your adoption of the chronological order, because in talking to other banks, it seems like many of them have not yet done anything. They are waiting for the final rules to come out. And if and when the final \u2013 when the final rules come out, if they are different from what you kind of implemented, then would you need to change that again, so I am just trying to get a sense for the thought process there and kind of going ahead with the chronological process \u2013 the chronological order? Grayson Hall : Yes. Sameer I mean as we think through it, we are absolutely focused on trying to serve our customers in the way that we believe to be appropriate, and we think there is a growing perception on the part of customers that some type of chronological based posting is a more appropriate way to go. We are in close communication with the regulatory authorities about faults on process, faults on posting and we appreciate that that may change on us. We believe we are building the process that we are almost all of our transactions will be time order posted. That being said, because of the complexity of posting, you never quite get the perfection. But we believe this is the right thing to do, and so we are pressing ahead with it. As David said, right now our project plans would have us completing that this year. And so we are on schedule to do that. And if changes occur in subsequent quarters, we will make changes as they are deemed necessary and appropriate. But I think we waited long enough and we feel like that it\u2019s the right time from a purely from a customer standpoint that we need to do this. It\u2019s got \u2013 obviously any change can have a mixed reaction on the part of the customers and we just want to be careful that our customers \u2013 we communicate well and we are transparent and we do this not only to do the right thing, but do it the right way and so we are trying to do that. Sameer Gokhale : Okay. And then just a quick one if I may, I know you did talk about the home equity loans growing for the first time in a long time, I don\u2019t know if you had mentioned what the reason for that is and if you could give us a sense for what those proceeds are used \u2013 being used for, are they being used up to pay down consumer credit cards or something else, that would be helpful? Thank you. Grayson Hall : Well, I mean \u2013 we have been \u2013 we a few years ago we were predominantly an equity line of credit, is the product that we went to market with. I think that as you saw quite a while back, we introduced amortizing home equity loan that has proved very attractive to our customer base. What we have seen is in this quarter when you consolidate the net of home equity lines and home equity loans, you are seeing customers did \u2013 you are seeing that pivot point where on that basis for the first time in 6 years, we have started to grow that portfolio, that\u2019s the combination of the runoff of the equity line portfolio has slowed, and the increase in the home equity loan has increased substantially to accommodate that. I would say anecdotally, most of the home equity loans we are making are for sort of a smaller dollar home refinance. Also home repairs and to a less degree and last on that list would be debt consolidation. Strong FICO score probably averaging close to 7, 7.78, LTV around 60%, so good product going on and I think serving our customers well. Sameer Gokhale : That\u2019s great. Thanks Grayson. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just had one follow-up question on credit. Barb, it looks like the way I am reading the charge-off breakdown, in C&I this quarter and in owner occupied CRE last quarter, the single basis point loss rate implies to me that there could be recoveries in those two categories. And I guess, the question here as we think about provisioning and reserving going forward, is it 23 basis points to 28 basis points charge-off range that we saw in the past two quarters sustainable or given potentially outsized recoveries, should we look to the range prior to those two quarters of between 35 basis points to 40 basis points? Barb Godin : Yes. Erika, recoveries actually do play a role in what we saw this past quarter, but it also played a role in prior quarters. The one thing I would caution on it, I think recoveries is, a lot of the loans that we charged off those are recoveries that we have already received as our charge-offs have come down and this was an opportunity for recoveries going forward. The 23 points of loss that we are pretty pleased about this quarter is great, but we do believe again that that\u2019s probably close to the bottom of where we are going to be. We might get another point to two out of it. But again, we will probably move somewhere between that 25 basis points to 35 basis point range as we think forward. Erika Najarian : And as my \u2013 the second question to that is, how long do you think from a credit standpoint, we could stay in that 25 basis points to 35 basis point range and I guess a better way to ask that is, do you see anything near-term that could move you outside of that band? Barb Godin : Yes. The only thing I could see near-term at all is something that we can\u2019t see. What \u2013 from everything that we see that\u2019s in front of us, we feel comfortable that we will stay in that band. But again, you never know if you have some other factors that happens in the economy that will create an issue for us, and we will disclose at that time. Erika Najarian : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, Grayson. I was wondering if I guess a question on expenses in an absolute sense. So David, you talked about having a little room in some areas to improve, but then you talked about also the kind of normalization of that deposit administrative line, so what are the puts and takes about \u2013 in future expense growth and how much of that kind of continued investment burden, do you still bear from here? David Turner : Well, I wouldn\u2019t categorize investment as a burden. Some of that is good. Investments we are making to grow our revenue generators is a good expense. We will do that all day long and expect a return for those type of investments. I will tell you, though as we think about managing our expense base, again we got to look at salaries and benefits. I can see furniture and fixtures in our outside services, so those four categories. And in that, we can tighten up a little bit in terms of some of the investments we have had to make over time to deal with regulatory environment that we are facing in this banking industry things that are related to risk management, capital planning and those kinds of things that in compliance and audit. All those over time will rationalize. And you should see some opportunities for us there. Also, as you know we have done branch consolidations in the past. That\u2019s brought down salaries and benefits. It\u2019s brought down furniture and fixtures. It\u2019s brought down occupancy expense. And while we don\u2019t have any current plans for branch consolidations, we are continuing to look at our branch footprint as part of our retail network strategy to ensure that channel is optimized that we will make investments where appropriate and we\u2019ll tighten up other areas that \u2013 other branches where the revenue generation isn\u2019t strong enough for us. And then lastly, I will tell you we have a number of Six Sigma initiatives underway in our company. Firstly, every department has an obligation to look at how they can become more efficient. We haven\u2019t had a named expense initiative as you know, but internally, we have an intense focus on expense management. And so there is not an expense that is off the radar screen, but the areas we will move the meter of those four, five areas I mentioned. Ken Usdin : And I \u2013 sorry, go ahead, Grayson. Grayson Hall : No, I just add to what David said, I think we are absolutely committed to rigorous expense management across the company. You can never be as good as you want to be in that regard. We continue to challenge ourselves internally that are we being good expense managers? In this environment, it\u2019s a critical skill. But we also are more than willing to make prudent investments that allow us to grow prudently. And so we will continue to do that. We think those have been smart decisions. They certainly are paying off. And to David\u2019s point, we will do that every day. And we have done that in terms of recruiting new bankers on to our team making investments in our current team to allow us to grow more appropriately, but prudently. And so as part of \u2013 if you look at, if you backup and look at our efficiency ratio and you look at it both expense and revenue side, we have done much better on the expense side than we have on the revenue side. And we are trying to take a very balanced approach to expense management, a thoughtful approach that gets us where we want to be. And to David\u2019s point, we are trying to make incremental improvement every quarter to get down to that lower 60% efficiency ratio, but it\u2019s going to require work on both sides of that formula. Ken Usdin : Yes, I understood. And just as a quick follow-up on that, though working on it and is it the type of stuff that I know you don\u2019t have a program or a number, but as you think about the things you can work on, is it more just about monitoring the rate of growth or do you think you would have the ability to actually at some point get the expense base back down? Grayson Hall : Well, let me \u2013 it\u2019s not to make it more complicated than it is, we clearly have been making investments in risk management and we have been making investments in bankers and growth opportunities that we see. We tried to self fund a great deal of that expense and have process improvement in a number of our back offices. We have tried to do that process improvement in a lot of our support offices such as legal and in vendor management, but we also have tried to rationalize our channels. And in particular, the branch channel has been, we think, pretty aggressive in rationalizing channels and trying to make them as efficient as we can without reducing our effectiveness for the customer. And so it \u2013 while we don\u2019t have a branded program, rest assured, we got lots of internal programs. David Turner : Yes. And Ken, we were down in expenses four years in a row. We didn\u2019t commit to having expenses in \u201815 lower than \u201814, because we knew we want to make investments in the revenue generators and some are still coming on board, so that generated the revenue. We think that\u2019s the right kind of spend for us. Can we get down to the expense level that we had in \u201814 at some point? It just depends on the investments we make going forward. I think the first order of business is to watch the spend, so that the rate of growth is the most appropriate rate of growth and then we can look at how efficient can we get over time with the use of things like Six Sigma and so forth. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. How are you? Grayson Hall : Well. Geoffrey Elliott : Question on the energy portfolio, I was interested to see that was kind of down a couple of percent over the quarter, which is lower than the pace of decline that we have seen at some of the other banks. So, I am curious is that a deliberate strategy on your part? Are you trying to pursue more of a stick with the customer keep providing credit strategy than you think some of the other banks might be or do you think that could just be differences in structural portfolios? John Turner : Geoffrey, this is John Turner. First of all, we say we are committed to sticking with our customers on where that makes sense. And I think as you think about what we are doing today, we are approaching our evaluation business on an ongoing basis with a healthy skepticism, but staying very close to our customers so that we understand what\u2019s going on their businesses. When you look at the reduction in commitments, primarily occurred in the E&P space, where as a result of borrowing base re-determinations, we reduced commitments by a little over $320 million, or on average, about 16%. We also had a number of our customers access the capital markets. And in fact, over the last seven months, I guess they have raised over $7 billion in the capital markets that used those funds to both to add additional liquidity to potentially make investments, to reduce their leverage, and so that certainly had an impact as well. And we think our clients are doing all the right things. And so as a result, we have a \u2013 we are cautiously confident about the performance of the book. When I say doing the right things, our customers have reacted quickly to market conditions. They have reduced their expenses, reduced their CapEx. They are raising liquidity and reducing leverage where appropriate. And as a consequence, I think we will continue to see some reduction in the business until the market turns and reinvestment occurs. Grayson Hall : And John, if you would speak for a minute about customer selectivity and limited number of things in our book? John Turner : Yes, I think just another aspect of the way we think about the risk in the book is as I said this before, we have really a small number of larger names, we think colossal activity has been one of the hallmarks of our energy book. These are customers that we have known for a long time. Most of them, at least of any size, are very recognizable in the industry. Management teams are very experienced. As I mentioned, good access to capital markets and liquidity and we think that they are doing all the right things. We have spent a lot of time internally reviewing the portfolio. I mentioned that we have a quarterly review process for our oilfield services book. We have now looked at internally over 91% of our oilfield services exposure within the last four months. We also have done borrowing base re-determinations on all, but one of our E&P relationship, so 98% plus or minus, of that book. And then our energy portfolio has been subject to a number of external reviews, including the SNC exam, where we think 67% of our total energy book was reviewed as part of the SNC exam. That\u2019s about 89% of the E&P portfolio and over 55% \u2013 or about 55% of oilfield services. So, a lot of eyes on our energy portfolio and we think a lot of transparency given the fact that there are smaller number of larger exposures, which is a good thing. On the downside, there is some single name risk associated with deterioration. But all-in-all, I think we feel like we have a pretty good handle on the exposure in the energy portfolio. Geoffrey Elliott : And to follow-up, the increase in the right exposure, what happened there over the quarter? Grayson Hall : We had some reclassifications as we can\u2019t continue to look for indirect exposures that are in some way impacted by the energy business. So as an example, we pulled in some of our investor real estate portfolio, where we have income-producing properties that are leased to third parties which happen to be in the energy space. And so as we capture that as an indirect exposure, that had an impact on outstandings, as example. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo. Grayson Hall : Matt good morning. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. David maybe a question for you, you mentioned branch reduction. And obviously that\u2019s been a positive story for you, all down about 3% year-over-year with them, somewhat more positive momentum in the last couple of quarters, but also looking at the transaction services only line, that\u2019s been pretty stable, I guess I am curious how you all are thinking about the product delivery capability over the next couple of years as you think about rationalizing branches, full service branches, should we begin to see the full service branches continue to come down, but at the same time the transaction services presumably smaller, less costly branches, rise? Grayson Hall : Well, you asked the question to David, but if you don\u2019t mind, I will answer it. I think it is we have said about a number of our businesses around the company, we tend to be very data driven. And we think it\u2019s important to make sure we understand the data and what\u2019s going on in all of our channels. And branches, in particular, we are doing a lot from an experimentation and an innovation perspective with new branch formats, less people, more technology. We also are experimenting with a number of innovative designs around drive-throughs and our capabilities of our ATMs and all sat locations. All are being said, we still \u2013 when you look at the markets we operate in and the customers that we serve, and we serve almost 4 million customers across 16 states, they all have different needs. And when you look at our customer base, still 59% of our customers will visit one of our branches in the next 30 days. So we still have a lot of customer traffic. In fact, we got a lot of branches that are operating at over capacity levels. And so we\u2019ve introduced a number of digital capabilities. Deposit \u2013 smartphone deposit capture, remote deposit capture for our small business and corporate customers. We tried to use innovation to try to take more transactions out of our branches that allows us to be more efficient, but also dedicate more resource to sales and service. And so we have been introducing technology into our ATMs. Roughly 75% of our ATMs today have the ability to take a deposit through image technology. If you look at how efficient we have got, almost 21% of the deposits are company \u2013 are coming through the digital channel as opposed to coming through one of our branch offices. So making good progress, but we are letting the data drive the number. So when we see a bench that is \u2013 that transaction volumes and customer accounts in a particular branch is \u2013 drives that decision so that we don\u2019t do that anecdotally, but we do it with a lot of data and data analytics. And so we will continue to do that. I do think customers are showing a preference for additional channels, but it varies per market. And a lot of our markets are still very, very branch dependent and so we pay attention to that. Matt Burnell : Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. And David, maybe I can direct this one to you, specifically on the earning assets, you saw about an $860 million decline, 29% decline in other interest earning assets which I presume is mostly cash at the Fed, how does that number trend in your current outlook for margin through the rest of the year? David Turner : Yes. You are exactly right, so we put the excess cash to work, so that pushed in terms of the loan growth. We should see some growth in earning assets that will come with deposit growth picking up. And now the question is where will that be deployed in the securities book, cash at the Fed or in loan growth and we feel good about our loan growth, gave you a little bit of good guidance in terms of what we thought we will do, skewing towards the upper end of our previously announced range. So we expect that to pick up slightly. Matt Burnell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Grayson Hall : Good morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. Thank you. A couple of questions, one could you guys just go over the Shared National Credit outstandings, I didn\u2019t hear it clearly and I think the transcript may have gotten a number of incorrect\u2026? Grayson Hall : Barb, could you speak to that. Barb Godin : Yes, I will speak to it. In fact, it\u2019s $18 billion roughly in outstandings that we have for the Shared National Credit. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And because the transcript I think said 50 is \u2013 I assume the transcript is incorrect then. Barb Godin : You\u2019re correct. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Coming back to your loan portfolio, at one point you guys were de-risking the portfolio by allowing the commercial real estate balances to come down. And I believe that ended some time ago, but there is still shrinking. And maybe can you give us some color what\u2019s going on in the commercial real estate investor as well as on owner-occupied commercial estate mortgage portfolios? John Turner : Yes. This is John Turner. First let me start with owner-occupied real estate. We are continuing to see that book run off a bit. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much reflective of the fact that we are just not seeing middle market sort of lower end to middle market in our business banking, small business customers invest in expanding their businesses. So the volume of activity that we see is down. That portfolio amortizes every month and so we are continuing to see some run off, although the run off is slowing a bit and we expect that to trend to actually turn in the future. As it relates to investor real estate, we did de-risk the book. We have remade our business model, built it around professional real estate bankers working closely with real estate developers, again real focused on client selectivity. It\u2019s a business we want to grow, but it\u2019s heavily construction-oriented today, and we would like to see a shift more to have a better balance between construction and term lending. We are very committed to managing that book in a very disciplined and thoughtful way, applying our concentration limit methodology to make sure that we don\u2019t have too much exposure to any product type or any particular market, diversity is really important to us as we think about managing that business going forward. So I think you can expect to see it grow sort of as the economy grows, would be our plan, kind of the 2% to 4% range, but not much faster than that as we seek to manage that risk prudently and shift again the mix from construction to more term... Gerard Cassidy : And then just as a follow-up, Grayson you gave us some good color on the branches and your digital channel and the activity you are getting through the digital channel. And it\u2019s certainly a topic of debate in the industry today about the retail branch model. I \u2013 with your 1,500 or so branches can you guys give us some color on the profitability, how many of those are meeting your return on equity or internal rate of return hurdles, how many are not profitable, so give us a flavor? Grayson Hall : Yes. We would certainly \u2013 we calculate that data. We calculate that data on a real frequent basis. And we got different hurdles that we try to monitor to make sure each of our offices are meeting our hurdles. And where we are at today is roughly 98%, 99% of our branch offices are providing a positive direct contribution to our earnings. That being said, do they all hurdle over internal rate of return requirements for branches are we have to look at each individual branch and see whether that branch is predominantly servicing transactions or are they going accounts, are they growing balances both deposits and loans. Then we take all that into consideration. And we take into consideration the markets they operate in before we make that consolidation decision. Quite frankly, we are seeing tremendous growth in digital channels, but the growth in digital channels is faster than the reduction of activity in our branches. A lot of digital activity is new activity. It\u2019s additional activity. But we are seeing patterns in our branches change and we make movements, take decisions based off those behavioral changes. But I will go back to my earlier comment, when it comes to the branch, our decision can\u2019t be anecdotal. It has to be based off the absolute numerics of that branch and it has to be in the best interest of the community that we operate in. Our engagement in our communities and our commitment to the communities we operate in is very, very important to us and so all of that has to be considered when we look at branches. David Turner : Gerard, I\u2019ll add to that. One thing we have consolidated little over 20% of our branch count since the crisis. We stay focused on it. And one of the things we need to \u2013 we have to think through is even those that don\u2019t give us the return we would like is we have to look at what the next alternative is if we don\u2019t have that branch. Because anytime we consolidate a branch, we lose revenue. Now, the goal is to lose more expense from the revenue that we just lost and that\u2019s why you have seen the consolidation to be in a very measured pace. We will continue to look at that. And while we don\u2019t have any identified as of right now, you should expect us to continue to rationalize our whole retail footprint over time. Grayson Hall : But I think an important point to make is that today we are seeing a higher level of sales growth in our physical points of presence. In fact, our branches \u2013 our sales in the second quarter \u2013 new account sales in the second quarter is the highest we have seen in four years, so very good performance out of branches this quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Grayson and David, thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions. Firstly, Barb, on your Shared National Credits of $18 billion, how much are you the lead on? Barb Godin : We are the lead on \u2013 I don\u2019t have the dollars at my fingertips, but it is roughly 100 credits. Vivek Juneja : 100 credits. Barb Godin : Out of a book of approximately 1,300. Vivek Juneja : Okay, okay, great. And then secondly, maybe just for Grayson and David, let me turn back to the efficiency ratio question, when I look at your efficiency ratio calculation, I add back the deposit administrative fee refund that you got. Your core efficiency ratio is essentially flat with last quarter at roughly 65%, which is up almost 180 basis points from a year ago. And I know you are talking about it coming down into the low 60s. How much of that decline given that there is a lot of expense pressure, which you have touched on an investment that you are doing. So, how much of the decline that you are expecting are you factoring in from Fed rate hike benefit? I mean, going from 65 to low 60s, David or Grayson, how much do you expect to come from there? David Turner : Yes, we don\u2019t have it broken out in terms of just related to the rate hike. What I will tell you is that the main driver of our efficiency ratio is growing our revenue appropriately. We do have the expense measures that we are looking at in that revenue growth is expecting those investments that we have made thus far to continue to generate the revenue growth and we are seeing that. We saw that this quarter with 7% NIR growth, but we have people we hired just an example our financial consultants were up to 200. We\u2019ve just got our 200th one, I think this week, but it takes time for those new folks to generate the revenue that we expect. It\u2019s about eight or nine months. So, we carry the expense load until the revenue comes. And so part of our getting into that lower 60s is rate, part of it is continued execution from the people that are here. And then from the expense side, as I mentioned earlier in the call, continuing to look at the support groups, whether it be again finance, HR, risk management, credit teams, all that infrastructure that we look at we continue to work to rationalize that to use technology to help us deliver our products and services cheaper to our customer base. So, all of that has to work together to get our efficiency ratio down into the lower 60s. We really want to get to the higher 50s. That does take a rate hike to get where we are in a normal rate environment. So that will take some time to get there. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Dave. David Eads : Hello. Thanks for taking the call. Just I guess a couple of questions on the loan growth, maybe on indirect auto we have seen some talk about the CFPB and dealer markups on those loans. I am curious what you guys do when it comes to dealer discretion on pricing? And then I guess more broadly, what you think that those moves could mean for competition across the industry? David Turner : Well, we have seen obviously a change in some of our competitors in terms of dealer markups. Today, we give 200 basis points discretion, which is a little lower than the average peer. The average peer has been to 300. They lowered down to 250. So, we are a little lower than peers. We have seen some go to flats. The industry really is looking, along with the captives, which have just come into the fold for the CFPB to really give the \u2013 those of us that operate with the rules of the game are. And what I will tell you is we will adapt and overcome. We just want to know what they are. We will figure out how to make money in whatever environment it is. So, right now, I think there is a measured pace as to whether or not we go to flats or whether or not we go from 200 to 100 or some other basis. But I think that if you looked at our business, half of it only has 100 basis points of discretion in it. So, we are positioned well to adapt to whatever the rules are. We just need some finalization to come from the regulatory side. Grayson Hall : And I will just add to what David said. We have done a number of things strategically to try to position ourselves better for what David has outlined as an industry that\u2019s under change. And we are trying to measure that change, interpret that change. So, we have done some experimentation and some innovation around pricing. We have experimented with substantially reduced markups. We have experimented with something much lower than our standard. We have worked with our dealers and strategically we have reduced the number of dealers we do business with to make sure that we have got large dealer groups that we have got confidence in the way they run the risk management part of their business. And we will continue to make changes as the market changes. Today, though the commercial banks are only about a third of that marketplace and so commercial banks are responding to it, it\u2019s still been a good market for us, but been very selective in who we do business with and what kind of business we will place on the books. David Eads : Great. That\u2019s some good color. And then I think you guys broke out this other consumer indirect category this quarter. And I am just kind of curious, you talked about that being partnerships with primarily home improvement retailers, is that kind of going to have the characteristics of a home equity loan or a card loan and kind of what you are looking to do with that business? Grayson Hall : At its core, it\u2019s basically indirect lending through point of sale. And we have partnered with people who provide the front-end origination of those loans at retailers. And so we \u2013 it\u2019s just an alternative source. As you see, there is a lot of change in the consumer lending space, a lot of digital offerings in the market, but there is also a lot of offerings that are taking place at point of purchase, if you will, and home improvement is a big issue for a lot of our customers and what they want to get that financing when they walk into the home improvement store. And so we have partnered to try to capture some of that. And so we are trying to be innovative in consumer lending and this is just an example where we have had some good progress in that regard. David Eads : Great, thanks. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. I will now turn the floor back over for closing remarks. Grayson Hall : Well, listen, thank you for your questions. We very much appreciate your questions, appreciate your participation, your interest in Regions. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. M. List Underwood - Director of Investor Relations : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation in our call today. Our presenters are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are present and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call, and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking disclaimer that is located in the appendix section of the presentation. With that I'll turn it over to Grayson. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us for our call today. For the third quarter we reported earnings from continuing operations of $246 million or $0.19 per diluted share. These results reflect total adjusted revenue growth, despite an operating environment that remains challenging. In the third quarter we continued to deliver growth in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth. Our fundamentals are strong with growth in households, accounts, loans and deposits. In fact, one of the most important categories is checking accounts, which we've grown by more than 2% year-to-date. We remain focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our need-based approach to relationship banking. Total net interest income increased 2% from the second quarter, representing the highest quarterly increase in approximately two years. For the same period, total loans increased 1% on an ending basis and were up 2% on average basis, contributing to the increase in net interest income. Business lending had a good quarter, driven by real estate and corporate banking groups. Within real estate, REIT business growth was strong. The growth within corporate banking reflects the strength of our business model as local bankers collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans. In the third quarter all specialized industries experienced growth led by power, utilities, technology and defense, restaurant and healthcare. Consumer lending had another strong quarter reaching $30 billion in total outstandings on an ending basis with growth in every loan category. Our new point of sale initiative led this growth as consumers took advantage of the convenience of this product offering. Additionally, indirect vehicle lending continues to be strong supported by robust auto sales during the summer. Total noninterest revenue in the third quarter declined compared to a strong second quarter. The majority of the decline was attributable to a lower benefit from mortgage servicing rights and related hedges. Despite this decline, we have continued to experience good momentum in several areas, including capital markets and wealth management as our prior investments continue to produce results. Wealth management income was strong this quarter, up 13% over prior year. We remain focused on our strategy to grow wealth management by continuing to recruit, retain and develop talent required to meet the diverse needs of our clients. We will continue to look for insurance acquisitions and lift-outs, similar to our recent addition in Georgia. Clearly this operating environment continues to be challenging as we have continued to face lower interest rates for an extended period of time. Furthermore, we expect the pace of increases in interest rates to be slow and measured. Given this backdrop, it's essential that we take more aggressive action as it relates to expense management. We've instituted a number of initiatives and are carefully evaluating a number of other actions that we will provide more details at our Investor Day on November 19. Credit quality was relatively stable during the quarter, with some weakening in the energy portfolio. As expected there's been some downward migration risk ratings inside this portfolio. These shifts could continue if oil prices remain at current levels. Overall, we believe our energy customers are taking appropriate actions by reducing costs and making other infrastructure adjustments to create liquidity, preserve our capital, and reduce debt to mitigate vulnerabilities to this environment. As a result, we expect any future losses related to this portfolio to be manageable. We have remained focused on our strategic initiatives for 2015 and have made progress diversifying, growing total revenue by continuing to effectively deploy capital. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time and in the near term will rigorously seek operating efficiencies. With that, I'll now turn it over to David, who'll cover the details for the third quarter. David. David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the third quarter details and then wrap up with our expectations for the remainder of 2015. Loan balances totaled $81 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $914 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Year-to-date, loans have increased $3.8 billion or 5%. Business services achieved solid growth with balances totaling $51 billion at quarter end, an increase of 1%. Commercial and industrial loans grew $559 million or 2% and commitments also increased 2%. As previously mentioned, real estate corporate banking and all specialized lending areas experienced growth in the third quarter. Consumer lending had another strong quarter. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior quarter. Indirect vehicle lending increased 3% while production increased 8%. And other indirect lending, which focuses primarily on home improvement retailers, increased $107 million linked quarter or 28%. Year-to-date, loans in this new portfolio have increased $284 million and we plan to continue to grow this business into 2016. Mortgage loan balances increased $141 million, while production declined compared to a seasonally strong second quarter, total production remained healthy at $1.4 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 2% from the previous quarter and our penetration rate into our existing customer base now stands at 17%, up almost 200 basis points from the third quarter of last year. And finally, total home equity balances increased $48 million from the previous quarter as new production outpaced portfolio runoff in the third quarter. Let's take a look at deposits. Supported by our multi-channel platform, average deposit balances increased $66 million and totaled $97 billion at quarter end. Consumer and wealth deposits represented 75% of total deposits. Of note, our average account balance is smaller and is expected to be less volatile in a rising rate environment. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points, while total funding costs remained at 25 basis points. Now let's see how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $855 million, an increase of $16 million or 2% from the previous quarter. Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase. In an effort to mitigate impacts from a continued low rate environment, we executed hedges involving interest rate derivatives. These strategies benefited net interest income while only modestly reducing asset sensitivity. The net interest margin was primarily affected by pressure on asset yields and higher cash balances, resulting in a 3 basis point margin decline to 3.13%. Total noninterest income declined after a particularly strong second quarter, driven in part by lower mortgage revenue due to lower benefits from mortgage servicing rights and the related hedges. However, our investments in and commitment to diversifying and growing fee-based revenues yielded positive results in several areas. Total wealth management income increased 5% linked quarter, driven by insurance income and investment services fee income. Insurance income increased 15%, driven in part by the acquisition that Grayson previously mentioned. And investment services fee income grew 15% as our financial consultants continue to expand and deepen relationships, primarily through our Regions360 approach to needs-based selling. Capital markets income increased $2 million over the previous quarter, primarily related to a pickup in loan syndication income. This reflects our continued investment in people and products in order to grow and diversify revenue. Card and ATM fees increased 3% as a result of increased credit card usage as well as an increase in active credit cards. Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the third quarter were $895 million, an increase of $35 million on an adjusted basis. This included an increase of $31 million in deposit administrative fees. In the third quarter we incurred an expense of $23 million related to prior assessments. Also impacting the linked quarter variance were refunds that we received in the second quarter of $6 million from overpayments. We expect the future quarterly run rate for this expense item to be in the $22 million to $25 million range. Salaries and benefits were down 1% linked quarter. Additional head count related primarily to strategic investments drove an increase in base salaries; however, this was offset by reductions in performance-based incentives. Expenses related to occupancy increased linked quarter due to seasonal increases in utilities. And additionally, furniture and fixtures increased from the previous quarter due to investments in technology and back-office infrastructure which will improve efficiency over the long-term. This expense item is expected to increase modestly over the next few quarters, reflecting these investments. Outside services declined $2 million from the prior quarter, partially related to lower risk management and compliance cost. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 66.8% in the quarter; however, excluding the additional expenses related to deposit administrative fees, the resulting ratio was 65%. As Grayson previously noted, in this operating environment, we must do even more to improve our efficiencies and lower operating cost. To that end, we have recently instituted hiring restrictions and continue to rigorously review all discretionary expenditures. Additionally, we have allocated expense challenges and goals by business unit and we will provide more details on these additional steps when we meet with you for Investor Day next month. Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased and represented 30 basis points of average loans. Importantly, this increase does not reflect the broad deterioration in credit quality. Total business services criticized and classified loans increased $304 million, or 10% from the prior quarter. And nonaccrual loans increased 5%. These increases were driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans, primarily within the energy portfolio. As it relates to the energy portfolio, we remain in close contact with our energy customers. Rigorous credit servicing activities are ongoing and we have instituted heightened requirements for loan renewals. As previously stated, we anticipate additional migration into non-pass categories but expect any losses in this portfolio to be manageable. Based on what we know today, over the next 12 months to 18 months losses could range in the $30 million to $50 million range; however, we have adequate reserves to cover these losses. The provision for loan losses was $60 million, matching net charge-offs, and our allowance for loan losses was relatively stable at 1.38% at the end of the third quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, troubled debt restructured loans, or TDRs, declined 7%. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans, or coverage ratio, was 141%. And given where we are in the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices. Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $270 million, or 26.6 million shares of common stock, and declared dividends of $79 million. Under the Basel III provisions, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan and deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83% and regarding the liquidity coverage ratio Regions remains well-positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation deadline. Now, let me have a brief review of current expectations for the remainder of 2015. We expect total loan growth to be in the 4% to 6% range on a point-to-point basis and probably end up at the higher end of that range. Regarding deposits, we continue to expect full-year average deposit growth in the 1% to 2% range. With respect to the margin, we expect performance through year end to be marginally better than the full year guidance communicated in early 2015, which call for a decline of 10 basis points to 12 basis points, if rates remain persistently low. However, even if rates remain low, net interest income is expected to grow moderately. Finally, we expect to continue to benefit from revenue initiatives and we will take steps to prudently manage our expenses. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I'll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. M. List Underwood - Director of Investor Relations : Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. I appreciate your cooperation. Now let's open up the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question, here. First, one of the things about the energy portfolio and the reserves. I know you guys don't tend to disclose, maybe specific reserves related to the energy portfolio, but did you take any incremental provision related to that $30 million to $50 million in potential losses that you could see? Or was that, as you said, just kind of matching the net charge-offs you had in the quarter? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen, thank you, that's a good question. And I'll ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer to make a few comments in that regard. And then John Turner, Head of Corporate Banking, to follow that up. Barb? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Thanks very much, Grayson. Yes, we actually did take some incremental reserves this quarter on the energy portfolio. And we currently stand at around 4.7% of that portfolio being reserved. So, we are well reserved given where we feel the losses will be in the next 12 months to 18 months. John M. Turner, Jr. - Senior Executive Vice President, Head-Corporate Banking Group : And I would just add we provided some additional detail, particularly on the Oil Field Services sector, in our release. I think what you'll see is that we have, as we said before, a smaller number of customers that comprise our portfolio. We believe that we've been very prudent in the selection of those clients, stay very close to them. We think they're doing all the right things to react to the crisis that they have faced, the declining oil prices. And so we remain cautiously optimistic about the performance of our book. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay, thanks, I appreciate that. And, yeah, definitely I appreciate the additional color there in the slide deck. And then, just as a follow-up as it relates to capital deployment. Obviously the share buyback was a little bit; it seemed accelerated, in the quarter. I'm assuming just taking advantage of the lower share prices. Is that something that you guys can continue to do in this current quarter as the share remains maybe lower than it should be, in my view? And how much flexibility do you have there? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : This is David. So we have, obviously, a capital plan that was not objected to by regulatory supervisors for which we are executing against. We were able to move up a small portion of that into a different quarter, but in order to have any meaningful change in our total buyback we would have to go through a submission to our regulatory supervisors for future \u2013 any increases in the buyback over our CCAR request. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. So the $875 million will remain the same but you could pull that forward kind of like we saw here in the current quarter? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : That's what \u2013 we did pull a piece of that forward this past quarter, but we can't change the $875 million. Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Perfect. Thank you guys so much. I appreciate the color. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ken, good morning. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, Grayson. Hey, just a quick question just on the outlook for net interest income. David, your comments about less bad than the prior guidance earlier in the year was kind of lost in sequential so just wondering can you help us understand; do we still see kind of the core compression of the NIM from here on an ex-rates basis? And what other drivers do you have to help support that further? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think so we will still have a couple basis points of compression expected for the quarter. We really are speaking more to NII. We believe that can continue to grow, though. But obviously you're continuing to see the impact, partially higher cash balances for us, our driver, and then this low rate environment grinding down, but will put in a couple of basis point pressure from here to the end of the year. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : And underneath that it looked like the loan yields have started to flatten out. Was that just finally getting past the natural rollover or was there any incremental help from swaps or hedging activity that helped as well? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : It's a little bit of both. So you're seeing low rates work through to some degree, but you have to have help from some of the derivatives that we put on as well. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Marty. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Morning. David, I had two questions for you. One is, looking at the investment process that you've been in, that kind of forced your expenses to grow faster than your revenues over the last year. Do you anticipate that you're kind of getting to the inflection point where the return on investments begin to flip that around and you can start to create that operating leverage that you're talking to in your outlook? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : That's a great question, Marty. So I would tell you we've made investments in a lot of areas to execute our strategy which is to diversify our revenue stream into some NIR sources. In some cases we have further investments to make and in others we're just about finished. So an example of that would be our financial consultants that we have and wealth management. We had a goal to hire about 225 of those through September 30. We have about 219, so we've got a handful more to go in the fourth quarter and we'll be done. And so what you'll start seeing is the payoff of these investments will start becoming even stronger relative to the investments or the expense that we had earlier. And so it just depends on which investment we're talking about. Our goal is to grow our income, diversify our revenue stream and to have better returns on capital over time, which is why we've needed to make those investments early on. And they're starting to pay off for us. They are performing exactly like we expected. As a matter of fact, in some cases they're actually ahead of schedule. So you've seen expense go up and we've talked about making the investments. We still believe it's been the right thing for us to do and you'll see the benefit as we get into 2016 and beyond. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But Marty, to add to that, we obviously have made what we think are very prudent investments and the results we've seen from those investments have been very positive and we continue to see opportunities for that. That being said, given the current rate environment and our rate forecast for what we believe the next few quarters hold, we've had become much more rigorous on expense management. We are trying to self-fund a lot of our investments to make sure that as David said, over time we can generate positive operating leverage as a company. So you will see us be more rigorous around expense management over the next few quarters. We just think given the rate environment that it's prudent to do that. That being said, we really are trying to create long-term franchise value while being sensitive to quarter-to-quarter earnings pressure. But we need to make sure that we're thoughtful about how we manage expenses and to make sure that we continue to build franchise value over time. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. And then, David, this won't be a surprise, so my next question, but you started to step out with hedging and neutralizing some of your asset sensitivity position. You kind of said net it really didn't affect your pickup when rates go up. Is that enough? You're still letting cash balances build. Shouldn't you start thinking about neutralizing that balance sheet over, let's say, the next 12 months, at least, more aggressively? And I know you're smiling there listening me to ask that same question I've asked several times before, but just wanted to ask you that again. David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : So Marty, we continue to challenge ourselves on the positioning of the balance sheet. We have been asset-sensitive for an extended period of time. We believe staying asset-sensitive is the right thing for us as we seek to extract the value out of our competitive advantage, which is our deposit base, our granular, sticky, consumer-oriented deposit base. And to neutralize rate sensitivity in this environment, we think, is the wrong thing to do. We did put on some hedges to protect ourselves, primarily, on a prolonged low rate or declining rate environment, but we didn't want to take too much sensitivity off. So we're still up instantaneous 100 basis points, we're still at about $155 million of NII impact, down from about $165 million. So, it was a slight change down. But we believe maintaining that sensitivity is the right thing for Regions, given the construct of our deposit franchise and that side of the balance sheet. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Couple of questions. One, Barb, I just wanted to make sure \u2013 you indicated that, regarding the energy, you feel like you've done the reserving you need to do here today. And could you just give us a sense of, that's at current oil price or the forwards on oil and the kind of timeframe that your price outlook persists? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Yeah. When we go through our process, including sizing up what we think the losses might be, et cetera, we go through looking at a number of models, but we also do an account-by-account bottoms-up review. We do that on a monthly basis, staying close to our customers, close to their balance sheets, et cetera. And when we look at the price of oil, we look at the spot price; we also look at the futures price as well. So all of that is incorporated into our thought process as to how we determine what the appropriate level of allowance was. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And what kind of discount do you give to spot and futures? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Well, again, we go through the standard. We start off with the number of barrels of oil that our engineers feel are in the basins, we apply our price deck to it \u2013 our current price deck base is $46, stressed $36.80, we discount that by the PD9. So discount it by 9%. Then we risk adjust all of that, again, one more time. We do that at approximately a 10% level, and then we do a borrowing base, the borrowing base is about 65% of all of that. So, long story short, is you'll end up with 53% of what's in the ground is what we'll lend against. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And do you think that there's going to be much in the way of a reduction in supply here, based on all of that and what you and others are doing with regard to these redeterminations or do you think supply kind of kicks along as is? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Well, I know with the borrowing base redeterminations we believe that we'll probably reduce another 15% to 20%, which is roughly what we did in the prior quarter as well. And we do see a lot of supply that's still out there. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just separately on the outlook for operating leverage, what I'm hearing is with the hiring restrictions and we'll see the benefits of the hiring that you've done over the last 12 months to 18 months come through, that we should look for operating leverage to improve as we go through the next two, three, four quarters. Is that a fair assessment? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : That's right. We wanted to continue, as Grayson mentioned, to make investments to grow revenue and we're going to self-fund those. So we're going to look at all areas of our company to control our expenses with the goal of generating positive operating leverage. It just takes time to work through. I think the question came earlier in terms of the investments; it takes time to generate the revenue that pays for the investment we made. But we are on track and we think you'll see that improvement coming through in 2016. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then in the past you've talked a little bit about the insurance growth from lift-outs. I know it's a modest effort relative to the size of the overall company, but would that continue in this outlook for slowing down hiring or putting a freeze on hiring? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : No... O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead, David. David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : We've continued to expect to make investments, as we mentioned. So, those are not included into the hiring numbers we've talked about, the freeze, as you mentioned, the restrictions. So you should see us continuing to look for opportunities to grow that insurance business. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. I know it's threading the needle between the words, just wanted to make sure where it starts and stops with regard to insurance, so I appreciate that. Thanks. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : As I said earlier, we recognize in this environment that the most prudent thing for us to do is to be much more rigorous, much more disciplined in managing expenses. That being said, we have to do that in a thoughtful way that doesn't degrade franchise value, that actually affords us the opportunity to continue to increase franchise value. And where there are opportunities, such as the insurance lift-outs, that provide us a situation that we believe that gives us economic benefit in a relatively short period of time, we're still going to seize those opportunities. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, David. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Maybe following up on energy just quickly \u2013 great color you've given so far. Just curious, particularly on the Oil Field Services side, if you can give any color on how you guys think about loss frequency and severity in that book. Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Yeah, this is Barb Godin again. You know, Oil Field Services in total is about $1.2 billion. 24% of that book is close to the well head. But what you need to know about that book is 66 customers make up 98% of that book. So we're very close to them. As I look at that overall book, what the largest piece of that book is is marine and we have just under $500 million, $494 million in marine, but 23 obligors. So, again, not very granular. But 70% of what we do in marine is deep water marine. So only 30% is on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. So, again, looking at that book we feel pretty good about the marine piece of that book. Quite frankly, all of the other pieces are quite manageable. The one that I would worry about the most would be the fluid piece and we have eight obligors in fluid and we have $99 million in outstandings for fluid. So, again, we're paying them a lot of love and attention these days. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for that. And then kind of on the loan growth side, obviously another quarter where almost everything is looking good, the main exception there being a continued runoff in the unoccupied commercial real estate portfolio. Are you any closer to kind of knowing when we might get an inflection point in that portfolio? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's a great question, and it's one we challenge ourselves with frequently. As David had said earlier, one of our primary goals is to try to not only grow revenue but to diversify our revenue streams. And if you look at what's different this quarter versus last quarter, certainly versus a quarter a year ago, we've really gotten greater diversity and gotten greater growth more broadly across the different lending segments. And as you pointed out, the one segment that we did not get growth in, have not hit an inflection point on, has been in owner-occupied real estate, which has predominantly been our small to medium size businesses that we provide banking product to. And in that small business community we have seen this year an improvement in production. What we've not seen is enough production to offset the normal amortization of that portfolio. And it's predominantly an amortizing portfolio. There's some line usage in that group, but mostly it's amortizing. We continue to look for that inflection point. We don't think it's too far down the road. But it's \u2013 that one product segment has been the one that we've been most challenged to reach that inflection point on. But good production numbers and I think the confidence of that segment is improving. But that small business sector has been sort of the last to recover from a confidence perspective. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's been a great deposit sector, though. We really have been growing deposits in that group. So, we're encouraged, but still not at that inflection point yet. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Paul. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yes. Thank you very much. Guys, I do want to commend you on the energy side. I do like it. I just had a question about your \u2013 how do you define indirect exposure and in that sense I get a lot of people \u2013 feedback I get from clients is, I'm not really worried about the direct exposure, I'm worried about the indirect exposure, i.e., small businesses in these communities, that are mainly oil-driven. Are you seeing any real deterioration in any of these communities, I guess, in the Gulf or where you do business? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll start and then I'll let Barb Godin speak just a second on that. We've really tried to take a broad view of what the implications of the drop in the commodity prices and the energy sector have been. And I think that some segments of that energy portfolio are fairly easy to define. When you get down to the indirect piece, there's some subjectivity and objectivity that's required to define those. And I would tell you that we've seen in certain cases some softness in some of those indirect segments. Overall, in some of our markets we operate in, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Houston, there's a lot of activities that's offsetting the softness in this activity from a community perspective, but some individual companies absolutely you see, do see some softness. Barb? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Yes, thank you, Grayson. We would define indirect as those types of companies, as an example transportation, that majority of their business is done to support something going on in the energy sector. So we capture all of that, that's incremental almost $500 million that we talk about. Relative to the other contagion effects that we would look at i.e., consumer, small business, commercial real estate, et cetera, we look at all that. Consumer side is a positive, it's a net positive, they're enjoying the low gas prices, it's helping them a lot, we're seeing that pickup, as an example, in our restaurant business that we have a specialty in. We're seeing better results there. Relative to some of the other areas as we think about Texas, the only area of any heightened attention is the Houston market, the office sector. We're looking at that. It's still doing well but we're keeping an eye on that. And New Orleans, of course has suffered a little bit from softening demand, as well. And that is pushing their vacancy rates up. Overall retail and all of those sectors have done well, a lot of the Gulf of Mexico and Houston as well. But we don't want to be a Pollyanna. We absolutely want to keep our heads up and keep attuned to making sure that if we do see some softness that we react quickly. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And as a follow-up, have you seen \u2013 have you got any feedback from the Fed with rates staying low on any guidance on your capital management? Or is your capital management good to go for the year until the next CCAR? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think \u2013 so we can't discuss anything with our regulatory supervisors. But suffice it to say that all capital planning that we have built into this year's expectations have been via the non-objection we received in our CCAR. So, if we wanted to do something outside of that, it would require some form of off-cycle request to our regulatory supervisors. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay, guys, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, John. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Morning. Just a question regarding the loss range of $30 million to $50 million on energy that you put out there. Can you give us a little bit of color on how you arrived at that? Did you look at the past cycles and what basis do you have behind the numbers on the calc? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : John, this is Barb Godin again. Again, we use both quantitative as well as qualitative. The quantitative being, yes, we look at models that we run. It includes historical information as well as current information of what we think will happen in the future. But, again, we supplant a lot of that with an ongoing monthly looking at every file, every customer, looking at what their balance sheets look like, looking at what their cash flows look like. So that, as we talk about our estimate of losses, we talk about \u2013 I can't talk about through the cycle, I don't know when the cycle will end, we use the 12 month to 18 month horizon to say we have pretty good visibility for that period of time. So, again, pretty comfortable with the number we put out there. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Now, Barb, is that 12 months to 18 months from now or for the cycle? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Yes. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. So now, do you have any way of identifying what that implies in terms of the accum loss assumption that you're now incorporating? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : No, I wouldn't go that far. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. All right. And then separately, David, just on the interest rate side, on the swaps. I'm not sure if you've disclosed, but did you indicate how much in swaps you added? And then also, can you give us just your thinking in terms of the willingness to add incremental swaps here or is this it? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, so we will be disclosing our swaps in the Q. We put about $3 billion of received fixed swaps. They're a little longer dated. We had some short-term that we took off, so we were up about $1 billion net on notional. John, as we think about interest rate risk positioning, it kind of gets back to Marty's question. We challenge ourselves every day on where we need to have this. We think taking that sensitivity away and foregoing that nice lift and nice benefit we think we'll get when rates rise would be the wrong long-term answer for our shareholders. So we'll pay the freight today for the benefit that we'll get tomorrow and we'll manage our profitability the way we've done. So we've put some incremental swaps on. We don't have any current plans to execute further swaps, but if conditions change, then we could change our mind as well. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. And if I could just ask one more. You may punt me to your Investor Day for the answer for this one, but I know you've been investing in a lot of your fee-based businesses that tend to be higher efficiency ratio businesses like wealth management and cap markets, but less capital-intensive and accordingly higher ROE. So can you give us just a \u2013 how do you think about that, how it could all come out in the wash in terms of the ultimate benefit to your ROE from these investments? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, that's a very good question. We challenge ourselves on that. You've nailed exactly the math there. We have to look at all of our businesses working together and the synergistic effect they can have on our total business and the diversification and how we might react in a stressed environment versus a normal environment. All those come into play as we think about the investments we want to make in businesses. We well understand that the investments in some of these businesses are less efficient. That's part of where our efficiency ratio is today, but they take a very little amount of capital, as well, so the return on capital is pretty strong. And they have a tendency to be annuity-based so that you can count on them year in and year out, so that's worth something. You will see \u2013 so I'll half punt to Investor Day, you'll see how all this comes together in terms of our outlook over the next three-year period with the investments that we have made and plan to make. And how we're going to self-fund these investments, as Grayson mentioned, from an expense standpoint so that we can improve our bottom line over time, so that we can become more efficient over time as well. So that we can \u2013 our business model can address whatever interest rate environment might be out there, we're going to put together a plan that shows you how we win in all those scenarios. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : All right. Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Erika. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just a follow-up question on the previous question on efficiency. If I take your adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% and I put together everything that you've said so far. So modest NII growth even if rates stay low because loan growth has been solid. You know, fee income starting to benefit from some of the investments that you've made, but naturally a more higher efficiency ratio business in terms of wealth management, capital markets and self-funding some of the investments, I guess over the next 12 months how much improvement can you generate on that 65% assuming no increase in rates from the expense side? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah. Well, let me talk about it in terms of all of our businesses coming together and this will be a discussion we'll have at Investor Day but, as you know, we've sought to be in the lower 60%s. We believe we can get there based on all the things we've talked to you about this morning. We'll get more granular on how if you'll come to Investor Day. But, our long-term goal with rates increasing was still in those higher 50%s that we've talked about previously. But we're building the business model and if we don't get the rate increase, how do we continue to improve bottom line, how do we continue to become more efficient, that is, get below 65 and trend towards the lower 60%s without rates increasing? So, we believe we can do that, we're going to show you more specifically how we'll do that on November the 19th. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And just maybe as we think about the next quarter, David, is the correct base for adjusted expenses as we think about a fourth quarter $872 million to $875 million? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : That is the basis on what you should extrapolate anything in the fourth quarter, yes. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Matt. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, Grayson. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, David, maybe a question for you. It looked like your long-term borrowings were up roughly two times quarter-over-quarter. I didn't \u2013 if I look at some industry sources, it didn't look like you had issued quite that much debt. Could you give us a little sense as to what's going on there? And also in terms of any preferred issuance that you might think about going forward to fill up that regulatory bucket? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Sure. So we did increase our long-term debt. We did have the debt issuance during the quarter. It was about $750 million, I think your \u2013 that you've seen. We did take out some short-term FHLB debt in place of long-term FHLB debt. Part of that was to fund loan growth. Part of that's sitting in cash as well as we think about LCR. But that was really the big \u2013 the biggest driver. And the second part of the question...? Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : In terms of any possible preferred issuance going forward? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : So, we do acknowledge we probably need a little more non-common Tier 1. And to issue it right now, without a good place to put the proceeds, though, is really cost-prohibitive. The carry on that is something we want to avoid. If we can kind of work that through our optimization of our capital stack over time, I think would be the better play for us as we trade out a more expensive common instrument for a less expensive preferred issuance and get our delta, delta between common equity Tier 1 and our Tier 1 to be a little better than we have today. So, you'll see that in time. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sure. Makes sense. Barb, my follow-up's directed towards you, I mean, if I take, I guess, an admittedly conservative view of the $30 million to $50 million range that you've talked about over the next 12 months, that's roughly a 1.5% loss rate on your overall energy exposure. How does that compare, perhaps, with the 12 month to 18 month loss rate that you may have had on an energy portfolio back in the 2008-2009 timeframe when energy prices were down about 70%? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Yeah, we look back on that timeframe and we had very few losses. If I recall, it was something give or take around $8 million, I think, and we've had none since then. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, Grayson. Good morning. David, maybe you can share with us, on the LCR I think you said you guys are well positioned to reach the, I guess 90% is where most of the regional banks need to be by January of 2016. Assuming that's correct, if rates don't change in 2016 and you then lift the LCR to 100% next year to reach the January of 2017 target, should we expect some margin pressure as you do that, if you're not already at 100%? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think you would see some downward pressure there. I would not call it significant. We continue to have \u2013 that's why we're positioned where we are today. And we have a little bit more in cash. It has already weighed down our margins. Over time, there could be a little bit of further compression, but not significant enough \u2013 not a significant amount. Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. And on the follow-up question, you've given us good detail on the oil portfolio and how you guys have looked at it. One of the banks, JPMorgan, when they released numbers gave us some sensitivity analysis suggesting if oil got to $30 a barrel they would take another $500 million to $750 million in reserves. Have you guys stress-tested this portfolio? I know you're using the future prices and discounting it back for the next 12 months to 18 months, but have you gone beyond that, saying if oil got to $35, $30 or $25 a barrel, what would happen to the portfolio? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : This is Barb. We have not run those models specifically with a $30 number, but we have done an awful lot of dialogue on what happens if it goes to $30. And it's not just a matter of the price; it's the speed at which it would go down to $30. If it goes down to $30 slowly over time, everyone has an opportunity to adjust their CapEx, adjust their expense models, et cetera. If it goes quickly, of course you're going to feel more pain. But, so far, what we've found with our customers is they have taken all of the right measures at the right pace to make sure that they're adjusting their operating models as quickly as they can. Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. I was wondering if you could give your perspective on the Houston market specifically right now and what you're seeing in terms of your overall Texas loan growth. David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Jennifer, we couldn't hear you very well. Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm sorry. Could you give us some commentary on what you're seeing in the Houston economy right now? And what you're seeing in terms of the company's Texas loan growth over the last three months to six months? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think when you look at the markets that we're seeing in Texas, clearly we're still seeing some good strength in most of the markets in Texas. Obviously, there's some softness in Houston. We have \u2013 we're spending a lot of time focused on that market because it's one of the markets most exposed to the energy industry and our customers that are there. But, so far, the Texas markets have held up surprisingly well. As Barb had mentioned a moment ago, the consumer in particular has shown some good strength in terms of benefiting from the lower pump prices, but also there's a lot of diversification in a lot of the economy in Texas. I think everyone's worried about what the contagion that may occur in some of these markets. Quite frankly, we haven't seen it in Houston yet. We look for it, especially in the commercial real estate market, which we're monitoring very closely. Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : I'd add a little bit to that. This is Barb. Demand continues across all the Texas markets vigorously, in fact, for newly constructed single-family housing, particularly in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio. In Houston, it's decelerated somewhat for newly constructed units exceeding $600,000, so pretty high price point. But sales of the lower priced units, those under $600,000 continue at a healthy clip. And the home builder industry has responded pretty quickly. They've reduced construction activity. We look at that \u2013 looking at permits, et cetera. So, again, the market has been adjusting to the reduction in the oil prices. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Werner of Morningstar. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Dan. Dan Werner - Morningstar Research : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. With respect to \u2013 just a little more color on the commercial portfolio. Is it primarily from drawdowns from existing lines or is there a more organic growth? And maybe kind of give some color on the energy in terms of the lines themselves. It looks like you still had some increase in midstream. I was wondering if that's from existing lines and kind of how you guys are addressing those. John M. Turner, Jr. - Senior Executive Vice President, Head-Corporate Banking Group : So, this is John Turner. I would say that the commercial growth that we see is fairly broad-based and it is both a reflection of customers borrowing under lines of credit, though, we actually saw about a 30 basis point reduction in utilization of lines of credit during the quarter. And customers borrowing to finance transactions to acquire new businesses, to expand, to add to their working capital or support their working capital needs associated with expansion of their businesses. So we've seen a variety of activities that have resulted in growth in the book, and as we said, that growth has occurred across our businesses, particularly in real estate and in our corporate banking business across our specialized industries verticals. Good growth in power utilities, in our restaurant book, in technology and defense. So we think nicely diversified and reflecting good fundamentals in that sector of the economy. With respect to the energy book, we have added a couple of midstream names over the course of the last 12 months. We've done that typically through our Regions Business Capital group where we feel like we've got a very good asset support. Those particular customers are operating under longer term contracts. We think there's a lot of stability in that business and industry and we've seen an opportunity to grow a couple of nice relationships as a result of bringing those customers on. Dan Werner - Morningstar Research : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Vivek. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. I just wanted to check a couple of things. Firstly, the check posting order change that you'll were going to go through, did that start in the third quarter or is that coming in 4Q? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Yeah, Vivek, this will start in the fourth quarter. You'll see a piece of that. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, because I saw that your service charges were down 8% year-on-year, which is a little faster rate. Any color on that then? What's making that go down a little bit faster, David? David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : I just think it's more seasonality. There's really nothing that stood out for us. We continue to grow accounts and customers and feel good about service charges and I'll be a little more specific, that posting order will start about mid quarter for us, so we're still in that guidance we've given you on the posting order of $10 to $15 million per quarter. O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But no real changes in the third quarter. I mean, still growing accounts, growing transactions, growing balances. But seasonally we did see service charges slowdown. But I think it's just normal seasonal adjustments. David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : Vivek, were you comparing quarter-to-quarter or year...? Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, I was looking actually year-on-year for the minus 8%, quarter-over-quarter it was down \u2013 it was more flattish. Because the year-on-year was down 8% so I was trying to get a sense of is there a customer behavior further change or is anything else that's causing that. David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President : No, the primary driver there was, if you remember, we exited the Ready Advance product about a year ago so that was in your number last year that's not in your number this year. That was the biggest component of that difference. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. A quick question for Barb. Barb, last quarter you'll talked about national credits where you had some issues. Can you give us some update on where that stands? One of your peers this morning took some additional provisions for weakness based on global manufacturing conditions. Could you weave any thoughts on what you're seeing in relation to that into your comments too? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Yeah, the shared national credits, as you know, there's currently going to be two reviews a year. The second review is going to take place starting in November, but it's only for the large players. We will not be involved in that other than as a participant, so we'll get some of those results, likely January or so by the time they put the results out. Relative to the overall shared national credit book though. It's a very strong book, a very good book for us. We're happy with those credits. Again, we don't specifically look at the shared national credits and say because it's a shared national credit I reserve for it any differently. We look account by account, credit by credit; to see what the underlying issues are and what the appropriate level of reserve should be against it. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And any color on the manufacturing stuff that Fifth Third talked about this morning? They're seeing some weakness so they've taken some provisions. What are you seeing in your manufacturing clients? Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer : Yeah, what we're seeing is aluminum casting, steel companies, we're seeing a little bit of softness there, keeping an eye on that sector. But, again, as they move through our risk rating process, if any of those credits do deteriorate, of course they'll get a larger allowance as they move through our normal process. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks. M. List Underwood - Director of Investor Relations : Well, let me close and just say thank you for your time, your attention and your questions today. We would encourage you to attend our Investor Day on November 19 and we thank you, again, and we stand adjourned. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin. List Underwood : Thank you, Operator and good morning everyone. We appreciate your participation in our call today. Our presenters are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of www.Regions.com. Also let me remind you that in the call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking disclaimer that is located in the appendix section of the presentation. With that said, I will turn it over now to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Good morning and thank you, List. I want to say just a few words about List Underwood before we get started with our financial results. As we announced earlier this week, List will be retiring at the end of the month. He's been with Regions for 23 years and has been a trusted advisor and valued member of our management team. His impressive career spans 43 years and today marks his 90th earnings call with our company. List, congratulations, we will certainly miss you as you start your new phase in life and wish you the very best in retirement. List Underwood : Thank you, Grayson. Grayson Hall : Moving on to results, overall we're pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2015. During the year, we focused on the fundamentals, growing and deepening our customer relationships, while also strengthening our financial performance by investing in initiatives that will drive revenue growth and create a more efficient and effective organization in the future. As a result, we're a much stronger organization today and are committed to continuing to build sustainable franchise value. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $272 million, bringing our full-year 2015 total to $1 billion. Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.21 per diluted share and $0.76 per diluted share for the full year. These results reflect growth in total adjusted revenue despite a challenging operating environment. Importantly, we continue to deliver results in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including checking accounts, households, Regions360 relationships and credit card accounts. For example, checking accounts grew by more than 2% during the year and active credit cards increased 11%. We remain focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our needs-based approach to relationship banking and our 2015 results demonstrate that this approach is working. During the year, we delivered strong average deposit growth of $3 billion or 4%. The mix of our deposits continues to strengthen as 92% are now low cost deposits and as we have noted before, our markets provide us with unique and competitive advantages from a deposit composition perspective. In 2015, we achieved solid adjusted loan growth of $5 billion or 6% from the prior year. Adjusted loans and leases include a lease reclassification adjustments which David will speak to shortly. Both business and consumer grew loans with total production for the year of $66 billion, an increase of 12% from 2014. Business lending had an excellent year, growing adjusted loans 7%. Commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking all grew loans and 95% of our markets achieved loan growth, reflecting the strength of our business model as local bankers collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans. In particular, within corporate banking, our specialized industries group experienced solid growth led by technology and defense, as well as franchise restaurant. And the Real Estate Investment Trust lending business was strong throughout the year. Consumer lending was also strong in 2015. Total loans exceeded $30 billion at year end, an increase of 5% over 2014. Mortgage led this growth with loans increasing $496 million or 4%. Additionally, our new point of sale initiative bolstered growth in indirect lending with increased loans of $339 million. Additionally, credit card balances increased 7% from the previous year which drove growth in card and ATM income of $30 million or 9%. Total adjusted revenue for the year increased 2% over 2014, reflecting growth in the balance sheet and investments we made to grow and diversify our revenue. Capital markets income was exceptionally strong, increasing $31 million. Our recent acquisition of BlackArch Partners as well as our planned initiatives are expected to further augment capital markets' income in the future. Wealth management had a strong year with income increasing 10% over the prior year. Our focus to grow wealth management by continuing to retain, recruit and develop talent was evident in the success of our financial consultants and insurance initiatives. During 2015, we executed on our capital plan, returning 93% of earnings to shareholders which is expected to be one of the highest percentages among our peers. We also made several small yet important investments and acquisitions in 2015 that will help drive future income. These transactions were a prudent and optimal use of our capital, enabling us to expand our capabilities and product offerings to supplement future revenue growth. With respect to the economic environment, while the U.S. economy is still slow and steadily improving, there is a clear significant pressure from the global economy. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industries while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our energy portfolio. As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings in this portfolio. These shifts will continue if oil prices remain at current levels. However, we remain in close contact with our energy customers and believe that we're taking appropriate actions to mitigate vulnerabilities. We continue to prudently build reserves which now stand at 6% of our direct energy exposure. As a result, we're cautious, but we expect the future losses related to this portfolio to be managed. As we begin 2016, we remain committed to our three primary strategic initiatives. First, grow and diversify our revenue streams. Secondarily, to practice disciplined expense management and lastly, to effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan. We continue to operate in a challenging environment that requires us to focus on what we can control. To that end, as we discussed in our Investor Day in November of last year, it's essential that we take more aggressive steps as relates to expense management. Our goal is to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next three years, approximately 9% of the 2015 adjusted expense base. This plan which is underway will help us fund our growth initiatives and build sustainable franchise value. In summary, 2015 was a solid year for Regions. We accomplished a great deal while laying the foundation for future earnings growth. With that, I will now turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the fourth quarter. David? David Turner : Thank you and good morning everyone. I will take you through the fourth quarter details and then provide our expectations for 2016. As Grayson noted, 2015 was a solid year for Regions and the year ended particularly strong which sets us up well for 2016. Before I get started, during the fourth quarter, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effect on pretax income lowered net interest income and other financing income $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets totaling approximately $834 million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income or other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period. With respect to the balance sheet, adjusted loan and lease balances totaled $82 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and were up $1 billion or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending achieved solid growth withed adjusted balances totaling $52 billion at quarter end, an increase of 1%. Adjusted commercial loans grew $563 million or 1%. Commitments increased 2% and line utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3%. Consumer lending had another strong quarter with every loan category increasing. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Indirect auto lending increased 2% and other indirect lending which includes point of sale initiatives, increased $55 million linked quarter or 11%. We're pleased with the results of this new initiative. Year-to-date, loans in this portfolio have increased $339 million and we expect continued growth in 2016. Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 6% from the previous quarter and our penetration rate into our deposit base now stands at 17.3%, up 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year. Mortgage loan balances increased $81 million and total home equity balances increased $31 million from the previous quarter as new production continued to outpace portfolio runoff. Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $322 million and ending balances increased over $1.2 billion during this quarter. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points and total funding costs remained low at 26 basis points. With respect to deposits, we're primarily core deposit funded with 74% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low cost deposits were 92% of total deposits. Approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people and 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise. Let's look at how this impacted our results. Interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $866 million, essentially flat with last quarter. However, excluding the impact of the lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased $15 million or 2%. Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging and optimization strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase along with interest recoveries. The benefit from interest recoveries is not expected to be at this level in the first quarter, approximately $4 million less going toward. The overall increase in net interest income and other financing income was partially offset by fixed asset repricing. The net interest margin was 3.08%. However, excluding the lease adjustment, net interest margin was 3.13% or flat with the previous quarter. Total non-interest income increased 4% on an adjusted basis from the third quarter, driven primarily by gains on sales of affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM fees increased 3%, primarily related to an increase in commercial bank card usage, an increase in the number of active cards at 3.7% and an increase in seasonal consumer spending. Service charges were impacted by posting order changes that went into effect in early November and reduced non-interest income by approximately $7 million. We expect the ongoing impact of this change to be at the lower end of our previously stated $10 million to $15 million quarterly range. Wealth management income was down slightly quarter over quarter due to lower insurance income, partially offset by higher investment management and trust fee income. Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees. Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the fourth quarter were $873 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $861 million, representing a decline of $33 million or 4% from the prior quarter. This included a decrease of $24 million in FDIC fees, primarily due to additional expenses of $23 million in the third quarter related to prior assessments. The expected quarterly run rate for this expense is in the $22 million to $24 million range, excluding the impact of the proposed FDIC surcharge. Additionally, the fourth quarter benefited from lower expenses related to unfunded commitment cost of $12 million. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in severance related expenses. We also incurred $6 million of expenses related to 29 branch consolidations. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.4% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.7%. As discussed at Investor Day, we will continue to make investments to grow our business. However, we must be more efficient in everything we do. As Grayson noted, our plan to become a more efficient organization, including the elimination of $300 million in core expenses, is underway. Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $18 million to $78 million and represented 38 basis points of average loans. This increase was primarily related to one large charge-off in the energy loan portfolio. Total business services criticized and classified loans increased $117 million, driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans primarily within the energy portfolio. However, total non-accrual loans excluding loans held for sale declined from the third quarter. Troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs also declined, down 1% from the prior quarter. The provision for loan losses was $69 million and our allowance for loan losses was down 2 basis points to 1.36% at the end of the fourth quarter. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 141%. Regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices have declined, exposure remains manageable. Should oil prices remain at current levels, charge-offs will be in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. The energy charge-off taken this quarter reduces the previous range of $50 million to $100 million. Additionally, we currently have just over $150 million reserved or 6% of our direct energy exposure. Given where we're in the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices. Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During 2015, we returned $925 million to shareholders which included the repurchase of $621 million of common stock and $304 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan to deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83% and at the end of the quarter, we were fully compliant as it relates to the liquidity coverage ratio. Now let me give you an overview of our current expectations for 2016. We expect total loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis, excluding the impact of the operating lease reclassification. And regarding deposits, we expect full-year average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range. And commensurate with our loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase in the 2% to 4% range. Now, should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. As a result of our investments, we expect to grow adjusted non-interest income somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. We will continue to make investments in 2016. However, we have also begun to execute our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses, of which 35% to 45% will occur in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 63% in 2016 and positive operating leverage somewhere in the 2% to 4% range. We still expect our net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the current price of oil, we would expect to be at the top end of that range. In closing, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year. The investments we made in 2015 position us well for 2016 and beyond and we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. List Underwood : Thank you, David. We're ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now let's open the line, operator, for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Maybe we will just start off on credit. First, can you maybe give us a little more color on the loss you took, what type of loan was it? Is there any credit of left? I guess when you think about the reserve that you've taken, the roughly 6%, what does your reserve contemplate for oil prices? We've heard others say that if oil prices stayed at this level, you could see another incremental amount of provision. Just wondering what that number would be for you. Barb Godin : I will address the second part. The first part was an energy credit that's been around for a few years with M&A activity which originally led to the credit. It is a shared national credit. There's five banks involved in it. We saw some distress in this credit in the early part of the year. We have been working this credit really hard during the course of this year and it simply came to conclusion near tend the end of the year. What we've done is we have appropriately marked that credit. We've taken the loss on that credit as you've heard. And we've moved the residual balance into our held for sale and we anticipate that we will have that out of our held for sale numbers by the end of -- we're hoping January, but certainly this quarter it will be out of our numbers. Back to individual credit, the charge-off on that was approximately $25 million just for rounding. In terms of how we think about our reserve and look at prices as we work our way through our process, in the backs of our minds, we look at our price deck, our price deck is roughly $36 right now, sensitivity, $28.90. So we're looking in that range as we determine and establish what those numbers should be, but we're also looking very heavily at each and every individual customer, what their cash flow looks like, what our collateral looks like, what our asset coverage is. We currently have asset coverage of 1.71 times on the E&P book as an example. So again, in conversations and we have some ongoing conversations with our customers because we really do have a small number of customers, we still believe that repayment ability is adequate with them and again establish our reserves accordingly. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then David had commented in his prepared remarks that you're expecting charge-offs to be towards the high end of the 25 to 35. I guess from both a portfolio, whether it's metals and mining or some other related areas or even if it's across different geographies, whether it's Texas or Louisiana or anywhere else that's exposed to oil and gas, are you seeing any other changing in credit patterns? Whether it's ticks up in delinquencies or anything that's having an impact on either growth or the overall credit performance. Barb Godin : No, we're keeping a really close eye on all of that. There is some pressure certainly on commodities in general across the industry, as you know and that's just given the strong U.S. dollar, what's going on in Europe and in China in terms of the dislocation of the market. There is some pressure there. But we've seen nothing yet that is significantly concerning. Ryan Nash : All right. Maybe just one last quick one, David, just can you help us understand the trajectory of the net interest margin, I guess maybe both based on the forward curve and if we don't get any additional rate hikes in 2016, where do you think the NIM would trend over the course of the year? David Turner : A little bit of guidance in terms of -- if we don't get another change, we will be at the lower end of our 2% to 4% guidance that we've given you. Also gave you a little bit of guidance in my prepared comments in terms of margin. We did have unusual recovery, interest recoveries. We think about $4 million of that won't repeat going forward. But we're looking for a relatively stable NIM. This is adjusting by the way for the lease accounting. We were at 3.08% on net interest margin, 5 points related to lease adjustments, so 3.13% would have made us flat. And we're looking for a relatively stable, just to remind everybody, that's been 1 or 2 points either side of where we're, for 2016. So we're looking for that guidance in terms of growth in NII that we've really been focusing on to be that 2% to 4% through the year. So you may see some unusual changes in a given quarter, but you've got to keep the year in mind when thinking about NIIs or trajectory. Operator : Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS. David Eads : Maybe following up on energy, when I look at the -- you guys had some disclosure on the criticized loans which I thought was pretty interesting. When you look at it, the criticized loans are actually higher on a percentage basis in the E&P portfolio compared to oilfield services. So I was wondering if you could talk a little about what you're seeing that has you more comfortable with the exposures on the E&P side and I guess maybe a little bit less so on the oilfield services. Barb Godin : It's Barb Godin. I will be happy to answer that. As we do our redeterminations and we just finished up our fall redeterminations, just about done, what happens is as you readjust the borrowing base and again, for fall redeterminations this year, borrowing base adjustments downwards were a little under 8%. Notwithstanding if that causes an over-advance, what we will immediately do is call that loan a criticized loan and move it into a non-pass category. Again, that would account for the reason that we have roughly 48% of our E&P book that is shown right now as criticized. Having said that, we have a rigorous process as well around our oilfield services portfolio, as you can see on the chart that we did provide, 32 customers make up 75% of that portfolio. So we're able to stay in constant and close contact with them. Again, as we see any weakness there, again, we're very quick to move it into a criticized category. David Eads : Just maybe to follow up on that, on the E&P portfolio, if you have 400 -- close to half of the loans were in -- a lot of those were in an over-advanced position, I would think they'd only be further over-advanced position now where oil prices have gone since the redetermination was complete. So would that suggest that criticized loans, the real criticized exposure might even be higher than that? Barb Godin : No. If I take the spring redetermination that we did, that was somewhere between -- let's just use roughly 15% reduction in borrowing basis. Now we're saying there's an incremental 8%, I will round it up, on top of that, so roughly 23% reduction in borrowing base. Remember as well in the industry, customers get a six-month cure period in which they're able to cure and we have seen a number of customers. Again, those earlier in the year that had access to capital markets and even now those that are still very strong have access to capital markets and they're able to take themselves out of an over-advanced position. David Eads : Okay. Maybe just as we think about the dislocations we're seeing in the markets right now, I know it's fairly early, but do you guys have any sense of how that -- if this continues, how that would impact the strategy you guys have for growing the capital markets and wealth management businesses? Is there anything that's particularly sensitive to market activity levels that you'd be more concerned about the growth trajectory? David Turner : This is David. I will tell you that we're creating these new products and services. The driver of that is because our customers need that and we're looking to have a more fulsome offering to our customers. And we're out there talking to them and feel very good about where they stand right now which is why I reiterated our guidance for 2016 on things like loan growth being in the 3% to 5%. In our discussions with our customers, we still see the domestic economy being okay. We're looking at 2%, 2.5% GDP and so there is this dislocation that's happening here of late, but as we see our customers, we believe they need the products and services, the capital markets investments we're making we think are going to be very strong and looking for that to continue and help us get to that 4% to 6% growth rate that we're expecting in non-interest revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore IS. Steve Moss : It's actually Steve Moss for John. I guess first off for List, congratulations and good luck on your retirement here. List Underwood : Thank you. Thank you. Steve Moss : And wanted to ask about energy again. Just wondering here with regard to oil -- if it declines further to $20 to $25, let's say, what are your potential losses there? Grayson Hall : I will ask Barb to reiterate and complete this statement, but when we look at our energy portfolio, we have got a very disciplined process of calculating probability defaults and loss given defaults. We've got the redeterminations we're doing on the E&P portfolio twice a year. So we feel good about the level of rigor and discipline around our process that drives that evaluation of how much we reserve based on what we think the incurred losses may be. And so I think our confidence in that process is very solid. We're staying disciplined around that process and if oil prices continue to decline, that process is going to drive risk ratings down on some of our credits and will drive a higher level of criticized classified loans and will drive how we reserve against those loans. But it will be on an incurred loss basis. Until that incurred loss occurs from an accounting perspective, our process is going to determine that. So Barb, you want to add too? Barb Godin : I think what I would add to that is, the operative word here being how long will oil prices stay depressed and you mentioned somewhere in the $20 a barrel range. And again, if it's in the $20 a barrel range and it stays there for an entire year, it could be in terms of charge-offs -- this is not provision -- could be up to an incremental $50 million and that is based on some back of the envelope versus anything precise, I would have to tell you. But again, that's not our view and I don't think it's the view of the industry at this point that oil is going to stay sub-$30 for any length of time. Steve Moss : Okay. And then with regard to the criticized level, you indicated on the E&P is 48%, was just wondering what is the total amount of criticized loans in the energy portfolio? Barb Godin : Total amount of criticized loans in terms of everything including the operating leases we had, $900 million. Steve Moss : Yes. Okay. Barb Godin : $900 million on 3.2 or 28%. Steve Moss : And then I guess one more thing. With regard to the margin, just a little more color here in terms of short-term expectations for the margin given the first Fed hike, how we should think about the margin in first quarter. David Turner : So I try to give you a little bit more global view of where we thought NII margin was going. So we start breaking it down. We get pretty granular. There's puts and takes either way. If you just want to focus on that component of the December increase, we're probably benefiting in the $5 million to $10 million range in the first quarter, but remember there's some other things going the other way. You've got day counts, about a $5 million working against you. You've got the interest reversal of $4 million that I talked about in my prepared comments. So I think it's better to look overall at the guidance in terms of relatively stable margin and growth in NII in that 2% to 4% range commensurate with the loan growth that we talked about of 3% to 5%. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : So on energy again, looking at the build from 4.7% reserves that you talked about at the Investor Day for 3Q up to the 6% and then taking into account the charge-offs as well, to me it looks like almost all of the provisioning in the quarter related to the energy portfolio. Is that the right way to be thinking about it or am I missing something there? Barb Godin : No, you're actually thinking about it right. If you look at the balance of our book, the balance of our book actually improved and we were able to reallocate that provision over to the energy customer. David Turner : If you looked at the credit quality of our book and you ex energy, then the balance of our book performed very well this past quarter and we continue to see improvements in almost all of our credit metrics. But if you look at -- you add the energy back in and to Mark's point, there's stress in that sector, but because the way our portfolio's performing, it allowed us to build reserves around the energy portfolio. Geoffrey Elliott : Just a follow-up, you've mentioned commodities a couple of times in the discussion. Can you just remind us where the other commodities exposures are and how stress in commodities beyond oil and gas could have some impact on credit? Barb Godin : As I think about commodities, firstly our book in commodities we have roughly $400 million in fabricated metal and primary metals and another $430 million, so just to give you a rough sense for the size of the book. Again, a lot of those commodities in terms of metals, that's also an indirect hit, so to speak, from what's happening in the oil sector because they rely on a lot of those metals to provide piping, et cetera. You're seeing a secondary knock-on effect and one that we're keeping a close eye on. Grayson Hall : We have a fairly minor exposure to agriculture. Barb Godin : Yes, $800 million in ag. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : Question for you maybe on the expenses, you had some nice progress here in the quarter. I'm wondering is any of that going to reverse out in the coming quarter, especially maybe that $12 million on unfunded commitments that was saved? And maybe beyond that, are you still expecting about 35% to 45% of the $300 million in saves to come out here in 2016? Grayson Hall : So we do expect 35% to 45% of the $300 million to come out in 2016. And you're right, the reason we broke that out separately is that is not something that's expected to benefit at least to the degree we had in the second quarter. So we wanted to call it out separately so you could take that into account in your model. Stephen Scouten : Okay. And just on a net basis, do you still believe that the $300 million really just allows you to keep overall expenses relatively flat and maybe even still up on a total dollar amount for 2016? Grayson Hall : That's right, Stephen. We're calling for continuing to make investments to grow NIR, utilizing our savings of the $300 million, at least the 35%, 45% of that to help us keep expenses relatively flat to up modestly from the level that we're reporting for 2015. Stephen Scouten : And then maybe if I could on capital and the buyback, it seems like you got about $350 million remaining maybe relative to the CCAR ask. Could that be accelerated in the quarter based on where the stock is trading now with it under tangible book? Is that something where you guys can take advantage of where the stock's trading currently? Grayson Hall : Any change to -- $350 million is right, $175 million generally in each quarter. In order to change the amount and/or timing requires an approval from our regulatory supervisors and there is a mechanism for doing that. But we have to assess that and can't guarantee there would be any change from what's already been approved. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. John Hearn : This is actually John Hearn on for Gerard. Just two questions for you. The first back to the criticized balance for the energy portfolio, can you tell us what it was in the third quarter? Barb Godin : Criticized balance? It was roughly $300 million less. John Hearn : $300 million less. Barb Godin : I can get you an exact number after the call. John Hearn : And then more broadly, the regulators in December I believe they expressed some concern about underwriting standards for CRE and construction lending. Can you comment a bit about what you're seeing in those segments and are you beginning to see any changes since the comments came out? Barb Godin : No, in fact, we're feeling very good about our book CRE and construction lending, we used to have a book that was very heavy previously going back several years. And we've taken a lot of lessons from that to ensure that we understand what we're putting on our books and that we need to feel comfortable both in a stress situation as well as a normal situation. So we have been very deliberate about what we're putting on the books. We have not had very much growth, came off a very low base in terms of growing that book and again, very deliberate on the types of credits that we're willing to underwrite. So again from a credit perspective, I feel very comfortable. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : Just wanted to ask about where acquisitions may fit in, in select markets if at all this next year. Grayson Hall : Chris, we certainly are very analytical and disciplined about how we focus on acquisitions. Quite frankly, our primary focus has been on bolt-on acquisitions in the non-bank space. 2015, we did two relatively small transactions that you're familiar with. We continue to look at the marketplace and we still think there's opportunities in both our wealth segment as well as our capital markets segment and insurance segments for bolt-on acquisitions. We continue to look. I think the expectation is these are going to be relatively small in size and still at this juncture we're -- valuations are that predominantly our interest is in the non-bank space. Christopher Marinac : Grayson, if pricing did change, would you reconsider the bank side or would that have to shift a lot to affect that? Grayson Hall : As markets change, we always reconsider. So markets change, we try to analyze what the changes are and see where the opportunities are. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Sterne Agee. Peter Winter : Just want to go back to the 2016 expectations. The operating leverage of 2% to 4%, if the revenues come in a little bit weaker than expected, would you guys let more of the expense saves fall to the bottom line to ensure that operating leverage that you're forecasting? David Turner : We looked at a lot of different scenarios, Peter, in terms of committing to the 2% to 4% or at least indicating if we could get to 2% to 4% operating leverage, there are a lot of different scenarios. We believe through our expectations of revenue growth and our expectations of expense management that we will get there. The combination of how we get there may change and we will adjust, adapt and overcome. But our goal is to generate that positive operating leverage regardless of the environment. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Micenko of SIG. Jack Micenko : One of the industry conferences in the fourth quarter, I think you had disclosed that you were moving towards the upper end on the branch closure range that you gave at Investor Day. Does that still hold you true? And then the second question would be, the cadence of those closures, should we think about -- is there any guidance we can think about in dealing with modeling some of those onetime charges that we saw like in this quarter? David Turner : Jack, so we did say we were looking at 100 to 150 branches. We said we would probably be towards the upper end of that through our strategic planning period. We've announced 29. We continue to look each and every day at how to best optimize our branch footprint which has included even opening some new ones at times. But it's hard to get the cadence down to give you that commitment up front because it's all facts and circumstances based. We have to look at our footprint, what's going on in the footprint. We have a lot of coordination that has to happen. What I can tell you is so we had a $6 million charge on the 29 branches that we closed or made a decision on consolidating this quarter. There will be another roughly $6 million associated with those branches, so it's -- call it $12 million. And we expect a payback on that of about two years which is what we've had historically. So all branches aren't created equal, they're all a little different. If you go back and look at all of our branch consolidations, it will give you a feel for what that charge might be over time, but it's hard for me to give you precise timing. Jack Micenko : And then obviously you have a large, large portion of your deposits are consumer. Have you been feeling any pressure on the commercial side to pass on any of the rate increase some of the other banks have talked about today? Grayson Hall : No, at this juncture we just have not seen deposit rate pressures. Given such a fairly modest increase in rates, the pressure from any part of our depository base has been very muted. We continue to watch very closely what our competitors are and watch very closely what our customers are saying to us. But quite to the contrary, we continue to grow deposits and in fact grow low cost deposits at a pretty healthy pace. And so we're not seeing that particular issue arise at this juncture. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : You made the comments that you're looking at acquisitions in the non-bank space. Could you describe that a little bit further and what targets you're looking at potentially in order to expand your fee income? David Turner : Sure. This is David. As Grayson mentioned, one of our strategic initiatives is to diversify our revenue and in this context diversification, is away from NII and into NIR. As we think about the desire to diversify and we think about how we can have a more full-some offering to our customers, things in capital markets come to mind. You saw our acquisition of BlackArch Partners, our M&A advisory firm. We looked at insurance entities. We will continue to do that, agencies, continue to expand there. We would like to have a more solid offering in fixed income sales and trading, so we're looking there. And I think that these acquisitions have a tendency to be smaller acquisitions, but they fit into our need and our desire to continue to diversify and we think fit very well with our strategy. Grayson Hall : And really serve -- they fit a customer need. Trying to identify the needs that our customers have and how we can serve those better, but at the same time, to David's point, diversify our revenue. But we make sure that these are incremental in nature, bolt-on acquisitions that don't -- that have a risk profile that we feel like is prudent. And so I think you should expect us to continue to look at those opportunities over 2016, but our primary focus as you've seen is on organic growth in the markets we're in today with the services we have today. But this is in addition to that. But primary focus is organic growth. Kevin Barker : Okay. And apologies if somebody might have mentioned this earlier. With regard to your CCAR in 2016, we had a pretty big impact from the stress test last year. Given the decline in oil prices and where you are now, do you anticipate a similar decline this time around and how are you preparing for CCAR going into 2016? David Turner : Well, so we got a lot of work going on with CCAR to be prepared for our submission in April. We look at a lot of different portfolios. I think from a credit standpoint, we mentioned earlier that ex energy, our credit portfolios are actually improving. That works one way in terms of the CCAR submission. Energy clearly needs to be taken into account. Barb laid out some of the stresses that we're seeing and how we will account for those. From our standpoint, we have one of the strongest levels of Common Equity Tier 1 of our peer group. We did return 93% of our earnings to our shareholders which we think was appropriate. And as a result, we didn't want to continue to accrete capital because we felt like we had enough capital to run our business in a prudent manner. We look at our stresses all the time, not just from a CCAR standpoint. We do that for ourselves to make sure we're managing and optimizing our capital in our company so that we have enough in times of stress and -- but not too much in terms of ensuring we can have an appropriate return to our shareholders. So exactly how all this will manifest itself in CCAR we will have to see and let the -- we run a lot of programs. We will just need to see what the results are. We don't see anything drastically different than what we have submitted before, ex-energy. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : Thanks for letting me hop on for one follow-up. I just wanted to confirm, that $50 million to $75 million in potential incremental off the oil space around here, that's assumed just for 2016 as I heard it. And so would we assume that there could be further tail risk if oil prices remain depressed for a longer period of time? List Underwood : That's right. That's a 2016 number. Obviously if oil stays low longer, then there is tail risk to that. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Well, with that, we stand adjourned. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

A copy of this presentation as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Also let me remind you that during today\u2019s call, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary from expectations. These factors are described in the cautionary disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release and in other reports we file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, Dana and good morning and thank you everyone for joining our call today. First quarter\u2019s results reflect a strong start to 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic plan. We are pleased by our continued progress, despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic backdrop. For the first quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $257 million, and earnings per share totaled $0.20. These results reflect growth in total revenue, lower adjusted expenses and positive operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth by expanding our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth accounts. A key driver to this success is our ability to leverage our approach to relationship banking. We are pleased that once again, we\u2019ve received external recognition for building a strong customer experience at Regions. This quarter, both the Temkin Group and the Greenwich Associates recognized Regions for providing industry leading customer experiences. Looking at our results further, we achieved total average loan growth of 5% compared to prior year. Consumer lending is off to a solid start as loan balances exceed $30 billion. We have introduced new initiatives to expand our consumer product offerings, which led to year-over-year growth in consumer lending of 5%. Our new point of sale initiative within indirect lending led this growth with more loans that doubled over the prior year, exceeding our internal expectations. We do expect continued growth in this product category in 2016. Indirect auto lending continues to grow as balances increased over 9% compared to last year. Credit card balances increased modestly as we remain focused on expanding a number of customers that carry and utilize Regions\u2019 credit card and we have experienced success on this front as our penetration rate of deposit customers has increased 140 basis points from one year ago and now stands at 17.5%. We\u2019re also focused on expanding our direct consumer lending capabilities as we recently announced and agreed with Avant. This arrangement allows us to offer additional alternatives to create stronger digital experiences for our customers and prospects. We\u2019ve also had an encouraging quarter in business lending, with total average loans up 4% over the prior year. All of our business lending areas, corporate banking, commercial banking and real estate banking achieved growth over the prior year. Total adjusted revenue increased 7% over the first quarter of 2015, reflecting effective execution on our strategic plans to grow and diversify our revenue. Investments within capital markets are clearly demonstrating progress as capital markets income more than doubled versus fourth quarter of \u201815. Importantly, our efficiency initiatives are allowing us to sub-fund these investments as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the previous quarter. We ended the quarter with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 60.6%, an improvement of 280 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. With respect to the current environment, we continue to expect the US economy to demonstrate progress but at a measured pace. The global and macroeconomic environment remains a concern but we do expect modest improvement. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our direct energy portfolio as well as portfolios subject to contingent. As expected there continues to be downward migration in risk rates, we are supporting and working closely with our customers as they take appropriate and constructive actions to lower costs, reduce debt and improve liquidity. We do anticipate continued stress in the sector and will make appropriate adjustments. Additionally, we have established appropriate energy reserves which now stand at 8% of our direct energy exposure. But more broadly excluding energy in related industries, we do see continued favorable credit quality in the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Turning to capital deployment, as you are aware, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month, we continue to pull over capital effectively through organic growth and investing strategically in initiatives to increase revenue or reduce expenses. But we also will return an appropriate amount of capital to shareholders. In closing, our solid first-quarter results provide evidence that we are successfully executing our strategic plan with a continued commitment on our three primary strategic initiatives which are grow and diversify our revenue streams, practice disciplined express management, and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan and we are on track to deliver our long-term performance targets. With that I\u2019ll turn it to Dave who will cover the details for the first quarter. David Turner : Thank you and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances increased to $51 billion, up 1% from the previous quarter and 4% over the prior year. Commercial loans grew $373 million or 1% was driven by corporate banking and real estate banking. Specialized lending also contributed to loan growth driven by new relationships in technology and defense, restaurant as well as an increase in line utilization in energy and natural resources. Commitments were flat linked quarter and line utilization increased 110 basis points to 47.8%, primarily driven by energy lending which increased from 53% to 56%. Total production declined 26% from the prior quarter and we are beginning to experience softer pipelines in some areas due to less optimistic and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, consumer lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 3%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter and 5% over the prior year. And direct auto lending increased 2% and production increased 4% during the quarter. Other indirect lending which includes point-of-sale initiatives increased $76 million linked quarter or 15% as production increased 120%. Now looking at the credit card portfolio, average balances increased 2% from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing customer base currently stands at 17.5%. Mortgage loan balances increased $75 million and total home-equity balances were relatively flat, up $8 million from the previous quarter. Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $262 million from the previous quarter and increased $2 billion over the prior year. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points and total funding costs remained low at 28 basis points. With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit funded with 67% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low cost deposits make up 92% of our total deposits and approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people. Additionally, 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we continue to believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.  So let's see how it has impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $883 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter. However, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $12 million or 1% for the quarter and increased $51 million or approximately 6% compared to the prior year. Higher loan balances and increases in short term rates along with items that are unlikely to repeat including lower premium amortization and higher dividend income related to trading assets were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase. This increase was partially offset by lower dividends recognized on Federal Reserve stock, higher debt interest expense and one less day in the quarter. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.19%. Excluding the impact from the fourth quarter lease adjustment, the net interest margin increased by approximately 6 basis points. The 5 basis points of this increase was attributable to the impact of day count during the quarter and the previously mentioned items that are unlikely to repeat. Total non-interest income increased 1% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter driven by growth in our revenue diversification initiatives as we successfully executed our strategies. In particular, capital markets income was strong on a linked quarter basis, up 46%. This was driven by contributions from the recently expanded mergers and acquisition advisory services group.  Additionally, revenue was bolstered by fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers as well as syndicated loan transactions. And due to the nature of the business, and the fact that we are building out our capabilities, capital markets income will likely experience some movement from quarter to quarter. However, we are very pleased with the impact our added capabilities are producing. Wealth management also experienced a strong quarter despite a challenging market environment. Income was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due to higher seasonal insurance income and impact from recent acquisitions. Investment services income was up 7% attributable to an increase in annuity sales. However, investment management and trust fees were negatively impacted by market conditions. Seasonality and posting order changes that went into effect in early November last year impacted service charges which declined 4% from the fourth quarter. Now, looking ahead, we expect modest growth in service charges as we benefit from last year's 2% checking account growth and continued account growth in 2016. In addition, seasonal declines in consumer spending drove the decline in card and ATM fees for the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, card and ATM fees increased approximately 12%. Other non-interest income included reductions to revenue of $12 million reflecting market decreases in relation to asset sale for certain employee benefits which is offset in salaries and benefit expense. Quarter-over-quarter, mortgage revenue was up 3%. Additionally, in the quarter, we purchased the rights to service approximately $2.6 billion of mortgage loans bringing our total residential servicing portfolio to $40 billion and we will continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to expand our mortgage servicing portfolio. During the quarter we also had a $14 million increase in income related to bank-owned life insurance. This was primarily attributable to claims business as well as a gain on exchange of policies. We expect the run rate going forward will be in the $18 million to $20 million quarterly range.  Let\u2019s move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the first quarter were $869 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $843 million, representing a decline of $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter as we implement our efficiency initiatives. As previously noted, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced plans to consolidate 29 branches as part of our strategic plan to close 100 to 150 branches.  In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $14 million of property related expenses, primarily related to the branch consolidation and additional occupancy optimization initiatives. In addition, we incurred $12 million of severance expense related to staffing reductions. Excluding the impact of severance charges in the current and previous quarter, salaries and benefits decreased $9 million or 2% linked quarter. And this decrease was primarily due to a 2% reduction in staffing as well as lower expenses attributable to market decreases in relation to assets held for certain employee benefits that I just discussed. This was partially offset by seasonal increases in payroll taxes of $12 million and increased incentives related to fee-based revenue growth.  Professional and legal expenses declined primarily due to a favorable legal settlement of $7 million, which is not expected to recur going forward. FDIC fees increased $3 million from the previous quarter and as previously disclosed, we expect FDIC fees to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis when the FDIC assessment surcharge is implemented. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.6% in the first quarter driven primarily by growth in new revenue initiatives, which have been funded by expense eliminations. Our plan to become a more efficient organization is well underway.  Let's move to asset quality. Total net charge-offs decreased $10 million to $68 million and represented 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $113 million and our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.41% at the end of the quarter, which compares to 1.36% of total loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase in the allowance is primarily attributable to an increase in direct energy related loan reserves. Total loan loss allowance for the energy loan portfolio was 8% at the end of the first quarter compared to 6% at the end of the fourth quarter.  Beginning primarily in the third quarter of 2015, low oil prices began to drive the migration of a number of large energy credits into criticized loans, primarily in the exploration and production and oil field services sectors. Continued low oil prices prompted further migration of some of those credits into classified loans this quarter. As a result, total business services criticized and classified loans increased $254 million, including an increase in classified loans of $703 million and a decrease in special mention loans of $449 million. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $211 million from the fourth quarter. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 116%. Additionally, troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs declined 2% from prior quarter.  Now, regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices remained volatile, exposures remained manageable. Should prices remain in the $30 to $45 range, we continued to expect losses in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. And should oil prices average $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses in the $100 million range. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals, and agricultural are starting to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. However, we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility and certain critical metrics can be expected especially related to larger dollar commercial credits. Let's move on to capital liquidity. During the first quarter, we returned $255 million to shareholders including the repurchase of $175 million of common stock and $80 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. So let me provide an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016, which remain consistent with those we delivered at our Investor Day last fall and also on our earnings call in January. We expect total loans to grow 3% to 5% on an average basis relative to fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Given current softer market conditions in the commercial space, we could track towards a lower end of that range. Regarding deposits, we continue to expect average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 average balances. Now commensurate with loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase 2% to 4% on a full-year basis. Should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. In addition, the higher end of the range is more challenging due to the lower dividends on the Federal Reserve stock. Now with respect to the net interest margin, we will likely experience modest pressure if rates remain low. However, further increases in short-term rates will serve to stabilize the margin. As a result of our investments, we continue to grow adjusted non-interest income and expect that in the 4% to 6% range on a full-year basis. We will continue to make investments in 2016. However, our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is underway and we expect to achieve 35% to 45% of that number in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from the level in 2015. We expect to achieve a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio less than 63% and positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. We also continue to expect net charge offs in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we would expect to be at the top end of that range this year. In closing, the first quarter was a strong start to the year and we are encouraged by our results. The investments made in 2015 and before position us well for 2016 and beyond and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A session of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up in order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning. We will now open the lines for question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Michael Rose : Maybe we can just start on the energy portfolio, can you give us a sense for kind of how much, how far you\u2019re through the kind of the spring borrowing base redetermination, I assume you\u2019re just kind of in the earlier stages. And now that we\u2019ve seen the rebound in oil, I mean, how confident would you be if oil stayed around these levels that you might come in closer to the lower end of your kind of charge-off range for the year, about $50 million to $75 million related to energy? Thanks. Barb Godin : Michael, it\u2019s Barb Godin. I\u2019ll go ahead and answer the question in terms of our spring redetermination. We\u2019re roughly 25% of the way through and so far to date, we\u2019ve seen roughly 20, perhaps 25% reduction in the oil base is our expectation and in terms of the guidance that we\u2019ve given relative to charge-offs for the rest of the year, again, we\u2019ve run our models. We feel very good about where our numbers are. We do still anticipate that there will be volatility in the oil prices. And again, that\u2019s the reason that we\u2019re looking at $25 a barrel over the next two years, which would again create $100 million of incremental loss we think next year and $50 million to $75 million this year. David Turner : Michael, we\u2019re continuously working with our customers and monitoring their financial situations as they\u2019re trying to rationalize their expenses, their spending base as well as trying to restructure their capital base. Obviously, if we saw stability of oil prices at this low, it will be a benefit to those customers, but as we go through our credit analysis, we aren\u2019t making that assumption. We continue to stress our portfolio to what we think the possibilities of the volatility are and so if it turns out to be stable at a higher point, then I think that\u2019s a good day for our customers and a good day for us, but we aren\u2019t necessarily trying to anticipate that in our credit review process. Michael Rose : Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, it looks like the unfunded commitments were down about $150 million quarter-to-quarter, are you guys actually trying to grow new credits at this point and where should we expect maybe that unfunded balance to close out over the next year or so? Thanks. Barb Godin : Again, Michael, it\u2019s Barb. As we look at the unfunded balance, you\u2019re right, it was down $165 million. A lot of that was paid down at the lines. They were a handful of draws that we saw, not that many and there was a little bit of new business that was primarily in our midstream section. Midstream continues to perform well and even in a down industry, there are some very good customers out there and the credits that we put on the books, those are four credits, three of them in fact, which is existing relationships. We knew those customers very well. One was a new customer that we\u2019ve been quoting for a while. Very pleased with the quality of the credits that we\u2019ve done. We don\u2019t see a lot of additional credit, but again, we will continue to look for opportunities in the segment, if they present themselves and if they meet our credit quality guidelines. David Turner : And Barb, if you could just comment on level of commitments year-over-year and where we see that going forward? Barb Godin : Certainly. We started January of \u201815 with commitments at $6.9 billion and we right now sit at $4.8 billion. So we\u2019ve come down a fair bit on commitments. If I do the same comparison for you on outstandings, those outstandings went from $3.3 billion down to $2.7 billion at that same timeframe. So again, as we think about utilization, what happens as you know is as we do our borrowing base redeterminations that reduces our outstanding commitments and just as a general rule of thumb for every $100 million that we reduced at our commitments, that will naturally, just favor to your math, increase your utilization rate by 85 basis points. Michael Rose : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And maybe just one follow-up for me David, just to clarify, I think you said that there is no more rate increases this year that you\u2019d expect to be at the lower end of the NII guidance, did I hear that correctly? David Turner : That\u2019s correct. Michael Rose : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura. Bill Carcache : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some of your -- the comments you just made, can you share with us what kind of utilization rate assumption is implicit in your current allowance and the methodology that gets you comfortable with that? Barb Godin : Yeah. We don\u2019t really use a utilization rate per se. What drives our allowance is our risk rating process. The risk rating process takes into account all the information that we know about the customer, what\u2019s going on in the industry. Looking at their financials deeply and again, yes, we do refer to what they would have for example in their borrowing base, what our petroleum engineers say about it. So again, we don\u2019t have a specific number that we use, what I can tell you about the draws and the utilization is as we look at the energy and production customers, the E&P customers, again they are governed by borrowing base, so we see some natural ability for draws not to happen there. And then as we look at our oil field services customers, we have a number of covenants, a number of leverage covenants that are there. We also have anti-cash hoarding provisions that we have been putting in for the last several months as accounts have been coming up for renewal. So again that will naturally reduce their ability to draw on those lines. Bill Carcache : I see. That\u2019s helpful. So under this stress scenario that you guys lay out, where you show that if oil prices average $25 a barrel through 2017, the expectation that will result in additional $100 million of charge-offs in that kind of stress environment, it would seem that there may be more draws on existing unfunded lines, but I was trying to understand to what extent that was being captured in the methodology, but it sounds like the increase in draws under stress scenarios is not something that is captured. So maybe if you could just give a little bit of commentary on that. Barb Godin : Yes, there is a difference between how we reserve and how we do our stress testing. And on our stress testing, we are actually looking at our entire committed book and reviewing that and finding all the various stresses against the committed book. Bill Carcache : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR and Company. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Paul. Tim Hayes : Hey, guys. This is Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. First off, in regard to your Avant relationship, where do you see annual originations trending there and where exactly on the balance sheet of those loans being held? Grayson Hall : So as you have seen, we have invested in a number of digital partnerships to try to improve our offerings to customers, predominantly consumers and small businesses in the digital space. We have announced a partnership with Avant. That partnership while communicated will not launch until third quarter. So we have not provided any forecast on revenues and originations to the market at this day. Tim Hayes : Understood. And then you had just mentioned that barring any type of interest rate hikes this year that you will stay at the low-end of your NII guidance. Where do you see NIM tracking barring any hikes, are you able to sustain the current level of your abnormality [ph] see any type of deterioration? David Turner : Yes, thanks. So we had a couple of things in the quarter on my prepared comment, take out the end piece of that, and we had some things won\u2019t repeat. So we said five points of that really are things that you won\u2019t see going forward. After that, if rates continue to stay where they are right now, we will see our net interest margin continuing to decline, so we do need some rate lift to stabilize the net interest margin. As most of us in the industry have been focusing on NII growth, it\u2019s really the guidance that we have given you that 2% to 4% and we think is more meaningful, but margins will come under pressure if rates stay here. Tim Hayes : Understood. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question will come from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, good morning. I want to get back to the energy commitments and I was curious if the case of the decline in the commitments could accelerate just naturally as the business flows for the rest of the year? Barb Godin : Again, it\u2019s Barb, and again, if you do just a back of the envelop and assume that 25% reduction in the borrowing bases, again, that would naturally translate into roughly a $1.2 billion in reduction on existing commitments taking them down from 4.8, somewhere down to the 4.5, 4.6 range, so yes, it will reduce. Christopher Marinac : Okay. And then Barb, is the ongoing SNC exam going to influence the criticized numbers come out had we seen a lot of that change already this last quarter. Barb Godin : Yes, we have fully incorporated the Shared National Credit exam into our results this quarter. Christopher Marinac : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS. David Eads : Hi, good morning. You made some comments at the beginning about seeing a little bit of softness in from commercial side in terms of demand for loan. I was curious if you could flush that out a little bit. Is that related \u2013 you also talked about some pressure on some of the ancillary energy companies, is it related to those type of companies or more broad based and are there any specific areas where you are seeing some softening loan demand? David Turner : I think if you look at what we\u2019ve started seeing in the fourth quarter and certainly carrying into the first quarter, while we\u2019ve seen good growth in balances in our wholesale book and our consumer book, we have seen some softness in demand when you look at our sales pipelines for wholesale credit. Clearly the industry segments that are energy related are energy dependent in particular metals, minings and assorted commodities. Those industry segments obviously are very soft, but we\u2019ve seen a general slowdown or softness, if you will, in wholesale credit demand. We don\u2019t know if that is a sustainable trend or whether that\u2019s sort of a first quarter anomaly, but at this point in time we were just signaling that we see demand just a little softer, still very competitive market and we are still able to find ways to serve our customers and extend credit. We feel good about our level of engagement with our customers, but I think given the market volatility since the first of the year, we are just seeing customers be a little bit more reserved, if they will, in terms of accessing credit facilities. David Eads : All right, thanks. And then maybe just I am curious if you have any color on \u2013 you\u2019ve got the final DOL fiduciary rule, if that\u2019s going to have any real impact on your wealth management business? I am just curious whether \u2013 how that interaction kind of plays? David Turner : Well, I mean, I think it\u2019s a great question and one that as the rule has come out, out team is working on, but I think the positive news is we\u2019ve been working under a fiduciary model in our wealth management group for a very, very long time. We are very familiar with the fiduciary model and comfortable with it. We feel like we know how to operate in that environment. We do think that given the rules, we\u2019ve got a year to implement rules as they proposed and our teams are working closely with that, but given the history and the makeup of our book, we think it\u2019s a very manageable process for us. David Eads : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : Hey, guys, good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Stephen Scouten : Question for you on the kind of the efficiency ratio and the continued operating leverage. I mean, obviously you had a great quarter here in 1Q and well positioned for the rest of the year, but can you kind of give me some thoughts about the \u2013 on the sub-63% guidance relative to how you are already at the kind of 60.6% level today and what the trends might look like? David Turner : Yeah, it\u2019s great question. So we want certainly guidance factor this just under 63% as we shared with you before because we are continuing to also make investments to grow revenue. There is timing differences that can get in our numbers. If you read our supplement carefully, you will see there is some timing differences there as well. We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on controlling our expenses in this first quarter and see that continuing throughout the year and frankly for years to come as we have $300 million expense program. But remember the point of that is not just to improve efficiencies, it\u2019s really to make room for the investments we want to make to continue to grow and diversify our revenue steam and you will see continued investments there. There is some new things like our M&A advisory group that just came onboard in the fourth quarter. They had a pretty solid first quarter as we mentioned. We expect that to continue to grow and you will see their revenue growth, but you will see expenses associated with that business continue to grow as well. So we think it is more appropriate to go back to the 63% in the last efficiency ratio versus leveraging the 60.6%. Stephen Scouten : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up on the NIM conversation, so if I understand it properly, we are kind of using maybe 3.14 as a real starting point as we look into the subsequent quarters, I know you're trying to focus more on NII but as I look at that NIM, I mean do you think that could be a 2 to 3 basis points a quarter kind of compression at higher rates? David Turner : Yeah I think so, you start point is fair. So there are five points in there that we want to reset down from 3.19 to your 3.14 number. And there it's really kind of rate depended, I think if we stay at low rates, you\u2019ll see that coming down some. If you get an increase maybe that stabilizes a bit. So I think you'll have margin pressure unless we get the move - get a move sometime in 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore IS. John Pancari : On the color that you gave around the NIM this quarter and some of those items, on the premium am, I just want to if you can clarify that you know the tenure was down through the quarter and mortgage rates saw a little bit of that. So how do you actually see lower premium am, I would think it would be higher? Grayson Hall : Well it's a little bit of, John stated, there is little bit of a lag effect there, you\u2019re right we actually saw the other way half our premium amortization was a little lower in the first quarter than it had been in the fourth quarter, so to the tune of about $5 million. And that's as we see the tenure drop, you would expect more activity coming through in the second quarter and more premium amortization and that's part of what we are trying to signal that won't recur from an NII standpoint. So you have a $5 million, $7 million roughly of NII benefit in the first quarter, all things being equal that you won't see in the second quarter. John Pancari : Then secondly, on the loan loss reserve for energy, I know you gave us the direct energy reserve of now it's 8% versus 6% before. What is the energy reserve for the total energy book, so direct energy and the indirect, what is the reserve for that because you gave us the criticize for that but not the reserve. Barb Godin : And we don't reserve it that way, again they fall into different categories, so as we look at both the individual customers et cetera, they roll up differently, don't have that detail but remember that the reserves that we have in total is available to absorb all loan losses irrespective of if they were in energy or not. John Pancari : And then lastly, on expenses just want to see if I can get a little more color on the comp expense this quarter came in lower than expected and just want to see if you can give some color on the outlook there. Thanks. Grayson Hall : Yeah, so our comp expense was down even though we had favorable taxes, there are some things that as I mentioned we are continuing to make investments. And I do think that we have our marine increase that happened kind of mid-quarter, we have our certain incentive grants, they are long-term grants that start in the second quarter but you will see expenses coming through on that too. So I think that we are off to a good start, we are down 538 full-time equivalents start to finish in the quarter. You\u2019ll see some run on benefits because all then happened January 1. But, you should see us, you don\u2019t see that pick up a bit even though we have favorable tax benefit that won't repeat. We do have some investments and what I mentioned on the compensation increases that will come through in second and later quarters. John Pancari : And then related to that, sorry one more thing just around, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on operating leverage for the full year given your NIM expectation and spread revenue expectation that you mentioned but also what you just said here around expenses where they're trending? Grayson Hall : So we are guiding you to 2% to 4% operating leverage. I think if rate stay flat and we have NII close to that 2 or below or end of the range that\u2019s a big driver of our operating leverage. And so you would expect to be at the lower range on operating leverage. We feel pretty confident that we\u2019ll be within that, I know we are well ahead of that range in this first quarter but we think it's more appropriate to guide you towards the 2% to 4%. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Rob from Matt\u2019s team. I was just curious how, have you guys disclosed how much energy charge-offs were this quarter, did you guys take any? Barb Godin : Yeah. This is Barb again. We had no energy charge-offs this quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So as we think about the $50 million to $75 million of losses for the rest of the year, any additional granularity you can give around what segments you expect those losses to come from and timing of those losses? Barb Godin : Yeah. I would primarily see the losses coming from by and large the oilfield services segment. The E&P segment, we know our collateral is, it doesn\u2019t go bad on us, not like it\u2019s been and is in a truck that we have to worry about. And again these are customers that we\u2019ve worked with for a long time and so we\u2019re going to continue to work with those customers. Some of the oilfield services customers are getting pressure, getting squeezed as the E&P customers reduce their CapEx, reduce their cost structure. So that\u2019s really where it\u2019s coming from. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. And just secondly, I was wondering if you can give an update on credit trends you\u2019re seeing in the energy heavy markets, Texas, Houston, Louisiana? Barb Godin : In general, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing there, I\u2019ll start with Texas. Texas, in particular Houston is pretty well diversified. We\u2019ve got some information as to how all breaks out in the supplement as well for the four gulf states but we\u2019re seeing good things in Texas still, things aren\u2019t as robust as they were, but they\u2019re not doing badly. On the consumer front, we\u2019re really not seeing much. We\u2019re actually looking at all of our consumer portfolios and our customer assistance programs in particular to say, are any customers calling relative to being dislocated from their unemployment or having an issue because they\u2019re either in the energy sector or things such as restaurants and they go to a restaurant and the restaurant business is now down, because of people in the energy sector not going as often. We have seen virtually things are stable, since the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve had 39 customers across all of our states calling, saying that they\u2019re somehow tied to the energy sector and that they\u2019re looking for some customer assistance and this is primarily around the auto sector and again, that is up probably maybe 1% over what we would normally assume. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Good morning, guys. Maybe I can follow-up a little bit on the last question, Barb, you talked geographically, but I just wanted to ask a little bit of the question you said earlier about seeing [indiscernible] metals and mining and agriculture and putting some pressure on durable goods companies, can you just help us understand how big a portfolio that is and if we don\u2019t see a pickup in oil, are you expecting to actually see losses in some of these portfolios or is it more that you\u2019re seeing negative migration? Barb Godin : Thanks for the question. Firstly, in total, the metals and mining is about an $800 million portfolio with durable goods about $110 million and primarily metals just under $500 million, $480 million and we\u2019re seeing some pressure in terms of migration into other asset classes. And again that\u2019s tied, some of it to energy and as I think of customers who build specifically manufacture the pipeline, those customers clearly have reduced demand. Of course, you\u2019ve got the pressure because of the strong US dollar and the pressure of what\u2019s going on in places like China. So we do see more of that migrating over into the non-past weighted categories. Again, our sense around losses on that still comes back to our overall range of 25 to 35 basis points for the year and that would appropriate the use on that. Our ag portfolio is roughly $800 million as well, primarily in low crops and what we see there again is pressure on those commodities, again given what\u2019s going on globally. Ryan Nash : Got it. David, maybe I can ask a question on the non-interest income, if I look in the first quarter, you\u2019re growing at about 10% as a percent of a clip on an annual basis and I\u2019m just wondering given the fact how strong it\u2019s been and the fact that, you\u2019re now articulating service charges are likely going to be up for the year, given customer growth, could we actually see our non-interest income growing at the high end, or maybe even a little bit above again, just given the fact that you\u2019ve done acquisitions, the customer growth is coming in very strong, and there hasn\u2019t been -- there don\u2019t seem to be that many headwinds in terms of the fee income. David Turner : Yeah, I think, Ryan, that we have a shot at being at the high end of that. I\u2019ve cautioned you to extrapolate what you are seeing for the full year. I would like to say we could get above the 6%, but we are going to guide to the 4% to 6% right now, because there are certain things, capital market\u2019s revenues have a tendency to move around a bit, just depends on when transactions get closed. So you could see that move somewhat. Mortgage is susceptible to the rate environment as we see. We feel good and second, third quarters are always strong quarters in mortgage. So we feel good there, but you have things like - from a trust standpoint it continues a little bit on where the market goes. And of course we had the bank-owned life insurance, so I think we carved that out. That\u2019s not going to recur. So I think that we feel good about the investments that we made. We feel good about the performance of those investments, but we need \u2013 this is one quarter, we need to get few more under our belt before we can call it above the 6%. Ryan Nash : Got it. If I could just squeeze in one last quick one, if I look the capital payout was almost 100% this quarter, clearly the stock is trading at or below tangible book value, so I appreciate you wanting to be tactical, but can we continue to return capital at this kind of pace and as you think out over the next couple of quarters assuming if the stock continues to trade in this range, do you think we can get more aggressive from the 2015 CCAR level? David Turner : So we\u2019ve made our submission, we can\u2019t talk specifically about what\u2019s in it. But I think if you look at our capital where we are today from capital ratio standpoint, it was an expectation over time that we could expect to move our common equity tier 1 into that 9.5% range. The question is what pace will we have to get there. So if you just think about our payout being in the mid-90s last year and growing our loan portfolio 5%, let\u2019s just call that $4 billion for easy math, that\u2019s about 40 basis points of capital. So do what we are doing right now, we will continue get our capital ratio down and for us we want to make appropriate investments. We understand we trade below tangible book value. It is pretty good investment to buy your shares back which is why we\u2019ve been doing what we are doing and you should continue to expect that we have an appropriate return to our shareholders, although our focus really is to use our capital for organic growth. Our capital is to be used to expand our business to grow new revenue to make investments in technology and process improvements and of course pay an appropriate dividend to our shareholders. And then after that if there is excess capital and earnings and it\u2019s repurchasing share from our shareholder which is what we did last year and you should expect that same approach this year. Ryan Nash : Thanks for taking my questions and great quarter. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. You just covered my question. Thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Grayson Hall : Hi, Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, thank you for taking the question. On the capital markets business, can you give us a bit more color on what drove that doubling in revenues from last year, what the areas are, where you\u2019ve been making investments and how much you think you can continue to grow the business? David Turner : Geoffrey, so we made a number of investments over the past couple of years and the most recent one was our M&A advisory firm that we acquired in the fourth quarter last year. They really are just getting going, so they had a little bit of activity in the first quarter that was nice to see. We expect that business to continue to ramp up and grow over time. We had made investments to get a license under the Fannie Mae DUS program for placement of real estate loans and we had a good quarter there as well. Loan syndication, we have built that out a bit by hiring Stifel and that continued to benefit. So capital markets had a very good quarter and as I mentioned earlier is that that can move around on you from quarter to quarter, but what we see from those investments we are very encouraged. Grayson Hall : I mean, Jeff, that\u2019s a momentum business. We are very pleased with how they performed this quarter. We obviously feel like we invest a lot in people and product and technology in that space, but today this point, earnings in that business can move around from quarter-to-quarter. But we believe we are on a very positive trajectory and we are continuing to look for opportunities to make more investments in that part of our business. And so we anticipate over time of becoming more and more important to our franchise. Geoffrey Elliott : And thinking out longer term, what are the sort of capabilities that you might like to add to that business? David Turner : Well, I think what we are going to be careful of is not getting ahead of our sales too much. We have made quite a few investments in capital markets and really have brought on some very talented people, and I think our focus is to continue to execute and grow what we just discussed. I think the purpose of expanding our capital markets is for two primary reasons. One, we want to grow and diversify our revenue and this gives us a chance to grow non-interest revenue. But maybe the most important component of that is we want to be able to bring the entire Regions to our customer to be able to help our customer to succeed. So we have made investments in capabilities that we think can do that. We didn\u2019t have -- our capital markets business has been part of Morgan Keegan for a lot of years and when we disposed of that, we disposed the capital markets opportunity. So we are having to rebuild that and we made the investments to do it by acquiring the talent that we need to have and we want to be careful not to go too fast and like I said, we are encouraged by where we are. Grayson Hall : And just to be clear, our focus is on debt capital markets platform, David mentioned, Morgan Keegan. There are a number of things that we used to do that we don\u2019t aspire to do, but I would say that as we think about building our debt capital markets platform with a focus on meeting customer needs, other capabilities are fixed income, sales and trading. Today, we participate in fixed income underwritings. We would like to lead those opportunities. Just as our syndications revenue is growing. As we win more lead roles, we want to build \u2013 lead those fixed income underwrites as well, so that\u2019s one capability we don\u2019t have today, we will have hopefully in the near future. Low income housing tax credit is a really good business for us, we would like to have some syndication capabilities as we think about building out our origination and distribution model. And so we see a lot of upside in capital markets and debt capital markets revenue over time. But we will be thoughtful in that regard. We are trying to diversify our revenues across a lot spectrum of services for our customers. And to David\u2019s point, most important part is to build capability to service our customers. Geoffrey Elliott : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Good morning. I wanted to kind of go on the other side of the capital markets equation, which is as you saw the uptick in the revenues, typically that business has corresponding uptick in expenses, which would accentuate to drop that you saw this particular quarter. So just wanted to kind of see if there was any other way that you\u2019re approaching it or was that already embedded in the expense number we saw this quarter? Grayson Hall : Marty, what we saw along is we really are trying to focus on expense initiatives, so that not only can we improve the overall financial performance of the company and create positive operating leverage, but we also want to do it in a way that allows us to make investments we need to make in other parts of our business. And as David mentioned a moment ago, we had a substantial reduction in workforce over the last quarter. That\u2019s helped us mitigate a lot of the expense growth, but at the same time, make some of these investments. And I will ask John Turner to expand and get a little more color on capital markets and what the expenses there may hold. I would just say that recognizing that our primary investment is in people and people with significant skillset, so to your point there is cost associated with that. I think we are trying to be very thoughtful about the businesses that we enter and the returns that we get in this business making sure that while we are really compensating our associates, we are also earning a fair return for our shareholders as well and to Grayson\u2019s point, in order to make those investments, we\u2019ve got to reduce expenses elsewhere which we\u2019ve been successful doing thus far. Marty Mosby : David, when you said lower expenses associated with liabilities on employee benefits, was that the BOLI impact or was there something else maybe in the pension plan that you made adjustments to that you may have a sustainable benefit going forward and can you put a little number around that, if that is that? David Turner : So, Marty, if you go back, I mentioned the non-interest revenue income was down because truck related trading assets associated with certain of our benefit plans, offset to that was your \u2013 the expense you are talking about, so it\u2019s virtually a one for one. It\u2019s in the $10 million, $12 million range. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of KBW. Chris Mutascio : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David Turner : Thank you. Chris Mutascio : Hey, David, I\u2019ve just got some follow-up. I just want to clarify couple of things, make sure I have it right. The dollar amount of the, I won\u2019t call non-recurring, but the things you mentioned that benefitted net interest income in the quarter, was that the $5 million to $7 million I think when you are discussing the premium amortization or was it higher than that including the dividend income from the trading assets? David Turner : It\u2019s both. The 5% to 7% takes both of those. It\u2019s 4% to 5% on premium amortization, another 2% to 3% on the dividend. Chris Mutascio : Okay. I kind of backed into it. I think that was the total amount of the two when I looked at the margin. The second one, just to clarify, I think I had this right too. So you are resetting kind of bar if you will for second quarter for those on the margin, so instead of 3.19 maybe you are looking at adjusted 3.14, but any type of margin compression due to the lack of rising interest rates would be off of the resetting 3.14 number, not the 3.19 number? David Turner : That\u2019s correct. Chris Mutascio : Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you hear me now? Grayson Hall : Yeah. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Can you guys share with us what you are seeing in spreads on your corporate loan book or have they \u2013 some of the banks have reported that they seem to be stabilizing. Are you guys seeing that in the C&I portfolio or the commercial real estate mortgage portfolio? John Turner : Gerard, this is John Turner. We are seeing stabilization in pricing still very competitive market and I would say we are competing more on tenure and structure than we are on price. It has been nice to see some stabilization in pricing over the last quarter or two. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then in regards, I just want to go back, I think you guys mentioned about the special mention loans coming down as the energy portfolio has migrated to different classes, was the drop in special mention entirely energy or were there some others that cause that number to decline. Barb Godin : It\u2019s Barb again. Pretty broad based decline, in fact if you look at our delinquencies, 30-day delinquencies were down, 90-day delinquencies were down and action what we did in energy all of other credit metrics would be down as well including our reserve. We would not have built as much reserve, we may \u2013 we even had a small release had it not been for us providing for energy. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And were the actions you\u2019ve taken in energy this quarter as a result of the Shared National Credit exam as well as your own internal observations or what\u2019s going on with the portfolio? Barb Godin : As we mentioned, we did incorporate the Shared National Credit exam, but again looking at these credits on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, we are in constant contact with our customers. Our portfolio is very granular. Between oil field services and the E&P customers there is less than 80 customers in total, so we are staying in constant contact with them, working with them and real understanding of what\u2019s going on with them and that\u2019s one of the reason that we moved credits into various classifications as we\u2019ve got better information from them. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And just last question, I apologize if you have addressed this already. In terms of the loans that went into non-performing status, the energy loans, what percentage of those loans were part of syndicated credits were you were participant versus loans that you may have originated on your own? Barb Godin : That would be the majority of them. I don't have an exact percentage for you but it would be the majority of them. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Sterne Agee. Peter Winter : When I look at the balance sheet, it tends to be more levered to the long end of the curve then most of your peers. And with the tenure really coming down so much during the quarter, I\u2019m just wondering if the tenure were to move back up, would that help stabilize the margin. And then secondly, is there anything you can do in terms of like remixing the balance sheet to be a little bit more reliant on the shorter end of the curve? Grayson Hall : Well, so you\u2019re exactly right, if you look at our sensitivity, our sensitivity is more so to the back end to the long end than the short end. And as tenure does pick back up then you would see that manifests itself in two ways, one better reinvestment rates and two lower premium amortization. And we\u2019re forecasting our premium amortization to go up because of the reduction in the tenure but that can be short lived as you know pretty volatile and we\u2019re positioned exactly where want to be. It was intentional and we think it was the right thing to do for us. Peter Winter : And then just one quick follow-up. On the loan portfolio commercial real estate, the owner occupied that continuous to decline and I'm just wondering if there is light at the end of the tunnel where it starts to flatten out maybe you can get a little bit growth going forward? John Turner : Yes, I mean if you look at our loan portfolio, almost every category is now growing and the vast majority of the markets we operate in are showing that loan growth but the one lending segment that's been slow to demonstrate growth has been the only occupied space which is predominantly small to medium size businesses and a lot of that is in amortizing portfolio that\u2019s used to expand plant and equipment. We still not seen that small business owner return to the market with courage to invest and expand. We keep thinking, we\u2019ll reach a pivot point in that business. Production is remarkably strong in that part of the business over the last couple of quarters but you know outstanding on a net basis is still continues to decline. We still think our expectations are that it will pivot at some point but we still think we\u2019re ways away from that. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Harbes of Wells Fargo. Jason Harbes : Most of my questions has been answered but just wanted to follow up on the coverage ratio guidance, I think you guys gave back at the Investor Day, you said you know 120 to 140 basis points is about the right range this quarter pretty much the high end of the range with the energy-related reserve built. Just wanted to get a feel for it, is that still kind of the right way we should be thinking about in light of some of the makeshift with the greater focus on card and some of the other peer-to-peer lending activity. Barb Godin : And again 120 to 140 that we touched on back then you know that's just a general rule of thumb, you\u2019re going to see some of our peer companies still lower than that, some go higher than that. So there is more specific sweet spots that we\u2019re looking for regarding our process play out each quarter and if we did look at the higher end, a little over as 140 this time but again that will be different each quarter as we taken in all of the information that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Micenko of Susquehanna. Jack Micenko : Most of my questions have been answered but wanted to ask about auto, it's been a bright spot for the portfolio has grown nicely. Have you made any changes there around underwriting a product type with some of the concerns that are sort of cropped up at the lower end of the market? And then I guess secondly, do you think if SAAR is down something modestly make sure you can continue to grow that portfolio? John Turner : Well, I mean I think it's been a very good as you say, it's been a good growth market for us and if we\u2019ve shown some fairly good growth rates, albeit from a fairly low level of outstandings that we had in the balance sheet. It\u2019s a business we reentered a few years ago. We have continued to adjust our credit underwriting standards on that business overtime as we\u2019ve seen the market change. We tried to stay very rigorous and disciplined in that regard. We have modified some of our adjustments to try to reduce the duration of the portfolio. We\u2019ve made some adjustments that have tried to narrow the part of the market that we\u2019re willing to lend into.  I think that our actions have, to a certain degree for all of the amount of volume that we get, but volume that we\u2019re getting is of a quality that we feel good about and the performance that we see is strong. I just remind you that we only deal with preferred dealers, we don\u2019t anticipate in the subprime market, to any great extent, and we do not have any leasing products. So we feel, we\u2019re pretty plain and simple in how we approach the auto market and trying to stay disciplined in how we participate. I do think the latter part of your question is depending on what sales volumes are for that industry will clearly drive what opportunities we have for origination growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Jesus Bueno of Compass Point. Jesus Bueno : Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Very quickly, you touched on small business lending, do you have any update on the foundation partnership and perhaps how that did and now that you have one kind of full quarter of that and perhaps even expectations for this year? Grayson Hall : I would say it\u2019s still too early to call. We\u2019re pleased with the early results of that partnership. We\u2019ve not publicly released any of those performance metrics, but I would say that while we\u2019re pleased, it\u2019s still too early for us to make any sort of public announcement on where we think that\u2019s going and it\u2019s still relatively small contributor to our origination, you\u2019ll see us doing a number of these innovative partnerships. In aggregate, they should be very meaningful, but on an individual basis, they\u2019re all incremental. Jesus Bueno : Great. Thank you. And just again on the reserve build for energy this quarter, approximately how much of that, kind of 2% increase in the energy reserve was directly related to the results of that exam, would you say primarily the whole thing or was there a large portion of it? David Turner : Well, again, as Barb Godin had said earlier, we\u2019re not going to comment directly on that exam. What we\u2019ll tell you in general is that we use all input that we get, both internally and externally in talking to our customers and all of the input we\u2019ve gotten from all sorts and have been accounted for in how we reserve this quarter. Jesus Bueno : Fair enough. And I\u2019ll just slip one more in. On mortgages quickly, I guess the volumes were pretty solid this quarter and looked to be better than I guess what was anticipated, I guess how do you feel kind of in the first three weeks of the second quarter, I guess going into this quarter, how are your pipelines and I guess have you also had any lingering effects from trades still in the first quarter and anticipating that for the second quarter? Grayson Hall : Well, I would tell you, first quarter, we\u2019re very encouraged by how the fundamentals of the company are performing. We are seeing good solid results across almost all of our businesses, and almost all of our geographies and so if you look at the fundamentals of the company and how we performed, I think we think we had a good solid quarter. We do have some headwinds in the energy portfolio and metals and mining and we are addressing those in a very rigorous and disciplined manner, but on a net basis, we feel pretty good about it and we think that the fundamental performance that we\u2019re seeing in the first quarter should continue into the second quarter.  As we mentioned earlier, we have seen a softness in our sales pipelines in the first quarter, which should make second quarter a little more uncertain than we would like. But I would say that we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making. We don\u2019t think there has been any impact of TRID at this point in time and don\u2019t anticipate that in the second quarter, but continuing to make mortgage \u2013 continuing to make progress. And as David said earlier, if you look at our mortgage business in particular, second and third quarters always seasonally the best quarters we have of the year and so we do anticipate second quarter being better in that regard. Jesus Bueno : Great. Appreciate the color. Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my questions. Grayson Hall : Thank you. David Turner : Thank you. Grayson Hall : I believe we have more questions. Operator : We have one more question. Your final question comes from Jill Shea of Credit Suisse. Jill Shea : Good morning. Just on the deposit service fees, I mean, held up quite well in the quarter just given the seasonality and the full quarter impact of the posting order changes. Can you just talk about the underlying account growth momentum you\u2019re seeing and sort of how that ties into the outlook for fee growth going forward? David Turner : So as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we actually had grown checking accounts last year about 2%, we have grown checking accounts this year, and we have our full quarter service charges from the posting order impact that started November last year, so we kind of got a mid-quarter last quarter, full quarter this quarter, we think we are off to seeing service charges increase modestly as we go throughout 2016. A big driver of that is our ability to grow customer accounts, both last year and this year. Grayson Hall : Jill, I would tell you that the account growth has been very steady and very solid and broad across our franchise footprint. Really encouraging is that consumers continue to build liquidity. We are seeing very strong liquidity metrics on the consumer side. And we are also seeing the number of active cards, both debit cards and credit cards, number of active cards are up as well as the number of transactions for cards are up. I would comment that credit card balances are up modestly, it\u2019s usually the seasonal time of the year, but we saw average credit balances up 2% to 3%. We are probably up 8% year-over-year. But that\u2019s in the face of strong double-digit transaction activity on cards. But customers are being fiscally conservative and we are not seeing balances go up remarkably, but we are seeing go up modestly. But transaction activity is very strong and so we are encouraged. Jill Shea : Great, thanks. Grayson Hall : Well, if that\u2019s a last question, we appreciate everyone attending our call today. We thank you for your time and attention. And we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward looking statements during today's call that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to defer materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic backdrop. For the second quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $259 million and earnings per share of $0.20. We continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth. We expanded our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth relationships. Our approach to relationship banking and customer service is excellence is instrumental to our success and we are always pleased to receive external recognition in these efforts. In that regard the Reputation Institute and The American Banker magazine recently ranked Regions as the most reputable U.S. bank overall and for the second consecutive year, the most reputable among customers. We are honored to again receive this top ranking as it recognized the efforts from all Regions associates in identifying and meeting the needs of our customers and communities we serve. Another outstanding recognition came from Temkin Group which ranked Regions among the top 10% of companies they rated in 2016 as we ranked second in the nation for online experience. Looking further at our results we achieved total average loan growth of 4% compared to the prior year, despite market uncertainty the overall health of the consumer remains a bright spot. To that end consumer loans increased 5% year-over-year with loan balances up in every asset category and our consumer credit metrics continue to improve. Consumer net charge offs decreased [ph] 5% from the second quarter last year, non-accrual consumer loans decreased 16%, delinquencies decreased 5% and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4%, active credit cards increased 12% year-over-year, all active debit cards increased 4%. Total transactions owned cards increased 6% and total spend is up 5%. Further average consumer deposits were up 3% year-over-year including savings deposits were up 9%. Turning to business lending, average loans increased 3% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter we are experiencing some softness in our commercial lending pipelines, still strong but soft. In some areas customer sentiment continues to reflect less optimism and more uncertainty in the economy and we have yet to see small business owners really return to market with confidence to invest and expand. We are also exercising caution and discipline as we approach internal concentration risk lending limits with certain segments and certain geographies and as we highlighted recently at Investor Day we continue to strengthen our loan portfolio in our focus on migrating credit only relationships recycling that capital into more profitable and deeper relationship that resulted in better portfolio overall. As a result, and as previously disclosed we expect to attract towards the lower end on a 3% to 5% average loan growth for 2016. Despite softer business loan demand total adjusted revenue increased 4% over the second quarter of 2015 reflecting the effective execution of our strategic plan to grow and diversify our revenue. Our investments are clearly paying off as capital markets increased 41% and wealth management increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. With respect to market conditions, the global and macroeconomic environment does remain challenging as such it's critical in this operating environment that we focus on what we can control. To that end we remain committed and focused on discipline, expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. For the first six months of 2016 our adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.3% and we have generated 4% positive operating leverage on adjusted basis. With respect to energy lending, while our oil -- oil prices have improved, lower prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefitting others. On a point-to-point basis our directly energy loans have declined $324 million, are 12% from the first quarter and currently stand at $2.4 billion or 2.9% of total loans. Additionally, we continue to maintain appropriate energy reserves which now stand at 9.4% of our direct energy exposure, up from 8% last quarter. The percentage increase is primarily due to the decline in direct energy loan balances. Further, we are substantially complete with our spring redetermination which as to date resulted in a 22% decline in customer borrowing bases. Turning to capital deployment, we successfully completed the annual comprehensive capital analysis interview process or CCAR and received no objection to our planned capital actions. As in last week, our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 on common shares and $640 million share repurchase plan. We remain committed as a team to deploying our capital effectively through organic growth and strategic initiatives that increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses while returning an appropriate amount of capital generated to our shareholders. In closing, our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities and our continued commitment to our three primary initiatives which are rolling and diversifying our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to our success and we remain on track to deliver our performance target. With that I will turn it over to David who will cover the details for the second quarter. David Turner : Thank you and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 20%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of $303 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending and balances increased $162 million linked quarter reflecting a 49% seasonal increase in production. Indirect auto lending increased $93 million and production increased 4% during the quarter as we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network. Other indirect lending which includes point-of-sale initiatives increased $87 million linked quarter or 15%. Turning to the credit card portfolio, average balances increased $16 million from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 17.7%, an improvement of 20 basis points. Total home equity balances decreased $87 million from the previous quarter as the pace of runoff exceeded production. As Grayson mentioned, we continue to experience softer pipelines in the commercial space. As a result total business lending average balances were relatively stable with the previous quarter. Average commercial loans grew $178 million linked quarter inclusive of a $64 million decline in average direct energy loans. The net increase in average commercial loans was driven by corporate banking as our specialized industry segments added new relationships within technology and defense and financial services and commitments in line utilization were relatively flat with previous quarter. Let's take look at deposits, total average deposit balances decreased $253 million from the previous quarter. Deposit costs remained near historically low levels at 12 basis points reflecting the strength of our deposit base and total funding cost continued to remain low, totaling 29 basis points in the second quarter. With respect to deposits, loan growth expectations provided the opportunity to accelerate our planned reduction of certain deposits within our wealth management and corporate segments which contributed to the overall decline in deposit balances. Within wealth management certain trust customer deposits which require collateralization by securities were moved into other fee income producing customer investments. Average deposits in the consumer segment increased $1.2 billion or 2% from the previous quarter reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low cost deposits. Our liquidity position remains solid with the historically low loan to deposit ratio of 84%. Let's see how this all impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on our fully taxable basis was $869 million, decreasing 2% from the first quarter but up 4% compared to the prior year. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%. As you recall the first quarter benefited from items that were not expected to repeat which partially contributed to the linked quarter declines in net interest income and other financing income as well as the net interest margin. Recent long term debt issuances, lower loan fees and less favorable credit related interest recoveries along with reduced dividends from training assets that benefited the first quarter were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter decrease. Now these were partially offset by higher loan balances. Noninterest income growth was strong in the second quarter reflecting our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify noninterest revenue. Total noninterest income increased 2% on an adjusted basis from the first quarter driven by growth in service charges, mortgage income and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased 4% in the second quarter reflecting the benefit of 2% growth year-to-date in checking accounts again, highlighting the strength of our retail franchise. Mortgage income increased 21% driven by a seasonal increase in production. Of note within total mortgage production 75% related to purchase activity and 25% related to refinancing. Additionally, during the quarter we entered into an agreement to purchase mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis. As a result we expect the purchase to rights [ph] to service approximately $40 million to $50 million of mortgage loans per month on a go forward basis. Card and ATM income increased 4% during the quarter driven by 1% increase in active debit cards and an 8% increase in transaction volume. We had another good quarter in capital markets with increased fees from merger and acquisition advisory services. Linked quarter results declined 7% relative to the prior quarters strong results, the decline was primarily due to reductions in fees generated from the placement, the permanent financing for real estate customers and syndicated loan transactions which were especially strong in the first quarter. Wealth management income decreased 3% primarily due to seasonal decreases in insurance income. This decrease was partially offset by increased investment management [indiscernible] fees. Importantly despite our reduction in the wealth managements deposits total assets under administration increased 2% quarter-over-quarter. Noninterest income was also impacted by market value adjustments related to assets held for certain employee benefits which increased $20 million compared to the first quarter, however this has offset salaries and benefits with no impact to pretax income. Bank owned life insurance decreased this quarter primarily due to $14 million in claims benefits and a gain from an exchange of policies recognized in the first quarter. Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis expenses totaled $889 million representing a 5.5% increase quarter over quarter. During the second quarter of 2016 we incurred $22 million of property related expenses in connection with the consolidation of approximately 60 branches as well as other occupancy optimization initiatives. These branches are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including these 60 branches Regions has announced the consolidation of approximately 90 branches as part of the company's previously disclosed plans to consolidate 100 to 150 branches through 2018 and we continue to expect to be at the higher end of the range. Total salaries and benefits increased $5 million from the first quarter and as previously noted includes $20 million in additional expense related to market value adjustments associated with asset held for certain employee benefits which are offset in other noninterest income as I mentioned. In addition, severance related expenses declined by $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of the market value adjustments and severance charges, total salaries and benefits would have declined compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date staffing levels have declined 4% serving to lower base salaries and fully offset the impact of the annual merit increase. Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to $3 million in lieu and regulatory charges incurred during the second quarter related to the pending settlement of previously disclosed matters, as well as the impact of the $7 million favorable legal settlement recognized in the first quarter. FDIC insurance assessments decreased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a $6 million refund related to overpayments in prior periods. As previously disclosed we expect FDIC insurance assessments to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis associated with the FDIC surcharge, and we anticipate this will be implemented in the third quarter resulting in a quarterly FDIC run rate in the $27 million to $30 million range. Other expenses increased $25 million including an $11 million increase to the company's reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $9 million of credit related charges associated with other real estate and held for sale loans. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64% in the second quarter and 62.3% year-to-date. As Grayson mentioned in this uncertain market environment we are focused on what we can control and to that end disciplined expense management is paramount. Our plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses through 2018 is well underway. We're also evaluating opportunities to pull forward some of the identified savings as well as challenging our team to thoughtfully identify additional expense eliminations beyond the $300 million previously announced. Let's move onto asset quality. Total net charge offs increased $4 million to $72 million and represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan loss essentially matched charge offs in the quarter and our allowance for loan loss as a percent of total loans remains unchanged at 1.41%. Total non-accrual loans excluding loans held for sale increased 3% from the first quarter and troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs increased 4%. Total business services criticized loans increased 1%. These increase reflect global market uncertainty and a strength of the U.S. Dollar along with continued volatility in commodity prices. At quarter end of our loan loss allowance to non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 112%. We continue to see credit improvement within the consumer portfolio as net charge offs decreased 24% from the prior quarter. Additionally, consumer TERs improved link quarter while total delinquencies remained relatively stable. Within business services, we experienced $17 million worth of net charge offs within the energy portfolio during the quarter. Approximately half were attributable to Oil & Gas and half were attributable to coal. While oil prices have recently traded around $50 per barrel and are showing signs of stabilization, uncertainty remains. Should prices fall and consistently trade in the $35 to $45 range we expect additional losses between $50 million and $75 million. However, the time frame for these losses now extend through 2017 as we expect resolution will take longer for certain customers in the portfolio. And should oil prices average below the $25 per barrel through the end of 2017 we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture continues to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. We also continue to monitor investor real estate in energy related markets. We continue to believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in these portfolios. Now given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected especially if related to larger dollar commercial credits. Let\u2019s move on to Capital and Liquidity. During the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders including the repurchase of $179 million of common stock and $79 million in dividends completing our 2015 CCAR capital plan. As Grayson mentioned, we successfully completed our 2016 CCAR process and received no objection to our planned capital actions. And last week our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 quarterly dividend on common shares and a $620 million share repurchase plan and under Basel III the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7% well above current regulatory minimums. So let me provide you an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 3% to 5% on an average basis relative to the fourth quarter of 2015 and given current softer pipelines in the commercial space, we expect to track towards the lower end of that range. Regarding deposits, softer loan growth expectations coupled with a strategic reduction of certain deposits within our wealth management corporate banking segments will result in total average deposits remaining relatively stable with fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged, assuming no rate increases for the remainder of the 2016, we expect to be at the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range. As result of our investments, we continue to expect to grow adjusted non-interest income in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis and given our year-to-date performance we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is on track and we continue to expect to achieve 35% to 45% in 2016. Therefore total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We also expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 63% and adjusted positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016. Full year net charge-offs should be in the 25 to 35 basis point range and given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we continue to expect to be at the top end of that range. So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and we believe our results demonstrate that we're effectively executing our strategic plan in the context of a difficult operating environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to build sustainable franchised value. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A session of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up in order to accommodate as many participants as possible. We will now open the lines for question. Operator : This floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : I want to ask a question about the other expenses, not that they were unusual but there was some credit related to the unfunded commitment as well as some other credit related expenses, I looked about $20 million higher than a run rate, just wondered if that was something that elevated that this particular quarter? David Turner : Yes, Marty, this is David. So from the time-to-time, we'll have some credits that go sideways on us, this particular quarter we had really one large credit in the unfunded commitment that caused $11 million increase there and the charge for that we run through non-interest expense, and you'll see over quarters the volatility that can have, pluses and minuses, we expected that credit would fund in the third quarter, but believed it was important for us to continue to have an unfunded reserve for that today. From an Oreo and Health for sales [ph] standpoint again just a couple of credits that happen to be large and we had some write-downs that we believed needed to take place, so we kept valuation adjustments in total of that $9 million. So you're spot on, between the two there was about $20 million of charge that we had to take during the quarter. Marty Mosby : But thinking about that and then your tangible book value grows, been created by the 2% or better consistent growth. You know as you're looking premium shareholder value, one of the things that's probably -- what you've been able to de-risk because of just getting credit for the tangible book value growth would be an upward momentum for the overall valuation. So just wanted to see if as you think about where you're at today versus where you were at as it went in the last downturn, what makes Regions different from just a risk profile, so significant changes it\u2019s been able to address that should at least make investors comfortable with tangible book value. David Turner : Sure, so I mean we\u2019ve -- over the past six years we've made a lot of changes and people and process, content of our whole balance sheet has changed dramatically. The most obvious one is the decline in investor real estate which represented almost 30% of our loan portfolio at one time. Today it's about at, call it 9% -- right at 9%. The credit discipline that we have with regards to how we approach business is very different and you know we feel good, we have our hands around our loan portfolio, energy has been a challenge for our industry and those of us that participate in it, but our concentration risk management program that we have in place has reduced the impact -- negative impact we've otherwise have had. Being the largest bank headquarters in the Gulf State we have now about 3% of our loan portfolio in energy and we've talked about the reserves, the 9.4% reserves so we believe we have that covered. There's some volatility and uncertainty there, we feel like we're on top of that. As we think about our commitment to continue to grow our cash flow, our PP&R, look at the investments that we've made over time, those investments are paying off as we continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream and we've had a fairly consistent margin if you look at that. And then I'll wrap up with expense management. We have a $300 million target out there, where we said we'd take 35% to 45% of that in the first year, we're on track with where we want to be and I gave you guidance as to where we thought we'd finish the year. So it's very different regions and a very different approach to business and the stability of growth in tangible book value. We've been leveraging our earnings well and returning mid 90% of our capital back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend around 30% of that earnings and you know 60 plus percent in terms of share buyback. So we think we're deploying our capital effectively. So good business, good markets, good customers and executing against the strategic plan that we laid out in October for our board and at investor day. Marty Mosby : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Jennifer Demba : Question on your capital markets revenue, what do you think the potential is for this feed line over the next two to three years it's been growing at a rapid pace for a few quarters now? Grayson Hall : Yes, I mean as David mentioned earlier we continue to see some softness in our wholesale sales pipeline and if you look strategically what we try to do with that business is to build out a lot of the product offerings we have primarily in capital markets and also in treasury management. So that we can generate a very reasonable return on invested capital in that business and the capital markets group is a place that we've made significant investments, we continue to believe that those have been thoughtful and smart investments, we have demonstrated a very strong growth this year, we continue to challenge the team and in terms of what the growth capabilities are of that activity. We're coming from a relatively low base so the percentage is remarkably high, but we have not publicly stated a percentage increase goal, but we do believe strongly and confidently that that\u2019s a business that we can continue to grow overtime at an above rate level to other parts of our business. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : When I look at the criticized loan balances you're giving overall on Page 8, I see an increase and then when I look at Page 12, just specifically the energy balances I see a decrease. So I wondered if you could elaborate on what's driving the increase outside of energy. Barbara Godin : Yes, this is Barbara Godin. Energy as you said did go down, we saw some other movements as we look at some of the other areas that we have considered to be a little soft that would be agriculture, some transportation and primary metals. So, we're keeping an eye on that, we're being very cautious. In those categories we're watching them and as we see signs that there is any deterioration, we\u2019re immediately [ph] moving it into a special mention category and so that's -- that accounts for the increase there. Geoffrey Elliott : And just a quick follow-up, I didn't catch earlier, but I think you said the non-interest income growth you thought should be at the higher end of the 4% to 6% range? I just wanted to check I heard that right. David Turner : That's right, just taking kind of where we are today and looking at the investments we've made and what\u2019s in the pipeline, we feel that we will most likely be at the higher end of that, we'll give you a better guidance one more quarter out, but we feel confident to be able to lean towards the higher end of the range. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : David maybe a question to you, just following up on your comments about $300 million cost reduction in the 35% to 40% specifically you're targeting for this year, is it reasonable to assume that the pace of that 35% to 40% reduction will be largely back end loaded or could it be perhaps a bit more evenly spaced over the course of this year? David Turner : Well, you can have -- we haven\u2019t placed it in any given quarter, we really are trying to guide more to the full year than any given quarter. You can have at times spikes in expense from one quarter to the next, but we'd rather just stick with the guidance for the full year than -- more expensively [ph] -- flat modestly from 2015. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just on the, what sounds like a little bit of softness in the commercial pipelines particularly in CNI are there, outside of energy are there specific industries where you are seeing particular softness or is it more of a broad based greater level of caution on your borrowers part given economic uncertainty? Grayson Hall : I think where we try to compete is in the lower end of the commercial market and you are seeing a lot of our competitor demonstrate growth, a lot of that growth has been in the higher end of commercial into the corporate space. But, when you look at that middle market CNI customer we are seeing a lower level of demand for lending to support capital spending. I would tell you that in energies, is an obvious place where that has occurred, but you do see it, you do see that spread across a number of different commercial industries as there has been obviously a strengthening of the U.S. dollar and some uncertainty created by a lot of events, both globally and domestically. So I wouldn't say it's limited to one particular industry it seems to be more broad based than that. But yes, if you look at credit quality, commercial is still very good. We've had a really good experience now for several quarters in a row. We still expect it to be good, but it's modestly slow, modestly weaker than what we saw a quarter ago and at the same time we\u2019re just not seeing the new and renewed production that we were seeing this time last year. Matt Burnell : Okay. That's helpful. And David may be just another quick one for you, in terms of the bank-owned life insurance numbers, you mentioned one of the -- couple of reasons why that had moved around over the last couple of quarters. Guess I\u2019m just trying to get level set on what a reasonable run rate would be for the second half of the year. David Turner : Yes, so the first quarter did benefit from a couple of things. We exchanged the policy into the different product and we always had a plan. Where we are right now is about where you ought to expect that for the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : On net interest income, wanted to just understand, you got the purpose full decline in the whole sale balances, so the balance sheet looks to have shrunk and with the offset being a little bit better NIM. Can you just walk us through how you kind of expect that trade off to go going forward? Do we see not as much growth in earning assets but a lesser decline in the NIM in terms of growing NII? David Turner : Certainly, from a NIM standpoint we are really trying to growth NII, but NIM will be continued pressure at this rate environment stays where it is and I would expect you can have four to six more points of compressions for the remainder of the year. But as we think about growing NII, we do it from a couple of different spots, one growing earnings assets which is really on the funding side, deposit side and then putting those that growth into -- in good solid loan growth where we can get compensated for the risk that we are taking, where we can get compensated for having a full customer relationship versus just renting out the balance sheet from a credibility standpoint. It\u2019s very hard to make money if you're just making loans only. So, we're challenging our teams where we have relationship that\u2019s a credit only relationship to figure out how we recycle that capital into a more fulsome relationship with a customer. So, just because we don't have the loan growth doesn't mean we can't continue to grow NII if we execute that program appropriately. So that's kind of how we think about NII going forward. Ken Usdin : Yeah, and Dave. Go ahead Grayson I am sorry. Grayson Hall : I would just reiterate, we continue to see solid loan growth opportunities on the consumer side of our balance sheet and we expect that to continue, we don\u2019t see a reason at this point in time to not believe that continues and the health of that consumer customers continue to be remarkably strong. Now on the wholesale side, our focus continues to be in the lower end of that commercial middle markets space and we're trying to be much more regress, much more thoughtful and certainly more disciplined at this point in the credit cycle to make sure that what we're putting on our balance sheet make sense, that it has a reasonable return and a full relationship as David said. Ken Usdin : And my just one follow-up on that David, so you're getting to 3% year-over-year NII growth, It\u2019s almost basked in the cake even if you don't grow it sequentially from here, but are you confident though that you still can envision an x-rates growth in NII from the second quarter point? David Turner : Again we've landed on 3% for the full year and we're working hard to take where we're right now to continue to grow. It's obviously very challenging given the rate environment, what\u2019s rolling off versus what's going on flattening of the yield curve. So we have some reinvestment risks with regards to the securities portfolio, but we think if we will execute, we can continue to have some modest growth in NII and again we believe strongly in the 3% growth for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS. David Eads : Maybe just following up on the last point about the reinvestment risks in AFS [ph] portfolio with the tenure where it is, is there any change to your -- how come you're basically just looking to replay maturities and pay downs at current prices or anything you would look to change on that perspective? David Turner : We don't have any major change anticipated. We haven't extended integration [ph] in little over three year right now. It's been that way for a while. We don't look to make that change. We have a risk profile in the securities book like we want it to be, so we haven't look for a lot of wholesale changes from basically the mortgage backs that we have there today. So as you're pointing currently the risks versus that reinvestment yield going as tenure continues to have pressure on us, we will put pressure on our return on the securities book, but we don't believe the risk of trying to change that dramatically is worth it to us right now. So you've kind of answered I think your own question. David Eads : Right, that makes perfect sense and maybe on a related point, it's a good quarter from mortgage revenues and you guys have made a point that it was mostly purchase related, do you have expectations for how that business is going to shape out over the next couple of quarters and whether it gets a little bit more refi heavy and whether I guess revenues can kind of stay in your -- stay high, nearly seasonally high levels for a couple of quarters? Grayson Hall : I think that we were pleased with the performance of our mortgage claim this quarter, again the mix of business that we placed on the books this quarter about 75% repurchased in about 25% refinanced -- purchased and refinanced. We do expect to have a good third quarter based off what we're seeing today. We have seen a shift in the application volume. I would tell you that instead of being about 75-25 it appears to be shifting more 60-40 in terms of purchase versus refinance, so we should see that shift in this quarter, but think we'll have a good quarter. Traditionally if you look at our numbers, second and third quarter are always our strongest mortgage origination quarters. So absent any change that we don't see today we think we outta have good progress going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : I had a question for you on the previously announced relationship with Avant and where that's at and if there is any changes given kind of their volume cuts and their business or what that's going to look like for you guys moving forward. David Turner : Yes, so you know Avant is still in the early stages, we'll launch that in August. So it's premature for us to comment, we think it can be accretive to us over time, but the way we're treating some of these investments that we're making is, we're not taking a lot of risk, we're trying some things, we're seeing what we can learn, we're seeing how we can better serve our existing customer base with these opportunities so we think it'll work for us, but you know again too early to tell, we'll update you as we go through the third quarter and into the fourth. Grayson Hall : I mean we've been getting a good feedback from our customers on our own line experience and you know we mentioned earlier in the call we've gotten some recent recognition in that regard and ironically we're in the process even as we speak refreshing our own line and mobile experiences for our customers. We're launching that as we speak and then Avant will be in August as David said. We think it's just one more way of trying to provide a better experience for our customers in both the online and mobile channels, but it'll be incremental to what we're doing. Good consumer numbers, I think we were extremely pleased overall with consumer numbers this quarter across all channels, one of the better quarters we've had. Stephen Scouten : Sounds good, and I guess maybe as a follow up do you have any trepidation on either you know from the standpoint of giving away customer data or losing customer contact in a relationship such as this and also just you mentioned the growth in consumer as a whole, any trepidation there in terms of increasing that exposure and what ultimate losses could be on the consumer side even as I know credit metrics on the consumer side have been good here as of late. Grayson Hall : I mean well, first of all foundation of our business is built off customer trust, without customer trust our business model doesn't work and so we are very sensitive to anything we do that involves customer data and the privacy of that data, the confidentiality protection of that data. So we have very extensive risk management reviews, our due diligence process is very rigorous and will continue to be. That being said cyber security is an area that we're all challenged with today, but spending an awful lot of resource and time on it, but there's nothing more important to us than the trust of our customers, with their information and their assets. Operator : Your next question will come from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Michael Rose : David just one for you, just going back to energy right at this scenario if oil was $35 to $45, but what if we\u2019re tracking above that into the back half of the year, what would that imply for total losses and maybe any updated commentary into '17? David Turner : So, we have as you now see reserves of about 9.4%, those reserves are established based in large part due to the risk ratings we assign, they come from our work and our credit team\u2019s work and also evaluated by our regulatory supervisors. In terms of what ultimate losses are? We'll have to see if we continue to get stabilization in higher oil price than that reduces are pressure and risk of ultimate charge offs, but I would say that given the volatility that we see in the prices it'd be premature to see how those reserves would come back into income in the short term. I think we need to let that play out over a little longer period of time. Barbara Godin : This is Barbara, I will say Michael that with oil even at $50 or higher a barrel, that certainly helps the E&P companies first, but the oil field services company they can't delay, so again the reason for us putting out the 50 to 75 between now against next year. Michael Rose : And maybe just a quick follow-up, the reason that's charged off this quarter, obviously I understand the volatility with oil and the lack of service companies, but is the way to think about that is the provision should match pretty closely to charge offs moving forward? David Turner : We have a process that we go through, [indiscernible] anything unusual that's a pretty good yes, that being said as credit continues to improve across the board and risk ratings change then you don't have to provide for those losses and that would be the indicator of where the provision could be less in charge offs. We need to let our model run and trying to forecast that out is probably not the best thing for us to do. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : You had two of your peers give guidance on dollar expenses beyond '16, in fact going out all way out to 2018, in a bid to tell investors that they can support efficiency gains without rates and I'm wondering if we think about 2017, you're guiding that we should enter the year with a base -- a natural expense base of let's say 3.45 billion and I'm wondering if how you're thinking about some of the cost savings that you've already identified to go into that 2017 number and whether they can overwhelm some of the investments, in other words is there room to cut that 3.45 billion number to support efficiency if we don't get the help from the rate environment? David Turner : So Erika it\u2019s a good question, I tried to address a little bit of that in the prepared comments. When we -- so we have the $300 million expense elimination program, we're on track with that, we're really are challenging ourselves, if you think of a couple of a things, one, how do we -- some of those savings actually through our model started 2018 and so the question is what can we do that\u2019s prudent, makes sense to move into 2017? That'll take some work, we'll come back as we get later in the year and start giving you a little better guidance of the '17, we'll give you an update on that. The second would be, there's a -- we have a lot of rationale that went around the $300 million, it was roughly 9% of our expense base. But we're going to go back and challenge ourselves to think through how we might change that over time. Again we need to be very thoughtful, we need to make sure we don't benefit the short term at the expense of the long term. The franchise building that we are trying to do. We want sustainable franchise value, we don't want just short term. So its get trickier as we start thinking in these terms, but we believe rates, you have to have the mindset that rates are going to be lower for longer and this is something we can't control. So, we have more work to do here and we\u2019re look forward to the challenge. Grayson Hall : We have been in this environment for a good long while and we've learned how to manage through it. We've had to really defend our margin, defend the credit culture that we're trying to build in terms of how we grow and build our loan portfolio and managing expenses in this lower for longer environment has just got to be a skill set that we continue to exercise and deploy. We've been very aggressive on branch consolidations, we think we know how to do that and do it well. But, I think that as David said is that in a lower than longer forecast and we have to go back and just continue to re-challenge ourselves and redefine how we manage through this for a longer period of time. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And I just have a follow up question to Barb. You mentioned something about how energy prices impacts different parts of your energy portfolio from a different timing perspective. And the question really here is investors are starting to wonder, what type of oil price level do we need to see to see that 9.4 reserve ratio start getting released or going down, appreciating that this reserve is built on a loan by loan basis. But is there any external factor that we can look to say, okay, that's now done and we can now expect to release some of those reserves into the rest of the book? Barbara Godin : Yes Erika, I think you hit the nail on the head relative to the reserve, it\u2019s made up of different groupings. Of course E&P as I said will benefit from higher oil prices where we see them in the $60 to $70 a barrel range that's great for the E&P Company, but again even at that level oil field services companies will continue to be challenged, it takes them longer to restructure and get back on their feet. So again, the extended tail on the oil field services and as we think of our provisions roughly two-thirds of our provision right now is established against the oil field services sub sector in our book. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Regarding the loan growth, on the commercial side I know you indicated some of the weakening of the pipeline but also some of the intentional pull back in the single relationship credit. How would you split that up in terms of the impact on second quarter and the period loan growth from the commercial side? How much of that weaker than expected or how much of that weakness should we say came from the intentional pull back versus the softening demand? Grayson Hall : That\u2019s a great question, it\u2019s one we've spent some time ourselves internally sort of discussing and debating and clearly part of the weakness we're seeing is just general market demand for credit and if you look at top of company and domestic U.S. numbers the level of fixed capital spending by wholesale customers continues to be below historical proportions and we're seeing net end demand for credit, but at the same time you also hear us talking about making sure that we got full relationships and we are getting paid a reasonable return for providing banking services to our clients. So we need a full relationship to do that. The return on the credit only relationship is just not sufficient, but we also have been very disciplined in making sure that we have diversity in our balance sheet and so there are certain asset categories that our risk appetite is full filled on and so we've been more judicious about not adding more of that product type to our balance sheet and we're absolutely committed to staying diversified. I think if you look at it today, we would say it's about half and half, about half of it\u2019s the market and about half of it is disciplined that we're invoking. I'd also remind you that when you look at our loan growth for this quarter, keep in mind the reduction in energy loans that we've achieved over the past quarter then it's been a -- there is a story there that without that reduction in energy growth in our wholesale book would have been much stronger. John Pancari : Okay that\u2019s helpful and then real quick Barb on credit, did you say that both the criticized balance increases as well as the NPA increase were attributable to the other areas that you sited agricultural metals and transportation? Barbara Godin : No, NPA was primarily an energy story, [indiscernible] the other groups that I talked about. John Pancari : Okay got it and then lastly in terms of the margin impact of putting on less of the more thinly price relationships that are single relationships type of credits that you're deemphasizing, just trying to put a number around it or in terms of yield, what yields are some of those loans running off that you're deemphasizing as a single relationship and then how's that compared to new production yield on what you are putting on your book? David Turner : Well it really just depends John in terms different products. On the C&I space, we haven't seen spreads changed dramatically there, but if you are 225 over you're working against yourself that portfolio yielding yields today about 3.5%, and so as we think about how to combat some of this, wanted to get deeper relationship, we're not often having to look just at spread because the spread is only a component part of the income we get from the customer basis. The other is NII sources that helped rounded out. So it's in fact we had a lower spread asset we look for relationship, we can do with that, it's having a low spread without the relationship that\u2019s the problem. So I think that also how to combat this would be the consumer growth, we grew consumer loans about $300 million, we've had nice production in consumer where we're getting paid for that risk and that's helping to combat the downward pressure on loan yields. So our loan yields from the first quarter we\u2019re only down 2 basis points, that\u2019s the mixed shift and remixing of business that we're trying to make in our total balance sheet to be more profitable to get better return to our shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR and Company. Paul Miller : Thank you very much, most of my questions are answered, but I do have one on non-interest income. You gave a I think range of 5% growth there and over the last year most of your growth has come from either card and ATM fees, or capital markets. Is that what we should be modeling in, is that what most of the growth's going to come from or is there some categories that you've been investing and you should start seeing some growth there. David Turner : If you look at that we've made lots of investments in capital markets you see in the growth there, but also in terms of service charges and credit card, ATM card kind of growth, all that's really coming from poor consumer household growth [ph]. We're seeing better consumer growth across the communities we serve, more broadly than we've seen in the past. We really are pleased with the progress we've made in the customer experience in our consumer business and the results really are starting to come through and we think that that continues to be a good story. Additionally, we've made several investments in our wealth management offerings, you know wealth management had a good quarter this quarter, we think that continues and has the prospect of even improving. So you know overall very good story this quarter. Paul Miller : And you're saying, where do you see most of the growth. I know you've invested in Florida pretty heavily over the years, is it coming across your geographic footprint or is it coming in certain states? David Turner : It's more broad than it\u2019s been in the past and you know you're correct and historically we had a very strong growth out in the state of Florida, that -- Florida continues to be a very critical market for our franchise, but growth is much more broad than it's ever been historically in the company that's been purposeful on our part, we very much try to make sure that we're not only diversifying our business by product but we're diversifying it by geography and we've made very conscious investments to improve the production of our consumer and our wealth management business as well as wholesale across all the communities that we serve. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Conner at Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Conner: Any update on the CRA downgrade from earlier this year in terms of what you're doing to remediate that and if there's any impact that's having on kind of day-to-day operations [indiscernible]? David Turner : Yes, Matt it's David, so you know we have to go back to kind of the exam that we had the results our core CRA program continues to be robust, we have a lot of assessment areas specially relative to anybody else in the country and we do a good job, our team is really committed to the customers and communities that we serve and we feel like we're doing a pretty good job there. We did have an issue that was outstanding from another regulatory fee was considered and so we're going through, we had to go through another exam cycle for that to get cleared up, the timing of which is completely dependent on our regulatory supervisors and we believe we've done everything we need to continue to work through this and we hope that the conclusion is favorable when that is concluded upon by our regulatory supervisors. Matt O'Conner: And then just separately if you look at the indirect consumer bucket I think which includes the POS loans the $600 million to $700 million of loans, you've had good growth there, it seems like there's kind of the typical beginning of the seasoning of that portfolio from a credit quality perspective, obviously very small numbers, but do you have a sense of what losses in that book may get to? It's a good yielding book and you've been growing it a lot. Grayson Hall : I mean that, we look at the indirect portfolio we\u2019ve been growing it quite steadily, starting off from a relatively small base, we've been very selective on where we participate in that market, we've been very selective in the auto space and we've been very selective in a number of point of sales spaces that we participate in and we continue as to test the production that's going on the book and we do believe that expected losses in this portfolio we're targeting them to be less than 2.5%. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Couple of questions please, MBS premium amortization, can you just give us some nitpicky ones? What was the amount in the second quarter, when do you expect it to go in the third quarter? David Turner : So, Vivek this is -- we've had in kind of the mid 30s in terms of premium amortization, we do expect that to increase modestly over the second half of the year, maybe up $5 million to $7 million each of the quarters, third and fourth quarter, just dependent on prepayments that come in, we see the refinance activities that\u2019s occurring through pipelines and at volume for us so we can project that out a little bit in terms of prepayment fees and expect it will tick up just a bit. Now that being said that is embedded in our forecast of our NII growth which we say would be somewhere in the right at the 3% range for the year. Vivek Juneja : So, it didn't go up, David in the second quarter, you're waiting for prepayments to show the path before you increase in the third quarter? David Turner : Yes, correct. Vivek Juneja : And capital, a bigger picture question, how do you get it down, for both of you? You've got such a high level, you\u2019re close to 100% payout, what do you do to bring this down? Obviously long term it\u2019s not -- you're not growing that any faster based on all the other factors that you're taking into account. David Turner : So, we've -- like over time we've mentioned to get to our capital targets and bring those down over time, if you look at the CCAR continuing to address a couple of things there, one, the stress is in each of the portfolios, we have some learning's that we can take from that as we reshape certain of our businesses to take out risk which then reduces the amount of capital you need to have in particular in a stressed environment. We did not have -- go over a 100% of earnings, we did have a couple of regional players that did for the first time. For us, we want to make sure we optimize our capital structure in terms of the nature of the components, so preferred stock and common stock alike and make sure that that's optimized and overtime we will do that to reduce our cost of equity. But I think working on the stresses is apparent [ph] in the balance sheet which we've done and you've seen that come down in places like commercial real estate losses came down quite dramatically. But still high. And so how do we change our business model overtime to reduce the amount of capital we have to have so that we can either put it to work if there is opportunity to grow loans and when there is not returning that capital to our shareholders especially when you've traded it, when we traded at tangible book value. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can I question your loan to deposit ratio upticked a little bit this quarter to 84%. What's the optimal level for that loan-to-deposit ratio for you folks and how do you plan to reach that level? David Turner : Yeah, Gerard it's a good question. So, we've been one of the lower loan deposit ratios. I think getting up a few more points perhaps in the upper 80s, lower 90s is the right place for us to be. In the good old days it would be over a 100% when you could rely on wholesale funding and that you could take money out every night, that really -- that market doesn't operate that way. So, I would say upper 80s lower 90s. I do think the construct and the deposits we have given the LCR framework deposits, certain deposits are as useful to us and in particular as we think about liquidity. Those process that are collateralized provide little liquidity value to us and that value really stems from the diversification of funding more so than actual liquidity because we\u2019re having a most [ph] of our best security for it. So, I think you will see that drift up a bit overtime, the pace of which is hard to tell. Grayson Hall : And Gerard if you look at our deposits this quarter, core deposits is really a very good story. We've created a much more favorable mix of deposits and we've reduced some of our deposits to David's point they are less attractive under LCR, but also less attractive at the end of the day from a liquidity perspective and so while our deposits were down modestly at the top of the company this quarter actually core deposits, core deposits that we find attractive were actually up and the liquidity in the company actually improved. And so we continue to believe that the core value this franchise really is a deposit gatherer and we continue to have a very good story there and a good message back and so I think that to David's point there was a time when you could fund loans in a very different way, but today best way to fund loans is with core deposits and we think in that high 80s low 90s would optimize the earnings power of this company. But we're going to need good solid organic loan growth to make that occur. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And regarding the consolidation of the branches, have you guys done any work to measure when you consolidate or shut down a branch? What percentage of the customers stay with you? Yeah, go ahead I was going to follow up, but go ahead David. David Turner : Go ahead and finish. Gerard Cassidy : Yeah, okay. And then with the advent of the mobile technology you all have today versus 15 years ago when if you shut down some branches the numbers may have different, have you've noticed, is there a differential meaning you're keeping more than today because of the mobile technology? David Turner : I think, one, is since I guess since 2007-2008 we've closed the consolidated over 500 branch offices. We have a very good process for that. I think that from our perspective, we continue to see that how do the process for consolidating those offices really have to do a lot with customer communication and how you equip and train and staff the receding offices. And to the extent, if the receding offices is at relatively close proximity and we would say that close proximities within 10 miles of the other branch that you're seeing very-very good success with virtually no losses in customers in that regard. We do think that alternative channels ATM, call center, mobile, online all of those other channels provide us an opportunity to provide strong connectivity to the customer and while we're seeing branches losing traffic in the sort of 3% to 5% a year range, we're seeing tremendous growth in the online and mobile channels. So we think continuing to add functionality there enhances the customer experience, it enhances the retention of those customers. But I would say all of it has to be done, you have to do all those things well in order to have a successful consolidation. But great question is one that we continue to adjust and fine-tune on a regular basis. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : I wanted to ask about Slide 14 which has gone into the loans split in Texas and Louisiana, I guess I am curious with energy prices trying to stabilize, does that pertain that you would want to see those markets to be stabilized in terms of loan balances or could we actually see growth on those areas? David Turner : I think if you look at Texas and Louisiana on those slides, very important markets for us and a much more diversified market than you would have seen a few years ago and even though we're seeing obvious stress from our customers that are directly or indirectly tied to the energy business. We're seeing an off a lot of strength in other industries, we're seeing an off a lot of opportunities that still provide banking services in those markets and so we're still very confident about our ability to grow there. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session at today's conference. I'll now turn the floor back over to Mr. Hall for closing remark. Grayson Hall : Thank you very much for your attendance and participation today, really appreciate your questions and your interest and thank you, we strand adjourned [ph]. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer Session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions' third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Participating on the call are Grayson Hall, Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also present and available to answer questions. A copy of the slide presentation reference throughout this call as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risk and uncertainties. And we may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as well as GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing our strategic plan. We are pleased with our continued progress on fundamentals despite a challenging operating environment. Dave is going to take you through details shortly, but let me just provide a few highlights. For the quarter we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $304 million and earnings per share of $0.24. There are number of items that impacted the quarter, which we will address as we review the results, but all-in-all a good quarter and solid quarter for regions. We delivered solid revenue growth by increasing deposits and non-interest income total adjusted revenue increased 5% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by strong adjusted non-interest growth of 12%. Clear evidence that our investments are paying off, notably capital markets and wealth management both produced record quarters. As part of our continuing efforts to grow and diversify revenue, we recently announced the acquisition of low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management business of First Sterling Financials. This acquisition complements our existing low income housing tax credit origination business and further expands our capital market capabilities and our ability to serve our customers. With respect to market conditions, the global macroeconomic environment continues to remain somewhat challenging. As such it's critical that we focus on things that are within our power to control. And to that end we remain committed to disciplined expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next three years is clearly underway. However based on current expectations for continued low rate low growth environment we have determined that additional expense eliminations are necessary to operate in this environment, to go beyond the $300 million amount. To that end we have targeted additional $100 million, which we expect to achieve by 2019. In total this $400 million represents 11.5% of our adjusted expenses base. Turning to asset quality for just a moment, we continue to see some stress in certain segments given where we are in the cycle, but we view our overall asset quality as stable today. In addition the continue stabilization of oil prices has positively impacted certain credit metrics. With regards to loans, we continue to exercise caution and remain focused on prudent and quality loan growth. Regarding business lending, average loans are down modestly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to experience muted customer demand and heavy competition in the business segment, particularly in the middle market commercial and small business sectors. We are also seeing some large corporate customers\u2019 accessing the capital markets and are using these proceeds to pay down bank debt. In addition we experience 100 basis points decline in line utilization of commercial customers during the quarter. Corporate customers remain focused on liquidity, which is evidenced by a 2% increase in average corporate bank segment projects. Excluding the impact of public funds average deposits in the corporate bank at Regions are up 5%. In addition, direct energy loans continue to pay down or pay off and over the past two quarters we have seen a favorable decline of approximately $500 million and on a point-to-point and approximately $300 million on a linked quarter correlations. It\u2019s important to point out that while reduced demand is impacting industry, we are deliberately limiting production in certain areas. For example, investor real estate in particular is an area where we remain guarded we\u2019re also limiting exposure specifically to multi-family and medical office buildings. Year-to-date in these -- outstanding balances in these portfolios have declined approximately $300 million combined on a point-to-point basis. Importantly we continue to focus on achieving appropriate risk adjusted returns within our business, portfolios and relationships and we believe this approach will lead to quality loan growth in the future. Despite market uncertainty the overall health of the consumer remains strong and we continue to see solid demand and steady growth in almost all of our consumer loan categories. With respect to capital, we\u2019re encouraged by recent regulatory directions and comments and the subsequent notice of proposed rulemaking, which we believe will be constructive for Regions. That said, our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged first and foremost we\u2019re focused on prudent organic growth. We will also continue to evaluate strategic alternatives that increase revenue or reduce operating expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date we have returned approximately 99% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In closing, our third quarter results reflect to continue to execution of our plans and our commitment to our three primary strategic initiatives which are; number one, grow and diversify our revenue streams; two, is to practice discipline expanse management; and three, to effectively deploy our capital. With that, I will turn it over to Dave who will cover the details for the third quarter. Dave? David Turner : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Grayson noted several items impacted the third quarter, now I\u2019ll speak to each of them as we move through the results. So let\u2019s get started with the balance sheet and look at average loans. Average loan balances totaled $81 billion in the third quarter, down 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending experienced another solid quarter of growth as average consumer loan balances increased $302 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending as balances increases $259 million linked quarter, reflecting another seasonally strong quarter of production. We continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point of sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $93 million linked quarter or 14%. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $44 million or 4% as penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.2% an improvement of 50 basis points.  Now turning to the indirect auto portfolio average balances decreased $36 million during the quarter, we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network, while exiting certain smaller dealers. In addition we remain focused on achieving appropriate risk adjusted returns in this portfolio. And average equity balances decreased $94 million as the pace of run-off exceeded production.  Now turning to the business services portfolio, as Grayson mentioned the decrease in average business service loans during the quarter was driven by an approximate $300 million decline in average direct energy loans. In addition loan growth was impacted by a continued softness in demand for middle market commercial and small business loans. Furthermore, we are remaining disciplined with our management of concentration risk limits, and a continued focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. More specifically we are limiting our exposure to multi-family and medical office buildings. And as a result, total business lending average balances decreased $979 million or 2% during the quarter. Despite this decline, there are areas within business services experiencing growth, such as technology and defense and asset based lending. And we expect to continue to leverage our go-to-market strategy of local bankers working with industry and product specialists to deliver the entire bank to our customers to meet their particular needs. Related we are also making progress with our focus on profitability and are using capital more effectively. Through July, we have achieved greater relevance in a number of large corporate relationships and improved our risk adjusted returns on these loans by over 200 basis points.  Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Total average deposit balances increased $439 million from the previous quarter, including $330 million of growth in average low cost deposits. Deposit cost remained near historically low levels at 12 basis points, and total funding cost remained low, totaling 30 basis points for the quarter. Total average deposits in the consumer segment were up $483 million or 1% in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our retail franchise. The overall health of the consumer, and our ability to grow low cost deposits. As previously noted, average corporate segments increased $675 million or 2% during the quarter, as corporate customers remained focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the wealth management segment decreased $637 million or 6% during the quarter as certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities continue to shift out of deposits and into other fee income producing customer investments. So let\u2019s see all this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $856 million, a decrease of $13 million or 1% from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.06%. Net interest income and other financing income was negatively impacted by a $7 million leverage lease residual value adjustment. And this adjustment reduce net interest margin by 3 basis points. In addition historically low rates experienced in the second and third quarters of 2016 caused prepayments in our mortgage back securities book to increase, resulting in higher premium amortization of approximately $13 million during the quarter. However, given the recent moves to modestly higher long-term rates, we expect $4 million to $6 million of improvement in premium amortization during the fourth quarter. And lastly lower average loan balances further reduced net interest income and other financing income in the quarter. Now these reductions were partially offset by higher short-term rates, one additional day in the quarter, and our debt deleveraging that we executed this quarter. So if you exclude the impact of the $7 million leverage lease residual value adjustment and the expected $4 million premium amortization improvement, net interest income and other financing income for the third quarter would have been approximately $867 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis and a margin of 3.09%. And we believe the fourth quarter will approximate these amounts. Non-interest income increased 14% in the quarter and included the impact of $47 million of insurance proceeds associated with the previously disclosed settlement related to FHA insured mortgage loans. Adjusted non-interest income growth was particularly strong in the third quarter and reflected our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify revenue. Almost every non-interest revenue category increased driven by record capital markets and wealth management income and growth in card and ATM fees resulting in a 5% increase compared to the second quarter.  Capital market's fee income grew $4 million or 11% during the quarter, driven primarily by the mergers and acquisition advisory services group. Card and ATM income increased $6 million or 6% during the quarter, driven by an increase in a number of active cards and spend volume.  Wealth management income increased $4 million or 4% during the quarter, driven by increased investment management and trust fees as assets under administration increased 5% from $88.1 billion to $92.6 billion. Mortgage income was stable during the quarter as increased gains from loan sales were offset by declines in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 67% was related to purchase activity and 33% was related to refinancing. Also during the quarter we completed a bulk purchase for the rights to service approximately $2.8 billion of mortgage loans. And year-to-date we\u2019ve purchased the rights to service approximately $6 billion of mortgage loans and our mortgage portfolio service for others has grown from approximately $26 billion to $30 billion over the past year. We still have additional capacity and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio. Other non-interest income includes the recovery of $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. We also recognized an $8 million leverage lease termination gain, which was substantially offset by related increase in income taxes. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decline in revenue from market value adjustments related to employee benefit assets, which were offset in salaries and benefit expense and resulted in no impact to pre-tax income. As it relates to future non-interest income growth, Regions is one of the nation's largest participants in affordable housing finance through the low income housing tax credits program. And we're excited about the opportunity to enhance our capabilities through the recently announced acquisition of the low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management businesses of First Sterling. Let's move onto expenses. Total non-interest expenses increased 2% during the quarter and include a $14 million charge for the early extinguishment of parent company debt and a $5 million charge associated with branch closures we announced last quarter. On an adjusted basis expenses totaled $912 million, representing a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. Total salaries and benefits increased $6 million from the second quarter, primarily due to one additional week day, which accounts for approximately $5 million. Production based incentives also increased during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by $4 million decrease in expenses related to market value adjustments associated with assets held for certain employee benefits, which were offset in other non-interest income that I mentioned. In addition, year-to-date staffing levels have decline 5% or approximately 1,200 positions as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Looking at the fourth quarter and excluding any impact from market value adjustments, we expect salaries and benefits to decline as a result of one less week day in the quarter and the impact of continuing expense management. Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million during the quarter, primarily due to increases in legal reserves. As expected FDIC insurance assessments increased $12 million in the third quarter, including a $5 million related to the implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge. In addition, the second quarter assessment benefited from a $6 million refund related to prior period over payments. The company also incurred $8 million related to the reserve for unfunded commitments, as well as $11 million of expense related to Visa class B shares sold in a prior year. The Visa class B shares have restructuring to the finalization of certain covered litigation. The current quarter charge primarily relates to a class-action settlement that was overturned on appeal and we would not expect this level of expense to repeat. For the first nine months of 2016, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.3% and we have generated 3% positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. As Grayson mentioned, we have targeted an additional $100 million in expense eliminations beyond our original announcement bringing the total target of $4 million or 11.5% of our adjusted expense base. And we will continue identify opportunities to pull those savings forward whenever possible. Just move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $54 million in the third quarter, a decreased of $18 million from the second quarter and represented 26 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our energy portfolio totaled $6 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $25 million less in net charge-offs in the quarter and our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased 2 basis points to 1.39%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7.9% in the third quarter compared to 9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in our overall energy book. Total non-accrual loans excluding loans held for sale increased to 1.33% of loans outstanding. There were five energy and energy related loans which primarily drove the increase in non-accrual loans. However, the increased provision associated with these loans was more than offset by the credit quality improvement in the balance of the energy portfolio driven by a continued energy price stabilization as well as declines in loans outstanding. Troubled debt restructured loans and total delinquencies were relatively flat, while total business services criticized loans increased 2%. The increase in criticized loans was driven by a small number of multi-family construction and transportation loans that were downgraded from past to special mention. While oil prices are continuing to stabilize uncertainty remains. We expect cumulative losses for all of 2016 and 2017 to range between $50 million and $75 million and should oil prices average below $25 per barrel through the end of 2017 we would expect incremental losses of $100 million. Through the first nine months of 2016 we\u2019ve incurred $23 million of charge-offs related to our energy portfolio. And we are encouraged by the performance of our energy segment to-date. However we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. Given where we are in the credit cycle and considering fluctuation in commodity prices, the volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits. Let\u2019s talk about capital liquidity. Under Basel III the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. In addition our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. In terms of expectations for the remainder of 2016, we expect both average loans and average deposits to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter 2015, our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged, with full year growth of between the 2% to 4% range. As a result of our investments, we now expect to grow full-year adjusted non-interest income by more than 6%. Total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015, and we expect to achieve a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 63% with a positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. And we continue to expect full-year net charge-offs to be in that 25 to 35 basis point range. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A session of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning. We will now open the line for questions. Operator : This floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt O'Conner of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Conner: Good morning. I was hoping to follow-up on the expenses of debt and couple of questions, I guess one anymore color or can you frame how much of the $400 million of cost saves will fall to the bottom-line or what it means to expenses overall? And then what's the base off of because I\u2019m a little confused this quarter the cost came in higher than expected, part of it was higher revenue and even adjusting for that it seem like a little bit higher and then you\u2019re increasing the cost target. So I am trying to figure out what the base is and then what it means for overall expenses? David Turner : Yes. So, Matt we\u2019ll -- we have some more work to identify what that additional $100 million would be, in what year it would fall in, we did extend that component of the cost elimination program to 2019.That being said, as I mentioned we are trying to bring forward as much as we can. The base we\u2019ve been working off is that base from last year, which is about $3.450-ish range, $3.454 billion I think the more exact. And that\u2019s an adjusted expense number. So that's what we\u2019re pegging this $400 million off of and that's where you calculate 11.5% from. Matt O\u2019Conner: And just specifically in terms of this quarter's expenses I mean besides the items you caught out within adjusted expenses, would you view kind of the adjusted expense base as being a bit inflated? I know you talked about some decreased coming in 4Q on seasonality, but is it an inflated level? David Turner : Yes, that\u2019s right and that\u2019s why I tried if you go through the -- what I was enumerating and not just on the adjusted schedule, but it enumerated some of the unusual things that occurred in the fourth quarter, that that $912 is higher than our quarter run rate. Matt O\u2019Conner: Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John John Pancari : Good morning. Back to expenses, I just want to get a little bit feel how this impacts your efficiency ratio, I mean if you look at it, you\u2019re running year-to-date around 63.5$ or so and so, and you came in around 65% for the third quarter, I just want to just get some color on how you are confident that you\u2019re going to come in below 63% for the full 2016, so what that means for fourth quarter? And then more importantly, just overall thoughts on 2017 efficiency what we can expect out of that? David Turner : Yes so kind of consistent with Matt\u2019s question we believe the adjusted number of 912 was higher than the run rate that you'll see in the fourth quarter and into 2017. We still need some more work John around the 2017 numbers. We'll highlight that in the first part of December at our next conference in terms of what we think we'll do over the next three years on a number of metrics. But if we put our forecast and for the fourth quarter recalculate the adjusted expense number we think we'll be right on top of 63%. John Pancari : Okay. All right, no that helps I was just trying to go at it a different way. And then separately on the loan growth front, I wanted to see if I can get your thoughts on the outlook for loan growth for 2017. I know you've flagged a couple of times the weaker business loan demand in mid-market and a conservative approach to certain portfolios that you flagged as well. So can you talk about how you feel about loan growth as you look into 2017 considering that? Grayson Hall : Yes I mean John if you look at our reported earnings for the third quarter, clearly consumer was very strong quarter. We're very encouraged by what we saw on the consumer not only for a loan growth standpoint, but from an asset quality perspective continues to be very good and very stable. And we think while there is some seasonality in consumer lending in particular around mortgage lending. We do anticipate that that positive momentum carries forward. On the commercial side especially in the small to medium size enterprises, we had very good production in the third quarter. But we also had an abnormally high level of payoffs and paydowns and in particular around reductions in outstanding zone on commercial lines of credit.  When you look at our thoughts for fourth quarter we think production bodes well, but we do anticipate stability in the fourth quarter. I would just ask John Turner who heads up that group for us to add a little bit more color. Because I think this is an important question. John M. Turner, Jr. : Yes thank you, Grayson. We've said as we think about our strategy that we're underpenetrated in certain markets, businesses and portfolios. We have we think too many single service kind of credit only relationships. We've been good about client selectivity, but not as focused on returns. And so as we think about our businesses and our desired credit better mix of revenue, we've talked about real estate and our desire to manage that carefully given where we are in the cycle. Within our larger credit exposures our corporate banking business again we want to be thoughtful that business has been growing over the last few years, but it grows with large exposures. And so we're mindful of the toll free risk and mindful of the returns that we're getting in that business. And so a lot of what we've been doing there over the last nine months is reallocating capital within that portfolio to relationships that are going to generate higher risk adjusted returns. And we're beginning to see meaningful impact as a result of that. And I think it's also as you could see helping to grow non-interest revenue, which is up almost 20% year-over-year. And then finally within middle market and small business it's really important we think that again we build those relationships out broadly. We don't chase opportunities while Grayson said production was good we had an opportunity to generate almost again half as much credit as we did, but it wasn't priced appropriately or the structures we didn't think were consistent with our risk appetite. So we have some leverage to pull. If we felt like that we needed to do that, but we believe that a disciplined approach to building long-term prudent sustainable relationships that are profitable to the company that generate value for our customers and for our shareholders is appropriate. And so we'll see stabilization we think in the fourth quarter and then we believe kind of modest growth I think we've indicated David in 2017. John Pancari : And then I'm sorry just one more thing, the modest growth that you just mentioned there John, is that back to where you were previously in that sub 3% type of range? David Turner : Yes so John this is David. So we'll put together our total loan growth plan that's what we'll share with you on the 2017 metrics. But John was trying to address we believe we will have certain things working against us energy being a big one in 2017 as much as we had this past year. So we'll give you more specificity on loan growth at the next conference. John Pancari : Thanks. And did you quantify that the paydowns in the commercial real estate side? Grayson Hall : I don't think we did. I can't recall whether we\u2026 David Turner : The main decline we had talked about was energy, over the last couple of quarters it\u2019s been about $500 million with average of 300 of that this past quarter. John M. Turner, Jr. : Yes and I think the number in real estate was about 300 point-to-point. And again as we try to remix our business real estate as an example and shift from a very high level of construction loan production to a better mix of term lending and construction lending. We can't manage the timing as you can imagine. And so it is going to be a bit lumpy as we experienced paydowns and the construction book and we seek to grow the term book. And so we overtime expect to grow real estate as the economy grows, but we'll have I think some timing differences as we attempt to remix that business. Grayson Hall : But John as you saw in this quarter when we with all the actions we're taking we\u2019re actually reducing the risk profile of our overall loan portfolio and are encouraged with the progress we're making in that regard. It does create some noise on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But I think the point is we're trying to be very thoughtful and very prudent about reducing the overall risk profile of our portfolio. John Pancari : Okay, thanks Grayson. Thanks for taking all the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask little bit about credit quality, the charge-offs David this quarter came in at the low end of your range with the 26 basis points. Do you expect to hold the lower end in the near-term in terms of the charge-offs? And then on the reserve front are you comfortable letting the reserve go further down from this 139 or so? And what do you expect the provision to kind of match charge-offs going forward? Barbara Godin : Yes this is Barbara. I'll take that question. Relative to -- I'll touch the reserve first as you know we have a pretty prudent ways we go about looking at it consistently we also looking at our reserves. So we will let the numbers speak for themselves at that point. However I don't see us going back to what we call the old days of something sub 1% coverage. We came in at 139 as you know. So we'll move in and around that band for what that\u2019s worth relative to charge-offs. It was a great charge-off quarter. I would stick with our guidance of 25 to 35 basis points as we close out the year and that would include the fourth quarter coming up. Grayson Hall : But again there can be a considerable volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And given the granularity of the portfolio and all the larger credits we have. But overall to Barb's point very good quarter from a credit quality standpoint this quarter. Had a lot of things moving around, but at the end of the day we think we're in a good place. John McDonald : Okay. Just to follow-up on that part. The consumer charge-off ratios if we look in the supplemental is showing a trend of going up and obviously growing this from a small base. So just kind a wondering what you're seeing there is it seasoning that you kind of expect this trend. These are small numbers right now, but as you grow this consumer portfolio. Give destinations in mind for where these charge-off ratios should be headed? Barbara Godin : Yes firstly they're all within our risk appetite so we're very comfortable with what's happening in the consumer book. What we see is real estate continues to improve in particularly we see home equity was down significantly this quarter. Mortgage is really back to with all-time low tracking along the bottom. Some of the other portfolios that we see indirect is pretty stable. And then of course we have a handful of new initiatives that we're looking at that contributed a little bit a few million to our numbers overall. But again on the revenue side, we're seeing that handful of increased losses are more than offset by the increased revenues. So we don't see the consumer book moving up significantly in terms of overall losses at this point. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy L. Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy L. Graseck: Hi, good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Betsy L. Graseck: Hey couple of questions. One is on expenses, just in general what do you think your normalized expense increases on an annual basis? Not including the cost saves, but just what you have to consider as normal course of inflation of expenses? David Turner : Yes, I think if you start back at that 3,454 number and we go up modestly there, we are hitting that run rate, so adjust expenses 912 that\u2019s a little bloated I tried to numerate those if you carve those out you\u2019re going to band that 880 range, 885 range is probably where that\u2019s more normal run rate. Betsy L. Graseck: Okay. David Turner : Well, that\u2019s all adjusted. Betsy L. Graseck: Right. So, if you\u2019re talking about a 2% or 3% normalized increase from just salaries and expense inflation then we are looking at over a three year period and I\u2019ll look where you should be able to brining your expense dollars down over three year period. Is that fair? David Turner : Well, one another thing that\u2019s important to us strategically as we laid out at Investor Day is to grow and diversify our revenue and to continue to make investments and in order to make those investments we have to -- and control expenses at the time we have to have saving from our kind of our core operations and that's really what the $300 million now $400 million is all about. And so we have to continue to find other ways to become more efficient because it is firstly important for us to continue to grow our company and to grow non-interest revenue in particular. And so having a reduction in expense versus having them flat to up modestly, which is what we have today and again we\u2019ll give you 2017 and beyond, but it will be somewhere in that range as well. Betsy L. Graseck: Okay. So I am missing in my little calculation is the investment spending you\u2019re making. Okay. And then just separately you no longer have to deal with qualitative part of the CCAR test, I know the regulators say that they are going to be accessing your process in the normal course regulation, but maybe you could give us a sense as to how much that helps you in terms of dealing not only with the CCAR itself at that point in time of the year, but also how you think about the capital return that might open up for you without the qualitative test issue that you have had to deal with over the past years? David Turner : So, I\u2019ll start with obviously the still just a notice to proposed rulemaking, so we still need finalization there. But based on what is out there I think it\u2019s constructive for the industry, for the regional bank space. As that being said, we manage our capital in the manner we\u2019ve laid out a capital planning process and all the governances and none of that\u2019s going to change. We are going to continue to have robust capital planning and loss forecasting. What this does is that plus learning that we get from each CCAR filing help us frame up what we could do with our capital, first and foremost we want to leverage our capital to grow organically. And that's first order of business. We want to make investments to -- for bolt-on acquisitions that we have done you saw the one we released yesterday, those are important.  Having a fair dividend to our shareholders is important and then when we have excess capital that we are generating having an appropriate return in the form of a share buyback is an order. So, I think given all of that, it gives us an ability to think about capital targets relative to the risk that we have in our balance sheet and we have mentioned that based on today\u2019s risk that we have that common equity Tier 1 ratio in the 9.5% is where we would target overtime and we\u2019re at approximately 11%. So, we have capital to be put to work or to be given back to shareholders overtime. And so I think all the body of evidence that we have will help us manage that in a prudent manner over perhaps a shorter period of time. We have to think through that though Betsy it\u2019s a little early to tell what that exactly means for our CCAR submission in 2017. Betsy L. Graseck: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Grayson Hall :  Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. Just wonder if you could give us some color around the increase in criticized loans in the multi-family in transport area? Barbara Godin : Absolutely Betsy it\u2019s Barbara begin. So what we had is we had effectively in multi-family three credits two of them are in the Houston area one was in Oklahoma, the one in the Houston area, I'll give you a little more color on. Higher concessions than originally expected so we move that to a special mention loan. Another that was also in the Houston area, construction delays due to rainfall. So we moved that one over. And the last one is in Oklahoma 93% complete on that building. Marginally behind schedule in terms of the leasing, but we still expect completion of the building by the end of December. So again we look at everything relative to how you are supposed to be performing in any of these credits. And if you're not performing as per what we originally laid out we will move you to a special mention. The transportation credits are energy related one large transportation credit energy related. What I would say though about our overall criticized book is that 93% of our criticized book in the business services area is paying as agreed. So I don't expect at the end of the day that there will be a significant number of losses at all coming from any of those loans that we've moved over. Jennifer Demba : Okay. Separate question on your branch sales incentive. Grayson, do you expect any meaningful change to your branch sales incentives given the backdrop of what happened with Wales [ph]? Grayson Hall : Yes I think given the backdrop that the industry is facing right now I think the prudent thing to do and I assume all of our competitors are doing that is taking very deep dive on all of our sales practices using both our internal leadership, internal experts as well as external advisors to re-challenge ourselves on all of our sales practices. We're quite proud of the culture we've build at Regions. We\u2019ve had sales culture that is really based on shared values making sure that's customer focused and that we're doing the right thing for customers in the right way. And our messaging is quite strong and the feedback we get from surveys and external sources is very encouraging. But all that being said we believe in the backdrop of all that's going on that we're all re-challenging ourselves to make sure that everything is done correctly and appropriately. And that activity is going on here. As I'm sure is going on everyone. But as I said we've got a lot of confidence in the processes we built. We think we're doing the right things, but more importantly we think we're doing them the right way. But we got to make sure that that's occurring in all aspects. And so given the backdrop we are re-reviewing everything we are doing. Jennifer Demba : Thanks very much. Operator :  Your next question comes from Steve Marsh of FBR. Steve Marsh : Good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Steve Marsh : Just want to circle back on expenses a little bit. I know in the past you've talked about pulling forward expenses. And I was wondering what's the possibility that the $300 million you to complete it in 2017? David Turner : Yes so we are continuing to challenge ourselves on the $300 million plus additional $100 million in term of the timing and are looking to pull forward as much as prudent without harming the long-term franchise. So I can't give you probability of being able to complete that in 2017, I think getting all of that in 2017 will be very difficult. But could we move some of it that is currently in 2018 and 2017; I think that's an appropriate challenge to our team. And we'll be coming back again after this challenge in December at our next conference we'll lay out with that three year plan looks like including metrics like operating leverage and efficiency and just total expense bogie as well. Steve Marsh : Okay. And then my second question on investment securities yields, just wondering what is your new money purchase yield these days? David Turner : Well if we're in the mortgage backs are about one and three quarters about 1.75 to 2 and corporate bonds are 2.30 range to 2.75. But the preponderance of what we\u2019re at have been adding the mortgage backs. Steve Marsh : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Michael. Michael Rose : Hey, good morning. Just another follow-up on expenses, the additional $100 million that you identified is there -- and I\u2019m sorry, if I miss this, is there any change in kind of complexion of what that $100 million comprises relative to the $300 million that you laid out during Investor Day? David Turner : No, Michael those are -- if you go back to Investor Day you\u2019ll see roughly four broad categories of expense, I suspect they\u2019ll fall into those categories. I think you should expect us to leverage -- see us leveraging technology a bit more, which gives us time to put things in place to help those from an efficiency standpoint. So that could be one of the changes, as we go through this, we kind of started on the human capital side and then getting into really third-party spend, which we\u2019ve done some of there\u2019s probably smart room there. We continue work on occupancy cost and branch consolidations and office space, as you know we had a million square feet, we wanted to take out over the initial three year period of time, we\u2019re in good shape with that. But we\u2019re continuing to challenge ourselves on those kind of areas, we think there\u2019ll be more to come there. Michael Rose : Is it fair to say that most of the kind of heavy lifting from the expenses efforts have been realized at this point, one of your competitor this morning basically said that they had anything kind of incremental beyond today\u2019s announcement would be much smaller. Is that similar view for you guys or if you were to take a more critical of your branch network could you actually see some more material savings as we move forward? Grayson Hall : No, I mean Michael, you look at the past few years, we\u2019ve been very focused on efficiency and trying to find expenses and obviously the duration of this operating environment has continue to put substantial pressure on expense management and a lot of the easy first steps are all behind us in terms of expense management and really what we\u2019re doing now is having to sort of transform how you do business. And if you look at the investments, we\u2019ve made in a lot of our digital channels, investments we\u2019ve made in sort of re-tooling our branches and how we operate out of our branches, we are really at this point in time having to really challenge ourselves on how we go to market in certain parts of the company. And as David said using technology to make those people more efficient and more effective. So the answer to your question, easy expense saves along mind has have been for a while. And so the things we\u2019re doing now are much more transformative, interesting take a little more longer to execute, but at this juncture you really have to look at how you do business, rather than just trying to look at normal inefficiencies and process. Michael Rose : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just one more for Barbara on energy, I appreciate the guidance around charge-offs for energy reiteration that you provided. What would cause you to be kind of at the lower end of your range and then what sort of variables would cause you to be at the upper end of that $75 million. Barbara Godin : Yes, Michael, it\u2019s clearly oil prices, where they sit right now generally around that $50 area that provides some stabilization, but we honestly don\u2019t believe that things will really move in the right direction, until we get somewhere in the $60 a barrel range, give or take. But if they stay at $50 we do see stabilization in our metrics. If they go down into again you saw our guidance of sub-$30 we would expect significant increases i.e., being an additional $100 million, but if oil got down into the $30 a barrel range as well we would also see some upward pressure on all of our credit metrics and in our charge-offs as well. And by the way, just for some more color on the energy charge-offs that we did have this quarter of the $6 million that we had roughly $1.5 million was coal. So year-to-date, we\u2019ve had $23 million in energy charge-offs and of that approximately $9.5 million, $10 million is related to the coal portion of our book as well. Michael Rose : It\u2019s very helpful, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, thank you, thank you for taking the question. In your prepaid remarks I think you mentioned examining strategic alternatives to increase revenues or reduce expenses, I wonder if you could elaborate on what you were referring to about? David Turner : So, when we talk about strategy it would be the thing like we saw yesterday with our announcement of First Sterling continuing to make any type of investments that are helping us to serve our customers to give us more fulsome offering to our customer base as we seek to meet their need. There are other investments that we seek to make we talked a little bit about leveraging technology to help us from a cost standpoint overtime. So we are looking at different technologies to help us look at process improvement to help us where we might be able to get a better answer to take labor out and improve our internal control structure for making those type of technology investments. So, those were kind of the ideas we had. Grayson Hall : Yes, as we really believe the best strategy for us at this point in time is to really focus on executing our plans, we got plans that allow us to continue to improve the fundamentals of the company. If you look at the fundamentals, the fundamentals are posting up some very good numbers in particular on the consumer side of our house, but really across the board.  And so, that focus on execution is a key point of what we are do. And the other side is innovation, I think in this market you got to be able to execute, which is also you got to be able to innovate. And we\u2019re spending an awful lot of time trying to figure out how we innovate in a way that better serve our customers and does in a way that creates greater efficiency in the way we operate. So, I think that we got a number of good strategic moves that we are making that will help improve the overall performance of the company. Geoffrey Elliott : So it sounds like the focus is more around bolt-on acquisitions, why you think you can do something to improve efficiency rather than selling businesses, which you look out and you don\u2019t think fit anymore? David Turner : Yes, I think actually what we\u2019ve done thus far that you\u2019ve seen our advancements on things like our [indiscernible] initiative, [indiscernible]. We do challenge ourselves on our businesses and to ensure that they are seeking appropriate return -- risk adjusted return on the business and when we have a business that can\u2019t help us meet our return hurdles and or don\u2019t serve a customer than we\u2019ll challenge ourselves on that. But right now it\u2019s been investments to really help us grow and diversify our revenue and that diversification is moving a little bit away from NII to NIR it\u2019s moving geographically, it\u2019s diversifying in products and services that we offer to give us a little more balance in terms of how we generate revenue and earnings for our shareholders. Geoffrey Elliott : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jill Shea of Credit Suisse. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Jill. Jill Shea : Good morning. So, maybe just one fees you are on pace to grow fee income by more than 6% this year and you had some nice growth across capital markets card and wealth, can you just speak to some of the momentum that you are seeing in your fee income the remainder of this year and into next? Grayson Hall : Yes I mean, I will ask John Owen to sort of talk about some of our fee raised businesses and some of our growth rates we are seeing there. So a very encouraging story. John Owen : Sure, thanks Grayson. Good morning everyone. As Grayson said we are seeing steady improvement in our consumer business. If you look at our look at our account growth standpoint we grow checking accounts about 2.5%, debit card growth of about 4% year-over-year, credit card growth of about 12% year-over-year and are now banking customer account growth about 14%. The other point I would make is utilization on debit cards both total transactions and spend is up as well on card so those are driving a lot of our increases. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Jill Shea : And then maybe just any color on capital markets and wealth and some of the momentum you are seeing there? John M. Turner, Jr. : Sure, this is John Turner. We are continuing to build out our debt capital markets platform and doing that across a number of different products and capabilities. So what you\u2019ve seen as we have grown capital markets revenue significantly over the last two years is the introduction of some of those products and capabilities. We had a very nice third quarter largely built on the M&A advisory revenue that we generated. We also had a pretty good quarter in real estate permanent placements particularly through our Fannie DUS license. We expect to continue to see that kind of growth going forward as we continue to leverage these new capabilities. We're excited about the acquisition of the First Sterling businesses, the community investment capital business is one that's been very important to us. We decided that we wanted to grow that business strategically two years ago we set out to find syndication platform that would help us build out some distribution capabilities that we didn't have.  And so again that's another product capability that we have that will allow us to meet customer needs, grow revenue in a more diverse and balanced way. And we expect to see again nice growth in capital markets into 2017 as we leverage more of these capabilities. Grayson Hall : Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt Burnell : Good morning, Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. First on margin, I thought I heard David mentioned something about some loan repricing efforts that that you've been able to pass through. I'm curious if there is more of that to come and what the benefit might be going forward? And then I guess in a related question for David how do you think a 25 basis point hike if we're lucky enough to get it in December would benefit Q1 margin? Last year it was about five basis point benefit quarter-over-quarter on an adjusted basis. Should we see something similar in the first quarter if we were to get the 25 basis points? David Turner : Yes so I'll start with your second question first and I think when you look at 25 basis points to see where we\u2019re positioned you probably for the year in that $15 million to $20 million range. So your number is not too far off for the first quarter. I would tell you as we think about the returns improving our returns that's not just the pricing issue only. It's really the relationship, it's trying to get the relationship return which can include credit but it's going to include all the other products and services that we offer to that customer. And so we certainly are looking at things that have a credit only relationship that have a sub-optimal return for us. And those are the ones we want to try and get the relationship get our price improve, get our returns better or recycling and leveraging that capital into another option or another alternative. So I think overtime what you ought to see is we should have some positive impacts to margin the pace of which is really dependent on how we change this whole relationship and whether it's credit related or product and service driven. Grayson Hall : I would just add as we look at yields going on spreads our LIBOR did improve during the quarter more importantly though as David talks about I think you\u2019re seeing as a growth in fee revenue or growth in deposits. All because of our focus on relationship returns and just to underscore the work that's been done talk about our corporate banking portfolio particularly the shared national credit book and our desire to improve returns in that business. We actually exited almost $2 billion worth of credit in the first nine months of the year. We reallocated that capital back into new relationships and existing relationships and in doing that we increased the revenue per relationship over 50% and the risk adjusted returns in the business for almost 250 basis points. So we are seeing that activity really begin to have an impact. It will take some time to see it in the P&L but we believe that it is occurring and it's the right approach. David Turner : And Matt I'll add this is David. In terms of kind of margin expectations I try to put it in the prepared comments, we had a couple of things that were fairly unusual in the fourth quarter that pushed our margin down to the 306 that we think rebounds a bit in that 309 range give or take. There are a lot of things that can move, but based on the best evidence we have today, we'd be in that range, I give you about $11 million of NII that was a bit different for the quarter that we think help to give you some stability in terms of NII and resulting margin for the fourth quarter. Matt Burnell : Sure, no that makes sense David. Thank you for the color. And actually your comments earlier about the repricing and relationship are a nice segue into my final question. Specific to the capital markets business, how far along are you relative to where you'd ultimately like to get in terms of cross-selling those investment banking capital markets products into your corporate middle market credit customer base. John M. Turner, Jr. : Yes this John Turner. I'd say we're probably 70% along in developing 70% to 75% developing the product capabilities that we'd like to have in our debt capital market business. And maybe 20% to 25% along in terms of really capturing what we think is the opportunity within the business. Today about 24% of our total revenue in the corporate banking business is non-interest revenue and we'd like to see that number improve to 40% plus overtime which means we've effectively got to double the business. And we think that there is a visibility to get there it will take a while, but we see the opportunity clearly. Matt Burnell : Thanks for answering my questions. John M. Turner, Jr. : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Hey, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey guys, good morning. Just one quick follow up on credit, you talked about the quality of the book improving overtime as you remix. This quarter we still saw your ability with the energy improvement to release some reserves and the overall reserve loans ratio still quite high versus almost all peers at 14. So just can you talk about philosophically overtime with that change in the mix of the business, did we see that reserve to loans ratio continue to come down and as credit continues to prove on energy is there more room to still be releasing as we continue to see the improvements on the resi side as much as the potential improvements in energy? Thanks guys. Barbara Godin : Yes Ken it's Barb. And so as we book loans, book new loans are always going to have a provision associated with those. So I will put that as a positive to increase the provision. On the other side as our book continues to get better and our ratings improve on all of these credits, we also have the opportunity then again to reduce our overall provision on these. So net-net overtime if we're suggesting that we're going to have a book that's stable to some continued improvement. And you should see some stability in the provision to improving. And again a lot of that still will be driven by energy, you saw that this quarter. So as the number of energy credits got much better we were able to reduce our overall level of provision up to $350 million in that book. And we'll continue to review that book every quarter as we move through the next several quarters to see how that impacts our overall numbers. Ken Usdin : To follow-up, do you expect that the new stuff that you're adding on the consumer side is that higher loss rate content and does any change in your kind of philosophical like what you\u2019re through the cycle loss rate should be? I understand there is a lot of current things that are plus and minus underneath. Barbara Godin : Yes our overall philosophical we\u2019ve stated 75 basis points of loss to the cycle. We still believe that that's the right number consumer book was heavily weighted towards real estate and again real estate tracking in those low double-digit numbers in terms of losses. But also doesn't give you the returns of some of the other products that we're looking at do give us. So the answer is yes, we will see some increased credit cost on a consumer side. Although we think again they\u2019re going to be quite manageable. We do have limits and concentrations on any of those new initiatives that we do. Ken Usdin : Okay thanks a lot Barb. Operator : Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS. Grayson Hall : Hey, David. David Eads : Good morning or slightly afternoon now. Let me just follow-up for Barb, can you give a little bit of color about what you're seeing in the oilfield services portfolio? It looks like you\u2019ve had some declines in balances and commitment but you had a tick up in criticize. I mean is it one of these with that portfolio really is the only part that you're really worried about here and that improvements elsewhere are more than offsetting some continued kind of headwinds there? Barbara Godin : Yes I think you're correct. I think on the E&P side of our book that generally what we've seen is certainly some stabilization especially with prices where they are per barrel of oil. We have talked about in prior quarters that the oilfield services portion of our book will lag in terms of recovery to the E&P portion of our book and we're seeing that. And that's the reason we're continuing to guide between now and the end of next year we believe our total overall losses will be somewhere in that $50 million to $75 million potential total range. We are seeing that oilfield services here and there the stock is where we're seeing that they are getting back to work. But again that is as we said going to take I think the rest of 2017 for that to work itself out. David Eads : All right. And then you made some comments earlier about multi-family and some of the medical care facilities going back from those. And just want to get read is that more about fitting concentration limits and wanting to be disciplined on that front as oppose to seeing any kind of specific signs that are worrying on that kind of excluding some of the comments you made about Houston energy related locations where you're seeing some downgrades this quarter. Barbara Godin : You're exactly right. We do have the very disciplined concentration methodology. We learned a lot coming out of the last crisis and what we learned is diversification of our book and concentration limit management is paramount to having a good solid prudent book. And so as we've come up on some of our concentration limits, we've work very closely with in particular John Turner and his team to again recycle capital, but also stay well within those concentration limits. And again that's the reason for the commentary on that. The same thing with our medical office buildings. David Eads : Great, thanks. Operator :  Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Grayson Hall : Good afternoon, Marty. Marty Mosby : Hey, thanks. I got two bigger kind of strategic questions. As you look at Barb talking about your through the cycle losses. You always spend a lot of time derisking, offloading what could be some of more troublesome loans. It really overtime to get the benefit from that. I think you're seeing that with lower losses now. But she said also see with less volatility when we get in that downdraft. I think communicating and talking about the benefits of the derisking are going to be very important for Regions. Just your thought on as you keep saying 75 basis points the benefits of derisking and how you can see it materialize overtime? Barbara Godin : Right, thank you for those comments and you're absolutely right. We have spent a lot of time on the derisking as heard about derisking as you know in the real estate book. What we wanted to do is as we thought about how do we rerisk our portfolio that we do it with assets and we do with portfolio that are much less volatile and back to again that we do it within our concentration limits so that we don't get outside in anyone area in anyone product and sticking to that discipline. The other challenge that you have when you derisk a book and by derisking you sell a lot of the assets as you don't enjoy the recovery stream after whereas if you instead manage a book that is prudent and less volatile where you do have losses, you do also anticipate a benefit and also having future recoveries. So there is a lot of benefits to making sure that we stay within a pretty tight date on what we're doing. Grayson Hall : Because Marty we really are trying to make sure that we are not only diversifying, but we are remixing our loan portfolio to have it be a better performing asset through the cycle with reduced volatility exactly to your point. We're trying to be very careful about client selectivity trying to make sure that we understand who we\u2019re banking and how we're banking them. And we\u2019re trying to make sure we got a full relationship with that client. And we do believe that there will be points in the cycle where we'll grow less than some peers. But we do believe that what we're doing and diversifying and managing concentration risk will in back reduce the overall operating volatility of our company over a longer period of time. Marty Mosby : I have seen that and I just think that communicating and materializing how that's going to kind of play forward is going to be important. And then David on the extra $100 million in expense savings, you\u2019ve been producing 2 to 3 percentage points of operating leverage and actually revenue growth is picking up. So I just want to go back to how you catch it in this environment it almost seem like things weren't improving or you weren't getting revenue growth so you have had to go and dig harder. Are you just finding things as you\u2019ve gone through like you said redesigning that gave you another $100 million that you can now put on the table? I think the difference between that feeling is pretty important is it desperation or is it no we're just finding more things that we can do more with? David Turner : Yes Marty I would put it this way. We've been really working with the great set of urgency on efficiency. We know it's important, but we are finding investment opportunities and we know in this environment that we have figured out how to self-fund those investments. We have figured out how we can reduce our expenses to make those investment decisions. And those investment decisions are getting traction now, we are starting to see the benefits of some of the decision we\u2019ve made in terms of investments you are seeing that very strongly in capital market. But as we\u2019ve gotten into those process we just come to the conclusion that if this environment persist and we\u2019ve got to be even better and that we are finding opportunities that will allow us to extend this process early and we believe get our company into a much better position. We do believe that operating leverage is a right metric to look at, we continue to believe we\u2019re delivering on that. But it\u2019s going to require both work on both revenues and expense side of the income statement. And so, we can\u2019t give up on either one. Marty Mosby : And then one tactical question, David you had $30 million negative in prepayment write-offs, we\u2019re getting about half of that back in the fourth quarter, but if rates stay where they are at or at what level do you have to get to get the other $6 million back into your quarterly NII from prepayments going back to where they were in the prior quarter? David Turner : Yes, I think where we are clearly is beneficial we obviously have seen a lot of volatility though in rates and I think that you are right, we will get a piece of that back naturally because of what that\u2019s happened. But I think that it\u2019s going to be it\u2019s a little premature to say when we might get that other piece and we need to see what will happen over maybe the next couple of quarters before we can get our previously premium amortization down into the lower 40 range. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Grayson Hall : Good afternoon Erika. Erika Najarian : Good afternoon. I apologize in advance for prolonging the call on one more expense question. But I just wanted to make sure I understood David\u2019s response to Betsy\u2019s question correctly. The way it was framed was the core run rate for expenses was 880 to 885 plus potentially a natural growth rate of 2% to 3% should we then on top of that separately think about the $400 million of savings and that $400 million is being used to fund all those investments that you\u2019ve been talking about for the past hour. David Turner : So, I think if you look at our kind of core that 880 to 885 is where we are, we do continue to make investments to grow our revenue. So an example will be our release we had yesterday, you\u2019ll see expenses coming through from that investment in 2017 and none in 2016. And so we are trying figure out how to pay for that by having other saving. So part of that $400 million is compensators for that. We do have built-in natural inflation that we have, salary increases and alike that we try to curtail by insuring that we have the right number of people, the right number the right kinds of the people to manage our business and run our businesses. We are down some 1,200 people. We continue to challenge ourselves on that and we see some of that manifest in the branch consolidations that we\u2019ve had during the year. So, the question is how do we keep to 880 and 885 is stable to up modestly as we can, while we are making the investments to grow revenue and having things like First Sterling with 12 months worth of expense next year virtually none in 2016. So, does that make sense? Erika Najarian : It does, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Grayson Hall : Afternoon, Kevin. Kevin Barker : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one follow-up not to beat the dead horse, follow-up on expenses again, you said you\u2019re flat to up modest on a yearly basis, I mean that could be a very wide range going into the fourth quarter. Are you assuming that the run rate is going to be closer to the 880 to 885 range during going into the fourth quarter or is it going to be -- could you see some volatility where that could drive that number lower? David Turner : No we believe that's our core kind of run rate where we are right now for the fourth quarter is a net 880 to 885. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then when you think about the revenue side when you say it\u2019s going to be on a yearly basis up around 6% or more than 6% it\u2019s a run rate closer to $500 million going into the next quarter from $544 million. But it seems like you have a lot of positive commentary around on your momentum on the fee income side. It seems like that number could be up a lot higher than the 6% that you're guiding too. Is there some moving parts there that may cause the number to come down considerably going into the fourth quarter? David Turner : No we've had we grew just about every category of non-interest revenue. And we're excited about those investments that are paying off that we\u2019ve paid. So I don't see that the 6% the reason we left there is our initial target at Investor Day was 4% to 6%. We had said we\u2019d be in the middle, then we said we'd be at the upper end and now we're giving you guidance that we\u2019ll be over 6%. But that's where we stop and we haven't we\u2019re letting you draw your own conclusion as to what percentage you want to use over that. But there is nothing that indicates to us that we have any type of major disruption in that trend that you're seeing. Kevin Barker : Okay, thanks for taking the questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Grayson Hall : Good afternoon, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good afternoon, Grayson good afternoon, David. Couple of questions for you, David you touched on the premium amortization and how it's going to improve obviously in the next quarter and in earlier question you talked a little bit about maybe getting even better if rates go higher. Can you quantify where rates would have to go the tenure government bond yield that is where the premium amortization would really drop significantly and be a non-factor. David Turner : So I think if you took the tenure maybe up closure to 2% we might have some meaningful reduction in the premium amortization and that\u2019s just an approximate. Because obviously what happens with prepayments, refis and mortgages getting always totally correlated to the tenure. But suffice to say that\u2019s a pretty good proxy. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then on the other end if we were to see a higher level similar to what we saw this quarter would the tenure need to get closer to 160 or below for that to reoccur? David Turner : Yes I think that we're coming off of pretty historic lows in the second quarter. And when you look at that that's why we were able to give you maybe that $4 million that we don't think will repeat. But you'd have to be steady in the 150s for the quarter for it to get anywhere close to where it was. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, great. And then coming back to the capital question, obviously Grayson you talked about using the capital deployment for organic growth and strategic alternatives. And David you pointed out that you're comfortable with a CET 1 ratio at 9.5%, if the NPR turns into an actual regulation about the qualitative portion of CCAR you're not going to have to go through it anymore. Would you guys consider doing an accelerated share repurchase agreement in the next CCAR exam or a Dutch tender offer to really pull out a lot of excess capital to bring you down closer to your 9.5% and obviously the ROE would go higher? Grayson Hall : I'll let David add to this. But we do believe that the proposed rules are constructive and give us more certainly. And we do believe that given the risk profile of our company today as we run through CCAR that given the current mix that we think we\u2019re in that sort of 9.5% range as David said. Obviously we're trying to improve the mix of our portfolio that will change some of our metrics if we're successful in that regard. But the rules that are proposed give us more certainty, but we still it's our responsibility to manage capital and do that prudently and thoughtfully. And assuming the rules get approved in somewhat similar fashion as they stand today. I think it is constructive for our bank and constructive in general for a lot of regional banks and will give us more flexibility. All that being said is we're still sometime away from those strong deliberations that go into our submission. And so it's premature for us to comment on what we might or might not do in that regard. But it's a possibility. David Turner : So Gerard I would tell you it's really important that this 9.5% that's our number, that\u2019s our loss forecasting that's the way we go about measuring the kind of capital we need to have. We're not interested in pushing ourselves to the point we have a quantitative failure, and ask for a mulligan [ph] and all those kinds of things. I think it\u2019s important that we have a capital planning process, with the appropriate governance I am talking about the Board review that helps us establish capital based on the risk in our company. Today, we think that risk would indicate 9.5% common equity Tier 1 number. We are evaluating as Grayson mentioned, how we might change that risk profile to help us get the appropriate amount of capital that we have to keep. Now your question really is fine you\u2019re at 9.5%, you are at 11% you got to get 9.5%, how quick was the pace of change assuming the NPR turns in exactly as it is, and I think that's a great question. We\u2019re going to have a lot of thought put into that, especially after learning what we did last year from CCAR submissions. But I do think we need to be real careful about indicating this as some form of panacea, I do think that we need to be prudent, very careful of how we manage this capital because we have other players, we have shareholders, we have other third parties that are looking at how we think about capital too. So being very thoughtful about it, and looking at that pace, we want to go at the pace that\u2019s fairly and reasonable for all interested parties. And so a lot of work needs to be done. Gerard Cassidy : Gentlemen, thank you for your insights there, appreciate it. David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Grayson Hall : Good afternoon, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Let me just follow-up on that capital discussion a little bit with both of you. David, to your point about, yes it\u2019s going to take time obviously to go from 11% to 9.5% and Grayson, you\u2019ve been doing the bolt-on acquisition, but they have not really used up that much capital and you\u2019ve done a bunch of these, given how much you\u2019re generating. So as you look into 2017 and I recognize you can\u2019t do this right now, but looking to something where do other uses of capital, how would prioritize them? Returning more than 100% versus say bank acquisitions? David Turner : Yes, so Vivek you\u2019re bringing up a good point in terms of capital deployment, let\u2019s go through that how we think about it. First and foremost is organic growth, but as organic growth on things that add to the return hurdle that we\u2019re trying to get to which is growing to 12% to 14% return on tangible common equity. So what we laid at Investor Day is where we are today. We\u2019re going to update that in December. So to the extent that\u2019s not there, and we continue to generate capital that we\u2019re not utilizing having an appropriate dividend that we have is important to us, bolt-on acquisitions it help. You\u2019re right, they don\u2019t have a tendency to use a lot of capital. And then outside of that returning it to the shareholders and exceeding 100% payout ratio has been done. I think that\u2019s a learning that we picked this past year and we would consider that as well. You mentioned bank acquisitions, when you look at valuation for us, right now we have our CRA issue that we hope gets cleared up, but we really have to get those two things dealt with before we can really start looking at it from a valuation standpoint and that is isn\u2019t very supportive of that at this juncture. Grayson Hall : And even then I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear, I mean we\u2019re very interested in non-bank bolt-on acquisitions, we\u2019ve active in that they will come at times when bank related bolt-on acquisitions matter, will be of interest when valuations improve and I think that we look at that and we try to understand that. I think that right now, that\u2019s just not our primary focus for -- as David mentioned for a couple of reasons as well as others. And so our focus on organic growth, our focus on improving the fundamentals of our company and our focus on bolt-on acquisitions that while they don\u2019t consume a lot of capital. They also don\u2019t add a lot of risk to our company that it\u2019s the integration, the synergies that we create, we got the ability to do that, we\u2019re pretty good at it. We think we could continue to do that. Hopefully, overtime we can even increase the pace of this kind of activity. When it does it\u2019s a very manageable risk profile when we executed this way. Larger acquisitions obviously have a very different risk profile. And right now we're just focused on building a very sustainable franchise value for our shareholders. David Turner : I kind of had one other thing I should have mentioned is we do as we think about our 12% to 14% target in terms of return on tangible common equity. We're working on the numerators as we\u2019ve just talked about for a little over hour and half. But also managing the denominator in terms of our capital base and getting to our target is important in that calculation. So I think we're all we get the message and as the pace as back to Gerard\u2019s question the pace of how we get there just needs to be done in a responsible manner. And we need a little more time to think how that might look. Vivek Juneja : Okay. I have a small one for Barb, thank you for that. And Barb what was the NPL ratio on energy loans last quarter? Your slide had 12% what is it this quarter? Barbara Godin : Give me a second, 13%. Thank you. Vivek Juneja : Okay. That was with the addition of those five NPLs? Barbara Godin : That\u2019s right. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great thanks. Thank you. Operator : We have time to one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners Research. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, good afternoon. I guess just kind of going back to part of what Gerard was asking about. Do you think given the changes on the margin a positive and expenses also a positive heading into the near future. Should we be pay more attention to return on tangible equity or returned assets, which would be more appropriate to kind gauge the progress with Regions? David Turner : Well so we look at both. We do when you kind of look at the regress the return on tangible common the stock price and valuation is pretty tight correlation. So we have the tendency to focus on return on tangible common. It also forces us to make sure we have an appropriate capital base for our business model. So while ROA is important you'll see businesses and peers that have more revenue generated from non-balance sheets non-assets always have a higher ROA. But I think that whether rubber meets the road is really returns on the capital. Grayson Hall : I'd add to that I think also we monitor pretty gross the growth in the absolute value of tangible common equity not just the return, but how much of our tangible common equity is improving. Christopher Marinac : Great, guys. Thank you very much we appreciate it. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Grayson Hall : No further remarks. Just want to thank you for your time and your participation and your comments, questions. Thank you we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Participating on the call are Grayson Hall, Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also present and available to answer questions. A copy of the slide presentation referenced throughout this call as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. I would also like to caution you that we will make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risk and uncertainties and we will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as well as GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are detailed in our SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, Dana and good morning. Thank you for joining our call today. I will review highlights of our full year financial performance and David will cover results for the fourth quarter specifically. Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with 2016 results. We diligently executing our strategic plan and maintained our focus on our business fundamentals. Central to our success has been the continued emphasis on three strategic initiatives, growing and diversifying revenue, practicing disciplined expense management and effectively deploying our capital. Net income available to common shareholders in 2016 was $1.1 billion, a 10% increase of 2015. Earnings per share was $0.87, representing a 16% increase over the prior year. Total taxable equivalent revenue grew 3% and reported non-interest expenses were relatively flat. And like 2015, we laid out financial targets for 2016. Although the operating environment proved somewhat more challenging than anticipated or forecasted, we still met or exceeded most of our performance targets, for example we grew net interest income 3% versus the prior year. We also grew adjusted non-interest income 7%, driven by growth in construction relationships and new product offerings. For example, through newer enhanced products and capabilities, capital markets income increased 46% in 2016 and wealth management income increased 6% Adjusted non-interest expenses increased just under 2%, in line with our target of flat to up modestly. Importantly, we generated positive operating leverage, which is a critical metric as part of our focus to an adjusted basis of 3% and adjusted full year efficiency ratio was 63.3%. Finally, full year net charge-offs totaled 34 basis points. Regarding loan growth, 2016 presented some unique challenges which we tackled head-on and we were intentional and thoughtful in how we managed our portfolio. Average loans were relatively stable in fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year. Notably, the overall financial health of our consumer portfolio was strong and we saw solid demand and stable loan growth in almost all consumer loan categories. Average consumer loans grew $1.2 billion or 4% from the fourth quarter of prior year. On the other hand, average business lending balances declined 3% from the fourth quarter of prior year. This decline was driven by our continued focus and a thoughtful focus on achieving appropriate risk adjusted returns, the de-risking of certain portfolios and asset classes and the ongoing softness in demand for middle market commercial and small business loans. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by recent increases in market interest rates as well as possible benefits associated with the new administration. We remain focused on improving efficiencies. Our plan to eliminate $400 million a core expenses through 2019 remains firmly intact. This, along with our continued focus on appropriate risk adjusted returns, are fundamental to our long-term success and sustainability of our franchise value. With respect to capital deployment, we remain committed to effectively deploying our capital through organic growth and strategic investments that increase revenue or reduced ongoing expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of capital to shareholders. In the year 2016, we returned $1.2 billion of our earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, while at the same time maintaining robust and industry leading capital loans. On a separate note, we are pleased that our satisfactory CRA rating has been reinstated. We remain committed to optimizing our branch network and we will optimistically expand and serve in select growth markets. In year 2016 we consolidated 103 branches and announced plans to consolidate another 23 offices. As presently announced, our plan is to consolidate at least 150 branch offices by the end of 2017. In closing, I want to thank our team of 22,000 associates for their hard work and dedication in delivering solid financial results and their continued commitment to superior customer service. We are extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2016 and are well positioned to build on that momentum in 2017. With that, I will turn it over to David to cover the specific details of the fourth quarter. David? David Turner : Thank you Grayson and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and look at average loans. In the fourth quarter, average loan balances totaled $80.6billion, down 1% from the previous quarter and relatively flat with the fourth quarter of 2015. Consumer lending remains a positive story for us as we experienced another quarter of solid growth. Average balances increased $329 million or 1% over the prior quarter and $1.2 billion or 4% over the prior year. This growth was led by mortgage lending as balances increased $236 million or 2% linked quarter and $732 million or 6% over the same quarter of the prior year. We made the decision to sell $171 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans to Freddie Mac during the fourth quarter and generated a gain of $5 million. Approximately $91 million of these loans included recourse and will remain in loans held for sale at year-end until the recourse expires later in 2017. Subsequent to the expiration of recourse provisions, it is expected that an additional $5 million gain will be recognized. The economics of the transaction and improved diversification drove the decision to sell. We continued to experience success with our other indirect lending portfolio which includes point of sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $110 million or 14% linked quarter and $366 million or 70% year-over-year. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $36 million or 3% over the prior quarter and $115 million or 11% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.4%, an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year. Turning to the indirect auto portfolio. Average balances decreased $17 million during the quarter. As previously disclosed, we terminated a third party arrangement during the fourth quarter that historically accounted for approximately one-half of our total indirect vehicle production. As such, we expect the pace of run-off in the portfolio to exceed production generated by our preferred dealer network. Average home equity balances also decreased $64 million as the pace of run-off exceeded production. Now turning to business lending. Average balances decreased $1 billion or 2% during the quarter and $1.4 billion or 3% year-over-year. As Grayson mentioned, the decline in business lending balances was impacted by our continued focus on achieving appropriate balance and diversity while also improving risk-adjusted returns. Importantly, balances reflect decisions and choices that we made during the year. We continued to reduce exposure due to concerns about increasing risk in certain industries and asset classes. Average direct energy loans decreased $491 million or 19% and average multi-family loans decreased $239 million or 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Further, continued softness in demand and increasing competition for middle market small business loans has also impacted loan production. While there have been headwinds to business lending growth in 2016, we continue to expect low single digit average loan growth in 2017. Areas within business lending expected to contribute to this growth include, technology and defense, healthcare, power and utilities and asset-based lending. We will start with deposits. Total average deposit balances increased $561 million from the previous quarter and $1 billion year-over-year. Average low cost deposits increased $503 million and $1.3 billion over the same respective periods. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 13 basis points and total funding costs remain low totaling 30 basis points in the quarter. Total average deposits in the consumer segment were up $452 million or 1% in the quarter and $2.7 billion or 5% year-over-year. This growth reflects the unique strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits. Average corporate segment deposits increased $437 million or 2% during the quarter and $1.2 billion or 4% year-over-year as corporate customers remain focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the wealth management segment decreased $398 million or 4% during the quarter and $2.3 billion or 18% year-over-year. Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits which require collateralization by securities continue to shift out of deposits and into other fee income producing customer investments. So let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $874 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $18 million or 2% from the third quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.1, 6%, an increase of 10 basis points. Both net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income benefited from several factors during the quarter, including higher interest rates, lower premium amortization on investment securities, a leveraged lease residual value adjustment incurred in the third quarter that did not repeat and higher security balances. These increases were partially offset by lower loan balances. Net interest margin also benefited from lower average cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The increase in interest rates during the quarter reduced the amount of premium amortization on mortgage-related securities to $43 million from $49 million and premium amortization is expected to decline further in the first quarter of 2017. Now, if interest rates remain at current levels or continue to rise, we would expect the benefit from marginal declines in premium amortization ultimately achieving the quarterly run rate in the low to mid $30 million range in 2017. Non-interest income decreased 13% in the quarter primarily due to insurance proceeds related to the FHA settlement recognized in the third quarter. Non-interest income increased $8 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 6% in the quarter, but increased 2% year-over-year. Service charges increased 4% in the quarter. However, this growth was more than offset by declines in capital markets, wealth management, mortgage and other non-interest income. Following a record third quarter, capital markets income decreased $11 million or 26% during the quarter, driven primarily by lower merger and acquisition advisory services. Capital markets income increased $3 million or 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by increased debt underwriting activity. Also coming off a record third quarter, wealth management income decreased $4 million or 4% as lower insurance and investment services income were only partially offset by higher investment management trust fees. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, wealth management income increased $3 million or 3% as growth in investment management trust fees exceeded the decline in investment services while insurance income was unchanged. Mortgage income decreased $3 million or 7% driven by a seasonally lower production, partially offset by increases in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 59% was related to purchase activity and 41% was related to refinancing. Mortgage income increased 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased gains associated with a 29% increase in production. Also during the quarter, we completed another bulk purchase of the rights to service approximately $2.2 billion of mortgage loans. This brings our total purchases from 2016 to approximately $8.1 billion and our mortgage servicing portfolio has increased $6 billion to $45 billion. Mortgage servicing income increased $5 million or 6% in 2016 compared to 2015. We still have capacity and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio. And finally, other non-interest income declined during the quarter as the company recognized a recovery during the third quarter of approximately $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which did not repeat this quarter. So let's talk about expenses. Total non-interest expenses decreased 4% during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $877 million also representing a 4% decrease quarter-over-quarter reflecting the results of our efficiency initiatives. Total salaries and benefits decreased $14 million from the third quarter, primarily due to a decline in base salaries associated with one less weekday, the impact of staffing reductions and lower production base incentives related to decreased capital markets and commercial banking production. Staffing levels continued to decline during the quarter and decreased 5% or over 1,200 positions in 2016 as we execute on our efficiency initiatives. Professional and legal expenses decreased $3 million during the quarter primarily due to lower litigation-related costs. We also recognized an $11 million linked quarter benefit associated with credit for unfunded commitments. And finally, recall there was an $11 million expense in the third quarter associated with Visa Class B shares that did not repeat in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.2% and as Grayson mentioned we remain committed to achieving our expense elimination plans and our long-term target to an adjusted efficiency ratio below 60% by 2018. The company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 was 31.2% and 30.7% respectively and the effective tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range for the full year 2017. Let's move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $83 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $29 million from the third quarter and represented 41 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our direct energy portfolio totaled $14 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $35 million less in net charge-offs and our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans decreased three basis points to 1.36%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.9% in the third quarter, which reflects continued improvement in credit quality of the energy book and our exposure to direct energy continued to decline ending the year at 2.6% of total loans outstanding. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased nine basis points to 1.24% of loans outstanding and total business services criticized loans decreased 3%. The improvement in business services criticized loans was primarily due to declines in energy and energy-related credits. The improvement in non-accrual loans was driven by declines in non-energy commercial loans. Troubled debt restructured loans increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to increases in indirect energy credits. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 110% at quarter end. Excluding energy, the coverage ratio increased from 123% to 138% in the fourth quarter. Direct energy charge-offs totaled $37 million in 2016 and are expected to be less than $40 million in 2017 given current market conditions. Now under a stress scenario with oil averaging below $25 per barrel, incremental losses could total $100 million over the next eight quarters. We are encouraged by the performance of our energy portfolio to-date. However, we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. Given where we are in the credit cycle and considering fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits. Let's talk about capital liquidity. As Grayson mentioned, we returned $1.2 billion of our 2016 earnings to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, our capital ratios remain robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11% and we were also fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule at the end of the year and our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan deposit ratio of 81%. So as we look ahead in terms of 2017, the targets that we laid out are as follows. We expect full year average loans and average deposits to grow in the low single digits. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income growth is in the 2% to 4% range. And our adjusted non-interest income is expected to grow 3% to 5%. From expense standpoint, total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2017 are expected to increase between zero and 1% and we expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 62% with positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. From a credit standpoint, full year net charge-offs are expected to be 35 to 50 basis points. So in closing, our solid 2016 results reflect the successful execution of our strategic plan and our commitment to our three primary strategic initiatives which are growing and diversifying our revenue streams, practicing disciplined expense management and effectively deploying our capital. We are pleased to end the year on a positive note and believe we have the right team and the right strategy to deliver and create further shareholder value in 2017. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, please limit your questions to one primary question and one follow-up. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo. Grayson Hall : Good morning Matt Matt Burnell : Good morning Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned a couple of times, the momentum in the commercial side of the business. And I want to focus a little bit on the small and medium size borrowers. And obviously the competition there has been very, very intense, but do you sense a greater level of optimism from your customers that might increase their desire to borrow over the next year or two presuming we get a little bit of benefit in the economy? And then I have a bigger picture question for my follow up. Grayson Hall : Absolutely. I will make a few comments and then I will ask John Turner who manages that part of business for us to make his comments as well. Absolutely, we are seeing anecdotally in our conversations with our customers a lot more confidence and a lot more optimism about what the future would hold. And we continue to believe that at some point that turns in to more business activity than we have seen thus far. But that being said, we are still not seeing that enthusiasm turn into actual lending activity. Line utilization is still not showing signs of that enthusiasm turning into activity nor are we seeing applications of credits do that. But having said that, I can't underscore enough the amount of optimism we hear in the voices of our customers. But I think it's going to take some time yet for that to result in a lot of economic activity. John, if you would? John Turner : Yes. Thanks Grayson. I just would add and reiterate, we are hearing a more positive outlook from our customers, but we are not seeing that translate into new opportunities yet. Pipelines are up a little. Line utilization is down about 90 basis points in the quarter. We are having meaningful conversations with customers, but none of that has yet resulted in their desire to increase business fixed investment, which ultimately is what we need to see growth. Matt Burnell : That's okay. Thanks. Grayson Hall : You have a follow-up question. Matt Burnell : Yes. My question really relates to the deposit rates which actually went down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, which was a little bit better than we have seen at some of your competitors. Do you attribute that to just the location of your franchise? Or is there something else going on there? And then maybe an update on your thinking of deposit beta as rates rise and where you are now relative to sort of your longer-term assumptions? Grayson Hall : Well, I think Matt, when you look at our franchise, the real competitive advantage we have is really as a deposit gathering franchise. That's where the real value of our bank is at. And if you look at our deposit portfolio, it's a very granular portfolio and about 50% of that portfolio is located in smaller community markets and if you look at our thoughts and our forecast, you see a very conservative beta forecast for interest rate increases. Candidly, the environment we are coming from right now, we have never seen before. So this is new coming from this interest rate environment to start to increase. We are optimistic that our deposit betas will provide an advantage for us and thus far, as you mentioned, our deposit costs has remained relatively low. I think we are up one basis point quarter-over-quarter. So we think we have done a very good job actually growing deposits in the face of that activity. David, you might ay want to add to that. David Turner : Yes. It's a great question, Matt, because as Grayson mentioned, this is really our competitive advantage that we have been waiting to see come through in our income statement. As Grayson mentioned, the deposit make up that we have really resulted in last upcycle. We have one of the lower betas than any other peers. I think we are internally at about 54%, was our beta. Perhaps it will be higher because we are at historical lows and so we model a 60% beta as the terminal value. But we start sow in that 40% range and we think that's really going to be important. Deposit rates, we think the faster rates increase from the Fed, the more pressure there will be. But what's happened thus far, as we haven't had nor have many in the industry had to pass much through to deposit holders because we have had increases one-off. So we are looking forward to dealing with that. We have great liquidity and a great stable funding base that we think can create value for our shareholders in 2017 and beyond. Matt Burnell : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Grayson Hall : Good morning Michael. Michael Rose : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a question for David on the margins. I am sorry if I missed this. But can you quantify the impact of premium amortization on the margin this quarter? And then maybe just some greater context as to what your forecast includes? Does it include a couple of rate hikes, I assume? And what would it look like if we didn't get any rate hikes? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So you saw our change in premium amortization early on. It was about a point difference on that in terms of margin. Clearly, the increase in rates was a big driver for us and that is not just the Fed move really LIBOR starting to move in advance of that as well as the tenure. So that's very helpful to us as our sensitivity continues to be on the longer end. Today the short end is probably 42% of our sensitivity and 58% in the middle to the back end. So as we think about increases for this next year, we are closer to where the market is right now, which was having a rate increase sometime in the summer and maybe one towards the back end of the year. We realized what Chair Yellen said the other day with regards to supporting the dot plots and perhaps there is an incremental increase baked into that. But we don't forecast that. If we get that, then that's better for us, but our guidance that we just laid out really shows that increase sometime in the summer and then towards back end of the fourth quarter. Michael Rose : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe as my follow-up, if you can just give some color on some of the major fee income businesses, given the guide? I know capital markets was down, I guess greater than I expected sequentially. And maybe if you can just give the outlook for some of the businesses for this year? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So we have a good story for non-interest income. Clearly, there's a lot of seasonality that hits that space. You can see that manifest throughout the industry. Same thing for us. In particular, we came off a lot of really strong third quarter in a number of areas, capital markets and wealth management. We believe those rebound and that's why we have our guidance for non-interest revenue growth of 3% to 5% next year. We went into this year with a 4% to 6% expectation. We ended up growing 7%. So we feel confident about our ability to grow in that 3% to 5% range. It will be a contribution from all those line items that you have seen in the past, as we continue to just grow customers and continue to build out certain of our new platforms like BlackArch Partners. Michael Rose : That's great color. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Grayson Hall : Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. How are you? Grayson Hall : Doing well. Betsy Graseck : Great. I had a couple of questions. One was on the progress around the capital markets, investments that you are doing in the treasury management investments. I was wondering how you think those are going to come through as you go through 2017? John Turner : Betsy, this is John Turner. I would say we are very pleased with the investments we have made. Capital markets revenue was up 44% last year in 2016. We did see obviously some decline in the fourth quarter, but that business is going to be uneven. The M&A advisory fee income that we enjoyed was more front end loaded into the second and third quarter. And as we look forward to 2017, we face some headwinds in a few of our newer initiatives like the low income housing tax credit platform that we acquired, CMBS platform that we have established. The conditions in the market aren't great for those today, but we think they will ultimately work themselves out. We feel very good about the initiatives and the investments and expect to continue to grow capital markets revenue and treasury management revenue in 2017 at a pretty good pace. Betsy Graseck : I mean the rising rate environment should be good for treasury management, I would expect? John Turner : It will be and remember that if you look at our deposit growth, we grew deposits by over $1.2 billion in the corporate bank and that's really a reflection of our focus on relationships, building broader and deeper relationships with our customers and winning more treasury management business than we have in the past. And so I think you will continue to see that growth. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then just second question on the cost save initiatives that you have been very clear about, the targets. Could you give us a sense as to how the efficiency will drop to the bottom line as you go through the year? Is there any kind of trajectory that we should expect? Is there back-end loaded or what? John Turner : Yes. I think if you look at rates, if the rate curve will hold you will start seeing even a better improvement as we get towards end of the year. We should start out having a pretty decent efficiency ratio contribution to that 62% that I talked to you about. But it gets even better at we get to the back end of the year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Grayson Hall : Good morning John. John Pancari : Good morning. Grayson, if you could just talk a little bit about the fact that you have gotten the satisfactory rating on the CRA, as you mentioned. Does that pave the way for you to consider acquisitions again? And if so, can you give us your updated appetite for whole bank deals and then non-bank deals? Thanks. Grayson Hall : John, I mean I think, first of all, we are very pleased to get our CRA rating reinstated back to satisfactory. The team here worked very hard to accommodate that. And so it's indicative of way we do business and the way we try to help our customers and all the communities we operate in. So very encouraged by that turn of events. What does that mean for us? We are very focused on organic growth. We are very focused on optimizing our distribution channels. You saw in 2016 that we invested in all of our channels, our online banking, our mobile banking, our contact centers, our ATMs and our branches. We had a number of consolidations in 2016 and opened relatively few branches in 2016. You can see that, but at the same time, we invested a tremendous amount of technology into those branches and changed our delivery format in a number of those offices to be more efficient and more effective. You will see us continue to do that. We think that it's an important and critical part of our franchise value and we think all of our distribution channels are important. The branch still has an awful lot of relevance and it is still the predominant channel that customer choose to open new accounts with us. So our primary focus is organic growth. When it comes to acquisition opportunities, we are very sensitive to what's going on in the market. We have a team inside the bank. It spends an awful lot of time monitoring markets and what's going on there. We look for opportunities to invest through acquisition. You saw last year that that was predominantly done through non-bank bolt-on acquisitions which has been predominantly our interest. We look at whole bank deals quite candidly. Where valuations are at right now, I think some of the economics of that we find challenging, but there may be opportunities for that. We are watching but our primary focus is on growing organically. So we will watch and see where the market goes, but at this particular point in time, we saw most of our opportunities in growing organically, in growing in non-bank bolt-on acquisitions and we are monitoring whole bank acquisition opportunities. Right now that market seems to be improving, but I think it's early yet. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately, I know you have mentioned that you are focusing increasingly on risk-adjusted returns and that, to a degree, has impacted your loan growth in the quarter and possibly your outlook. So I guess if you could just talk a little bit more about identifying those exact areas, exact portfolios where you are deliberately deemphasizing production as you are focusing on the risk-adjusted returns? Thanks. Grayson Hall : First of all, we recognize we are in a cyclical business and we have to be mindful of that as we establish our risk appetite across different lending segments and we spend an awful lot of time trying to adjust our risk appetite. It is based on where we think we are in the cycle of all of those different lending categories. We have signaled to you that we have throttled back on indirect auto. We throttled back to investor real estate construction. We have throttled back on multifamily, to a certain degree. But we are still in those businesses, still lending in those businesses and obviously the one business that we have been most cautious in is energy for apparent reasons. But we still are in all of these businesses. We are just being more thoughtful and more careful given where we are at in the cycle of that. But we also spend an awful lot of time on both business that we win and business that we lose. We compete in a lot of different markets against very large financial institutions and small community banks as well. And there is an awful lot of competition there and we are trying to be very thoughtful about what type of transactions we will do, what kind of risk adjusted return we can achieve in those and I think in this market, we are able to grow our business in asset classes that we think make a lot of sense. As David said, we believe for 2017, we will grow in the low single digits. But that is growing faster than that in sub-segments while constraining growth in some of the other segments. I think most of this discussion centers around some of our commercial lending activities. I will ask John Turner to make a few comments as well. John Turner : John, I think we have talked about, as an example, our focus on risk-adjusted returns in our shared national credit book and we have spent a lot of time there this year as a result of what we will refer to as recycling activity where we have exited some relationships and entered new ones. We have seen the level of credit only shared national credits come down by about 16%. The revenues that we are generating per relationship in those newer relationships go up by 35%. They generate over 100% more non-interest revenue and the risk-adjusted returns are 220 basis points greater than those relationships that we exited. In addition to that, I talked about deposit growth. We saw fee income growth in the business and the overall risk adjusted return on the corporate banking business here at Regions inclusive of all three businesses is up 160 basis points year-over-year. And at the same time, we think we have a better quality loan portfolio as we are de-risking the business and adding better risk and getting an appropriate return. We think that our commitment to profitable growth and appropriate returns is paying off and we will continue to see that in the coming quarters. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. Grayson Hall : John, good morning. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning guys. David, I wanted to follow up on the net interest income margin question. Is there a rule of thumb that we can use, in terms of as we try to model Fed hikes for you guys, how much each Fed hike of 25 basis points adds to net interest margin? Any rough rule of thumb there? David Turner : Well, we have tried to give you the parallel shift of 100 basis points, it's about $160 million right now and then we are 42% on the short end of that. If you do some quick math, depending on beta assumption you want to use, you are talking about $15 million, maybe $20 million on an annual basis. And again deposit beta assumption makes a difference. John McDonald : Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the efficiency, the target this year, the 62%, At a conference in December you guys laid out longer term kind of sub-60% and I think you said by 2018. Is that the right way to think about, that you could go from 62% to 60% by the end of 2018? Does that imply a real ramp up in the expense saves next year? David Turner : Well, so we can get to the 60s. That's our commitment by the end of 2018, kind of on a run rate basis there. So you will see us continuing to chip away at it each and every quarter through 2018 so that by the time we get we are hitting the 60% and below target that we laid out. And then by the time we get there, we will reassess and give you our new target because over time we think we will be even south of that. But let's get to the below 60% first and we will reestablish that. John McDonald : Okay. Fair enough. Operator : We will proceed to the next question which comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Grayson Hall : Hello Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. It looks like there was quite a bit of strength in service charges this quarter. I wondered if you could elaborate on what happened there? David Turner : Yes. I am not sure what you are looking at from a stress standpoint. Service charges continued to be fairly strong for us. Geoffrey Elliott : No, I said strengths, not stress. David Turner : I am sorry. We heard stress. Okay. Geoffrey Elliott : Maybe it's the British accent or something. David Turner : Sorry. What's really strong, we have such a strong retail network, continuing to grow customers is important and you are seeing that manifest itself in service charges. We have also had increases in customers on the commercial side as well. So if you look at year-over-year, we are kind of flat, but we were overcoming obstacles last year on posting order and we expect service charge to continue to be robust in 2017. Grayson Hall : No. We thought we have done a really good job in our consumer bank. And if you look at growth metrics across accounts and account activity and the quality of the accounts we are placing on our books, we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making. And as we do that, it really improve the number of revenue streams. Geoffrey Elliott : And if the economy strengthens, how does that impact this? Do people make less use of overdraft if they are feeling better off? Or the dynamics is kind of more complex? David Turner : From my perspective, there is certain people that's what happens and these aren't all overdrafts, by the way. These are core service charges that are monthly maintenance fees and those things. So stronger economy, we don't think would do anything but help that. It is really the customer growth that we continue to have that we think is most impactful to that line item and the more robust economy where the outreach that we want to do to continue to expand the franchise and grow relationships, we think that could be a positive for us in 2017. Grayson Hall : Yes. And what we have seen, when you look at the consumer base, we really have started really shift in the mix of fee income in our consumer book towards more around activity based, in particular on debit cards and credit cards and less reliance on overdraft activity. And as you look at our checking account features, we have introduced a number of new products that give customers more assurance, more safety. They transact the business in the correct way and so we feel real good about our offerings. We feel good about our growth and we think 2017, you will continue to see this sort of pace and momentum that we have really started generating in 2016. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Ken Usdin : Dave, I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about just total balance sheet size. I think we understand the expectation for loan and deposit growth. You guys have been at a pretty comfortable level of securities and it sounded like you did a little bit more remixing. So is it fair to say that you are comfortable at kind of that this level of earning assets? Or what would drive the total size of the balance sheet from here unless you started to just take on some wholesale funding? David Turner : Yes. It's a great question, Ken. Part of what we did this year is, we were looking at certain of our deposit products. We talked about the collateralized deposits that were in our wealth management group. Those weren't providing virtually any liquidity value for us and certain of those were more expensive. And so we decided that we would move those out of the bank. And so if you look at deposit balances, you really need to go through the supplemental page 22 and see what the make up is because we had good deposit growth in consumer and in business services over the corporate bank segment. As we think about next year, low single digit growth relative to loans and deposits. We think earning assets can grow in that 2% range. And we know that didn't happen this year, but we think that that can happen as we go through 2017. Ken Usdin : Okay. I have got it. And would that increment be then, but you did issue a bunch more debt in the fourth quarter, would that be also funded by more debt issuance this year? David Turner : Yes. Those were really FHLB advances and what we are expecting our continued deposit growth to fund our activities on the left side of balance sheet. Ken Usdin : Okay. And just one follow-up on the securities portfolio. Outside of the premium amortization help to securities yields, I am just wondering how close are you to kind of getting to that back book, front book in terms of just new yields on new purchases versus what's rolling off the book? David Turner : Yes. So we have talked about where things settle down a little bit on premium amortization being closer to that treasury yield of 275 and that we would settle on premium amortization. Premium amortization will settle in that mid $30 million range, but going on today, it is about to 250 in terms of the mortgage backed as corporates are about a point higher than that. And so we continue to see further benefit from rising rates on that portfolio primarily through the slowing down of premium amortization. Ken Usdin : Okay. David Turner : So the new securities that we are putting on are accretive to our cause. Ken Usdin : Right. Outside of the premium benefit, they are now accretive to the underlying. David Turner : That's right. Ken Usdin : Okay. I got it. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning Matt. Rob Hansen : Hi guys. This is Rob from Matt's team. Just had a follow-up on your outlook for commercial loan growth. I was just curious, how much additional balance reductions we should expect in those specific commercial segments such as energy and multi-family? Or you guys just about done at this point in terms of balance reduction there? John Turner : This is John Turner again. I would say that we expect the run-off in energy to begin to moderate. We will certainly have some continued paydowns as some of the problem credits work themselves out. But there is good stability in that marketplace. We are seeing asset sales occur. We are seeing opportunities, though limited thus far, to potentially lend into the space. And we did actually make two new E&P loans in 2016, one toward the end of the year. So I think we will see runoff moderate. With respect to multi-family, remember we are trying to change our mix of business from being primarily construction oriented to a better mix of construction and term and we can't match the timing. And so what we are seeing is run-off in the construction book as our term lending initiative is getting some traction and so we have had more run off in that portfolio than we anticipated. At some point it will bottom out and begin to grow as the term loan initiative picks up. And again, we are projecting 2% to 4% loan growth in 2017. We think that will come in some measure from our specialized lending groups where we can lean into the expertise that we have in technology, defense and healthcare and power and utilities as an example. And also within our Regions business capital croup, where we think we have an awfully good level of expertise and opportunity to grow our business. Rob Hansen : Okay. Thanks. And just separately on the net interest margin. Any color on where you see the consolidated NIM coming in for 1Q? I know you have some benefit from premium AM, but any other puts and takes? Will you see additional benefit from the December rate hike this quarter as well? David Turner : Yes. This is David. From a NIM standpoint, we still will get the benefit of lower rates now for the full quarter, which we think will be meaningful and we will pick up a couple of points with lower premium amortization as well. But don't dismiss the impact of two less days in the quarter, which actually is accretive to the NIM and that will be two to three points in and of itself. So as you think about where we might be in the first quarter, we could be up in that low to 3.20%, in the low 3.20s then and continuing to improve, if the rate environment will hold, if it were to improve from there towards the fourth quarter. Rob Hansen : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Marsh from FBR. Steve Marsh : Good morning. I was wondering on capital deployment here. Maybe just give us a little more color as to what you think about how aggressive you could be for your 2017 CCAR ask. David Turner : So we go through a very deliberate thoughtful process on capital deployment. You saw that this past year where we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders, which was more than our earnings at the end of the day. We will continue to -- it's important for us to get our capital optimized. One of our key metrics that we talk about is getting to that 12% to 14% return on tangible common equity in 2018 and to do that we have to have an optimal size of capital for the risk attendant in our balance sheet. And so, clearly, we have had a challenge of that capital base being strong as it is where loans were this past year. So we will be evaluating that in our submission and I think we learned a few things through other submissions this past year on others that had capital returns in excess of 100% of earnings. And I think that we will make a prudent decision. Again, our primary focus is to ensure, first and foremost, that we have the right amount of capital to run the company. And then that excess capital, we need to use that appropriately. Grayson talk about organic growth, the bolt-on acquisitions and when those don't use up the capital base, returning it to the shareholders is the right thing to do and we will continue to do that through our planning. Grayson Hall : But again, I would just reiterate that our primary desire is to be able to use the capital we generate to grow our business and serve our customers organically and as we use our team internally to put together our capital plan this year for approval by our Board. A lot of what we decide to do will be based on our outlook that we have for potential organic growth. And if we, depending on our outlook, it will drive really what we do to deploy capital otherwise. Steve Marsh : Okay. And then my follow-up question with regard to your loan loss reserve ratio. It's been coming down last couple of quarters. I am kind of wondering where you think you could fill out by year-end? Barbara Godin : This is Barbara Godin. Again, as you know we go through a very thoughtful process on setting the reserve for loan losses. As we continue to see the energy portfolio improve, I would say you will also continue to see some improvement in that level of reserve. I will reiterate what I said in the past, I never see it going back down to that 1% level. At some point, it will probably bottom out somewhere in that 1.25% or so. Steve Marsh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your branch rationalization strategy, especially in the context of what is your competitive strength, your low-cost funding. It's a pretty sizable reduction and your branch footprint is probably more geared, on average, in lesser competitive markets that obviously gives you a very strong low-cost funding. But when you think about your branch rationalization strategy, where you cut, how do you think about that? What are some of the variables you look at? And how do you ensure you are not cutting into your strengths? And I guess as an adjunct to that, how should we think about the economic benefit you get from the branch closures, the 150 branches or so? Is there a way to systematically think about how that flows through to your bottom line? Grayson Hall : Well, first, it's a very thoughtful data driven process because we are looking at all of our markets, how each branch is performing, where their transaction activity in that branch is growing or declining. You hear a lot of institutions talk about average growth rates, average decline rates of transactions. Those averages can be very deceptive, because we have branches where transactions continue to grow year-after-year. But what we have done is try to take a very facts based data driven process to determine where we have opportunities to not only consolidate offices, but to serve our customers even better. And so we look very closely at proximity of our branch offices to where our customers live and work. We spend an awful lot of time making sure that we do this the right way. We believe the branches are still very relevant. We still believe that there is opportunities to rationalize that particular distribution channel. But we have to be careful in how it fits in with all of our other channels and make sure that at the end of the day we are still able to attract and retain and service customers with excellence. So John, all of these branches report to you. If you would sort of speak to that? John Turner : Sure Grayson. Just to kind of level set, if you step back for a minute, we peaked about 10 years ago in 2007 with 2,127 branches. We are down 600 branches. We are down 28%, which is really more than anybody else in the industry. A couple of drivers there. You talked about proximity and things like that. That is a big part of it. The other part of it is, we have made a lot of investments in mobile and online banking and really driving those transactions out of the branches into what I will call service transaction. So check your balance, make a deposit, move money around, pay bills. So a lot of those things have been moved really out of the branches and moved to the mobile and online banking platform. The other comment I would make is, we have done a lot of work around, what we call, universal banker. And universal banker really has helped us from a productivity standpoint by allowing us to have staffing at reduced levels in our branches. I would tell you, for 2016 between our 130 branch consolidations and our universal banker strategy, we reduced about 800 positions just resulting from those two items. So it really is a balance. So we take a balanced approach around what we are doing in mobile and online, what we are doing with our DepositSmart ATM strategy, what we are doing with our virtual terminal strategy and also consolidations. I will tell you over the next, probably a year or two, you will see consolidations outpace any building. So our net branch count will go down from the 1,527 level today. We will probably be in that, I would say, 1,480 to 1,500 range. But again these branches are very important as part of our strategy. David Turner : This is David. I will add one thing for your last part of your question is that when we look at this from an economic standpoint, we consolidate a branch, we are going to lose some revenue. So the goal is to take out more cost than any revenue that you might lose. And for us, we target about a two year payback and when we consolidate these branches thus far, the wave that we have had, the 103 this year, once last year, been slightly less than the two year payback. So we feel very good about how they are paying for themselves. And it's a part of our expense initiatives as well. Grayson Hall : The other point I would make, even though we have less branches, our account growth is up. We are growing our account base in checking accounts in that 1.7%, 2% range. Our Now Banking growth is up in that 30% to 40% range. Credit card growth is over 10%, 11% range. So we are seeing strong growth in spite of the fact that we have less physical stores. Our revenue per branch is up also. Saul Martinez : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And if I could just follow up on loan growth. You are assuming in your 2017 guidance 2% to 2.5% real GDP growth. How do you think about the potential upside to that number? It may not in 2017 looking, but looking out late 2017, into 2018, if we do get a bit better economic growth environment, I assume it's not a linear relationship, risk appetite might move up, animal spirits and whatnot. But how do you think about the potential upside if the environment really does improve? Grayson Hall : Well, I mean it's hard to put a number around, right. But we are optimistic that as we look forward that there may be considerable upside to our forecast. What we are trying to do is to balance our emotions between what we know is going on today, what we know we can deliver and what we hope the future may hold for us. So there is awful lot of enthusiasm, a lot of people that are appearing to get more courage to invest, more courage to expand, but we still are trying to balance that in our markets. It's a great turn of emotions in our marketplace. We really are excited about what the potential upside might be. That being said, at the end of the day, from a forecast standpoint, we still have got to forecast what we know we can deliver. And so we are trying to balance that as I am sure you are. I am not use there is a solid answer to your question, but I do believe that there is a potential for considerable upside. David Turner : I think your point though, in terms of 2017, it's just probably, a lot of this has to manifest itself in 2017 for the effect to take in 2018 and 2019. So I think we have a lot to learn here over the coming months to see what the administration really does. Grayson Hall : We think as you think about our business, the commercial and middle market, small business customer represents about 25 percent, give or take, of the bank's profitability and that customer has not been borrowing for years. And so if we began to see a little extra pickup in the economy, particularly amongst the middle market customers, by small business customers, I think there is lot of upside for our company. Absolutely. Saul Martinez : That's good color. Thanks a lot. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Grayson Hall : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good afternoon guys. Thank you. David, can we go back to the capital question? You talked about with this year's CCAR that you are always going to want to keep the right amount of capital to run your business and I think in the past you may have used a 9% number. Is that still an appropriate number for the risks on the balance sheet? David Turner : Yes. It's a good question, Gerard. We use 9.5% common equity Tier 1 as kind of the range that we think we ought to have based on today's risk. We are obviously looking at different portfolios and we have de-risked a little bit. And as we do that, that number can go down. We also have added portfolios that have more risk to them that go the other way. But right now, we think 9.5% is probably a good target. Gerard Cassidy : Good. And then I think you also referenced in talking about this that you are looking at what other banks have done in terms of the ask in CCAR possibly going over 100% of earnings. With the proposed change for the under $250 billion in asset banks not having to go through the qualitative portion of the exam, does that give you more confidence to ask for a bigger number in view of what some of the banks did last year, but now with this change as well? David Turner : Well, certainly the removal of the qualitative aspect of this CCAR is incrementally helpful, but it's not a free pass. The regulatory supervisor will still engage very closely with our capital planning and governance processes. It just happens at a different time of the year. It will most likely happen in the third and fourth quarters as we prepare for an April delivery each year. Now this year is a transition year. So we will take some time, but not having the qualitative aspects and being able to leverage the models that we have built that have been reviewed over a number of years, it's where we get our confidence. We need to run our bank with the idea of what capital we think and our Board thinks we need to have. We know we are regulated and we have to evaluate that too, but the regulators aren't looking for us to try to out-guess them. They are trying to get us to run our bank appropriately and that's why we feel confident about being able to get our capital down to that 9.5% common equity Tier 1 over time in a prudent manner. And so we are going to march in that direction, the pace of which is going to be determined through further analysis, but that is really important for us to get to that 9.5% as we set our goal on return on tangible common of 12% to 14%. What's embedded in that is getting our capital optimized and rightsized. Grayson Hall : But the capital planning process has made constructive progress every year and we look at how the process has changed from last year to this year and we think it's been very constructive. It gives us more certainty. It give us more confidence. And I think that we have really developed a very rigorous, very disciplined capital planning process inside our company and we have got a lot of confidence that we can do the appropriate things given the risk on our balance sheet. So we continue to build confidence around our ability to manage capital. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up, you guys have done a very good job in closing down branches and in your answers today some good analysis of how you look at it. Have you taken into account for this the upcoming year in the branch closures that in a rising rate environment deposit behavior may be different? And what that affect your modeling on your payback? I think David you mentioned it's two years or less than two year. Have you factored that into the equation yet? David Turner : Well, a couple of things on that. We have and we try to anticipate deposit behavior. A couple of things that are happening. One, we have a loan deposit ratio of 81%. So we are in pretty good position there from a liquidity standpoint in a relationship bank has mattered and will matter going forward. We also recognize the TLAC from the larger players that cause them to have a different liquidity profile than they otherwise would have had and therefore perhaps a competition regarding deposits, especially in a one low single digit, 2% to 3% loan growth mode that put as much pressure on deposits and deposit rates. The growing, making investments that we want to, John talked about the retail network strategy of getting in some of the major metros and being able to be in places where we can grow deposits is really important to us in 2017 and beyond. Grayson Hall : But if you look at 2016 and even prior to that, our strategy has been to remix our deposit portfolio to make it more granular, to make it less interest rate sensitive and most of our growth has come in low-cost deposits and we have also reduced our dependency on higher cost deposits and also our dependency on deposits that require collateralization. When you look at where we are at today, we have ran some limited exercises to try to better understand how much we would have to move rates to attract new deposits into the company and we think we have a pretty good handle on how customers are reacting in higher markets in a higher rate environment and continue to be hopeful that our deposit betas will outperform. David Turner : Gerard, I will add one other thing. If you look at our supplement, on page 22 you will see our deposits broken out by consumer and corporate wealth management. You will see our wealth management, year-over-year, was down $2.2 billion and that's a decision we made that we weren't getting the kind of liquidity that we wanted. If we needed to, we could change our tune on that and we might have to pay up a little bit for deposits, but we have multiple avenues of funding and our liquidity position, in particular related to our securities portfolio and other assets that we can post up as collateral for the FHLB is very strong, which I think will bode well for us not having to chase these deposits. We will be unduly restrictive on our consolidation efforts. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you for the thorough answer. I appreciate it. A - Grayson Hall : All right. Thank you. That was our last question. We appreciate everyone's attendance today and we will stand adjourned. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions' first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Participating on the call are Grayson Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and David Turner, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also present and available to answer questions. A copy of the slide presentation referenced throughout this call, as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we will make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risk and uncertainties and we will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, as well as GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are detailed in our SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, Dana and good morning. Thank you for joining our call today. I will review highlights of our first quarter year-over-year financial performance and then David will take you through the details compared to the prior quarter. Let me begin by saying we are pleased with our first quarter results, which highlight our continued focus on effectively managing expenses and strengthening of our asset sensitive balance sheet. For the quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $278 million, an 8% increase over the first quarter of the prior year. Earnings per share were $0.23, representing a 15% increase over the prior year. Importantly, by expanding our customer base, we continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth as evidenced by growth in checking accounts, households, credit cards, and wealth management relationships. Taxable equivalent net interest income and other financing income was stable year-over-year, as interest rate increases offset the impact of lower average loan balances, and the resulting net interest margin was 3.25%, an increase of 6 basis points. Non-interest expenses remained well controlled, up less than 1% year-over-year as our efficiency efforts helped mitigate core expense inflation and the impact of investments in new initiatives. As it relates to loan growth, we are encouraged by conversations with our customers. Moreover, consumer and small-business sentiment continues to improve. In addition, customers particularly in the middle market segment are beginning to plan for future capital expenditures. However, this optimism is yet to translate into the conference needed to take on additional debt today. For now, customers appear to be in more of a wait and see mode. In the near-term, our asset sensitive balance sheet positions us to grow net interest income even in the absence of loan growth aided in part by the strength of our deposit franchise. We will continue to work closely with our clients to meet their financial needs, while also maintaining a disciplined focus on expense management and appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Year-over-year, average loans decreased $1.3 billion as growth in consumer lending portfolio was more than offset by declines in the business lending portfolio. The overall health of the consumer remained strong as we experienced solid demand and steady loan growth in almost all consumer loan categories. Average consumer loans grew by $719 million or 2% from the first quarter of the prior year. Average business lending balances declined $2.1 billion or 4% driven by continued focus on achieving appropriate risk adjusted returns, the de-risking of certain portfolios and asset classes, and an ongoing softness in demand for middle market commercial and small business loan. We are optimistic that loan growth will improve as the year progresses, but remain committed to prudently growing loans without compromising our risk or return requirements. With respect to asset quality, we continue to characterize overall credit quality is stable. Our energy portfolio is performing as expected, and there are no emerging concerns. However, given the current phase of the credit cycle, volatility and certain credit metrics can be expected, especially as it relates to large dollar commercial credits. Turning to capital deployment, we remain committed to managing capital towards our long-term targets. That includes effectively deploying our capital through organic growth and strategic investments to increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses, while also returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. Over the course of several years, we\u2019ve developed a robust capital planning process to ensure we have sufficient capital levels to withstand a variety of stress scenarios. We continue to focus on effective capital deployment and have submitted our CCAR plan in line with this initiative. We look forward to discussing the details of that plan with you next quarter. Our commitment to superior customer service also remains a top priority. And we are pleased that Regions was recently recognized as the highest rated bank in the US in customer experience by the Temkin Group. Moreover, Regions was the fourth highest rated company across all industries. Our teams remain focused on providing outstanding service as well as solid financial advice, guidance, and education to help our customers reach their financial goals. In summary, our first-quarter performance reflects a solid start to 2017, and we look forward to building on this foundation for the remainder of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David to cover the details of the first quarter. David? David Turner : Thank you Grayson and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a look at average loans. In the first quarter, average loan balances totaled $80.2 billion, down $411 million from the previous quarter. Average balances in the consumer lending portfolio decreased $215 million driven by the company's decision to exit a third-party arrangement within the indirect vehicle portfolio, as well as a sale of affordable housing residential mortgage loans at the end of 2016. Excluding these items, average consumer loans would have increased approximately $140 million in the first quarter.  Average third-party indirect-vehicle balances declined $186 billion or 9% during the quarter, and we expect this portfolio to decline between $500 million and $600 million on average during 2017. Excluding the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio, average indirect vehicle balances increased $33 million. Average mortgage balances decreased $16 million during the quarter. However, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter affordable housing residential mortgage loan sale of $171 million, average balances increased approximately 1%. We expect mortgage production to hold up relatively well despite the rising rate environment. This is due in part to Regions\u2019 mortgage production mix being more heavily weighted to purchase at approximately 70%. In addition, we recently enhanced our capabilities within our online home loan direct mortgage channel, and although it is a relatively small portion of total mortgage production today, we are encouraged by the recent results, which were up 41% year-over-year. Average home equity balances decreased $105 million as customers continue to pay off equity line of credit balances faster than new production. Average home equity lines of credit decreased $184 million, while average home equity loans increased $79 million, and we continued to experience success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $48 million or 5% linked quarter. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $20 million or 2%. Penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.6%, an improvement of 20 basis points compared to the prior quarter and 110 basis points year-over-year. Now turning to business lending, average balances decreased $196 million as declines in owner occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate were partially offset by growth in commercial and industrial loans. As Grayson mentioned, customer optimism has yet to translate into balance sheet growth. The linked quarter decline in average balances was primarily due to our continued focus on achieving appropriate balance and diversity, while also improving risk-adjusted returns. The company experience modest growth in average commercial industrial loans led by growth in government and institutional banking and increased utilization within real estate investment trust. However, we continue to reduce exposure due to concerns about increased risk in certain industries and asset classes. Average direct energy loans decreased $93 million or 4% during the quarter and ended the quarter at 2.5% of total loans outstanding. In addition, average multi-family loans decreased $147 million or 8%, compared to the fourth quarter. Further, softness in demand and competition from middle market and small business loans continues to impact loan productions. While headwinds to growth remain, we are experiencing success through improved overall returns, and the company continues to expect business lending growth in 2017, driven in part by growth in technology and defense, healthcare, power and utilities, and asset-based lending portfolios. Let's take a look at deposits. Total average deposits decreased $530 million from the previous quarter and average low-cost deposits decreased $173 million. Total average deposits in the consumer segment increased $605 million or 1% in the quarter. This growth reflects the unique strength of our retail franchise and overall health of the consumer. Average corporate segment deposits decreased $565 million or 2% during the quarter, impacted by seasonal declines. Average deposits in the wealth management segment declined $204 million or 2% during the quarter, as a result of ongoing strategic reductions of collateralized deposits. Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities, continue to shift out on deposits and into other fee income producing customer investments. Average deposits in the other segment decreased $366 million or 9%, driven by the strategic decision to reduce approximately $500 million of higher cost retail brokered sweep deposits that were no longer a necessary component of our current funding strategy.  Deposit costs remain at historically low levels at 14 basis points and total funding cost remained low totaling 32 basis points in the quarter. It is important to point out that our deposit base is more heavily weighted towards retail customers. Approximately 74% of average interest-bearing deposits and 52% of average interest-free deposits are considered retail. In addition, we have a loyal customer base as more than 40% of our consumer low-cost deposits have been deposit customers at regions for more than 10 years. And finally, approximately 50% of our deposits come from MSAs with less than 1 million people and approximately 35% from MSAs with less than 500,000 people, both are in the top quartile versus our peer group. For these reasons, we believe that our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value and will serve as a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. So let\u2019s see how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $881 million in the first quarter, an increase of $7 million or 1% from the fourth quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.25%, an increase of nine basis points. Both net interest margin, and net interest income and other financing income benefited from several factors during the quarter, including higher interest rates, and lower premium amortization on investment securities, partially offset by lower average loan balances, and modestly higher deposit cost. The modest increase in deposit cost is primarily attributable to index deposits, which make up approximately 6% of interest-bearing deposits. In addition, too fewer days in the quarter negatively impacted net interest income and other financing income by approximately $10 million, but benefited net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. Premium amortization on mortgage related securities declined to $38 million from $43 million during the quarter. If interest rates remain at current levels or rise further, we would expect to benefit from additional declines ultimately achieving a quarterly amortization run rate in the low-to-mid $30 million range in 2017. Looking forward to second quarter, we expect net interest margin to expand by an additional 3 basis points to 5 basis points in spite of the negative impact from one additional day. Non-interest income decreased $12 million or 2% in the quarter, primarily due to $5 million gain associated with the sale of affordable housing mortgage loans and $5 million gain from the sale of securities recorded in the prior quarter that did not repeat. Adjusted non-interest income decreased $2 million in the quarter. Wealth management income increased $6 million or 6%, primarily due to seasonal increases in both insurance and investment services income. Card and ATM fees increased $1 million or 1% due to an increase in interchange income. Checking account growth helped to offset seasonally weaker service charges, which declined $5 million or 3%. Mortgage income decreased $2 million or 5%, driven by lower production related to seasonality and rising interest rates. Consistent with our strategy to further increase the mortgage servicing portfolio, during the quarter the company reached an agreement to purchase the rights to service approximately $2.9 billion of mortgage loans with an expected close date of April 30. Including this transaction, the company will have purchased the rights to service more than $15 billion of mortgage loans over the past four years. Increased revenue from mortgage servicing is expected to help offset the impact of lower mortgage production. Capital markets income increased $1 million or 3% during the quarter as increased revenues associated with debt underwriting and loan syndications were partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory services. Looking forward, we expect capital markets revenue to improved throughout the remainder of the year and expect first quarters adjusted non-interest income to represent the low point for the year. Let\u2019s move on to expenses. Total non-interest expenses decreased 2% during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $872 million, $5 million less than the prior quarter, reflecting our continued commitment to disciplined expense management. Total salaries and benefits increased $6 million. Seasonal increases and payroll taxes were partially offset by declines in production-based incentives, while staffing levels remained relatively unchanged. Professional and legal expenses decreased $4 million during the quarter, primarily due to lower litigation related cost. Net occupancy expense decreased $4 million as the fourth quarter included elevated charges related to flood damaged branches, while the first quarter included insurance recoveries related to branch damages in prior periods. Other real estate expenses included within our other non-interest expense category also decreased $4 million during the quarter. Looking at second quarter, salaries and benefits are expected to increase as a result of merit and the issuance of long term incentive awards. In addition, increases in certain non-interest income categories will drive related increases in production-based incentives. However, our outlook for adjusted non-interest expenses for 2017 is unchanged as we continue to expect a year-over-year increase between 0% and 1%. The first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio improved 50 basis points to 62.7%, and the effective tax rate improved 80 basis points to 30.4%. Let\u2019s take look at asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $100 million in the first quarter, an increase of $17 million and represented 51 basis points of average loans. The current quarter included the impact of three large dollar commercial credit charge-offs totaling approximately $39 million. However, much of these large dollar commercial credits were already included in our reserve estimates. This combined with improvement in other credits meant that the provision for loan losses was $30 million less than net charge-offs and our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased 3 basis points to 1.33%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy portfolio decreased to 6.1% in the quarter, compared to 7% in the fourth quarter as our exposure to direct energy continued to decline, and the overall portfolio continues to stabilize. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale increased $9 million or 2 basis points to 1.26% of loans outstanding, driven by increases in non-energy commercial loans. Total business services criticized loans decreased 2% and total delinquencies decreased 16%. The improvement in criticized loans was primarily due to the declines in energy and energy-related credits. The decline in total delinquencies was driven by improvement in consumer loan categories. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans or [indiscernible] coverage ratio was 106% at quarter end. Excluding energy, the coverage ratio decreased from 138% to 135% in the first quarter. Total direct energy charge-offs, including the large commercial credit charge-off were $13 million this quarter. Given current market conditions, our expectation for additional energy related losses during the remainder of 2017 remains unchanged at $27 million or less. Regarding overall asset quality, we continue to view core credit metrics as stable. And although we experienced elevated charge offs during the quarter, associated with the larger dollar commercial credits, our expectations for full-year charge-offs of 35 basis points to 50 basis points remains unchanged. Let\u2019s move on to capital liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $150 million or 10.2 million shares of common stock and declared $78 million of dividends to common shareholders resulting in 80% of earnings returned to shareholders. At the same time, our capital ratios remain robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 12.1% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.3%. Now on a fully phased-in basis, the Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11.2%. And we were also fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio as of quarter-end. Finally, our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan and deposit ratio of 80%. So in terms of our expectations for the remainder of 2017, with respect to loan growth, several risk management decisions impacted our first quarter average balances, including declines in energy, multi-family, and third-party indirect vehicle portfolios, as well as a strategic affordable housing mortgage loan sale in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding these decisions, we would have reported average loan growth of approximately $200 million for the quarter. So looking ahead, we expect to modestly grow average loans on a sequential linked-quarter basis throughout the rest of 2017, and on an ending basis we expect to grow loans approximately 2% for the remainder of the year. Excluding the impact of our third-party indirect vehicle portfolio, we now expect full-year average loans to be approximately flat with the prior year. Regarding deposits, we now expect full-year average balances to be relatively stable with the prior year as continued consumer deposit growth is expected to offset the strategic reduction of certain collateralized and broker deposits. In spite of the revision to average loan growth, the improvement in market interest rates allows us to revise expectations for net interest income and other financing income growth upwards to 3% to 5%. Regarding non-interest income growth, due to a weaker start to 2017, we are revising downward our expectation for adjusted non-interest income growth to 1% to 3%. Total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2017 are still expected to increase between 0% and 1% and we remain committed to achieving a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 62% with positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. Additionally, we expect to continue to expect a full-year effective tax rate in the 30% to 32% range and expectations for full-year net charge-offs remain in the 35 basis point to 50 basis point range. So in summary, while there are several puts and takes this quarter, it is important to point out that our total revenue growth expenses efficiency and operating leverage expectations remain essentially unchanged despite lower balance sheet growth assumptions as we continue to focus on profitability and returns. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. [Operator Instructions] We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. Hi David, I was just wondering when you talk about your NIM expectations for the second quarter, can you talk a little bit about the betas that you are expecting underneath that and the impact from premium am that you\u2019d expect to kind of hope as that lags forward as well? David Turner : Sure. We believe that we are going to continue to have some benefit from premium amortization coming in a little lower. We were down about $5 million this quarter and expect that to continue to drift down until we get to that $30 million range where we think it stabilizes. As we think about NIM expectations and betas, we have baked in or beginning beta at about 40%, so there is a little upside opportunity. Our beta thus far has been less than 10% in both and vast majority of that was driven by the index deposits that we talked about, about 6% of interest-bearing deposit. So, if our beta comes in, a little better than we forecast, maybe we can outperform, we do have kind of baked in, so the remainder of the year about hike and half baked in for this year with that 40% beta in our guidance that we have just given you. So, if we get rate increases quicker, if we get a steepening in the yield curve, those would benefit us above the guidance that we have given you. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up to that, so given that you have been in part purposely reducing some of the auto loans and you still haven't seen this year re-loan run-off, how much of keeping a low beta is just the fact that loan growth is somewhat purposely quiet for you guys, and so just in terms of that push and pull between behavioral out there versus your need for excess deposits given that the balance sheets remain pretty stable? David Turner : We've had historically one of the lowest loan deposit ratios and it really speaks to our ability to attract low-cost deposit, our retail franchise, and the stickiness of our deposit base. What we have done is, we clearly want all the good low-cost deposits we can get. We would like to have a more robust demand for loan growth, but we're not going to force it, we\u2019re going to take what the market is going to give us, and we have made some strategic choices in terms of where we want to grow loans and we have looked at different categories that I have mentioned and Grayson has mentioned to be very careful. So, we clearly have the funding to the extent that the economy fixes up in the second half of the year, which we hope and expect, but we have good core funding that can take advantage of those opportunities, and we think we will keep our deposit beta down partly because of loan deposit ratio, partly because of our [indiscernible] deposit make up in the less sensitivity of our deposit franchise to price increases, which is why we think we can have expanding margin continuing. Grayson Hall : Well we\u2019ve had very stable loan deposits even though behind the scenes we\u2019ve really been changing the composition of our deposit base quite materially. Every quarter, the composition of our deposit base has gotten more favorable. And to David's point, we\u2019ve made a lot of tactical and several strategic decisions about how we build that composition of deposits, and so I think it puts us in a very unique position as we go forward. To David's point, we don't have the loan demand we would love to have today that does take an awful lot of pressure off of deposit pricing, so we could be more thoughtful and disciplined in that regard, but really the composition of our deposit base is probably the most compelling argument for how we will perform. Ken Usdin : Understood, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : Hi, good morning. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Peter Winter : I was just wondering on the fee income, if I look at fee income, last year it was very strong and I\u2019m just wondering, can you talk about some of the puts and takes of the weaker guidance this year? David Turner : Yes, thanks Peter. So from an NIR standpoint, we have made a lot of investments over the years. Last year, a lot of those were coming to fruition from the investments we made the year before, so the growth rate was necessarily going to be higher last year and even our guidance in the beginning of the year was lower because of that phenomenon. Clearly, some of the businesses that we\u2019ve gotten into have more volatility than other streams and we are okay with that because we are seeking the diversification, that\u2019s important to us and we are also seeking to have those products and services that fulfill the need of a customer. In this particular quarter, our capital markets showed a little bit of volatility to the downside, in particular on our M&A advisory service, which we believe will grow from here, it just takes time, the pipeline to get emptied out. It takes time to rebuild those. So, we feel comfortable with that. I would say in the fixed income space, March was a much better month than January and February was. There was more activity there and so we expect that to continue to grow. We are really proud of our folks in mortgage, obviously the first quarter is seasonally low, but done a great job because of being a purchase shop there, and a strength of roughly $8 billion of mortgage servicing we bought last year coming through. They just do a great job in low-cost servicing and we're proud of that growth. So that checking account growth and customer growth have really helped us to bolster NIR. So, we did revise guidance down, but feel very good about where we are and we think it will pick up. We guided that this was the low watermark for the year. Peter Winter : Okay, and just a quick follow-up. On the 10-year treasury, in the expectation page, you are showing the 10-year treasury at 2.48, 10-year treasury right now is lower, if it continues to move lower, would that put pressure on the net interest income to come in more towards the lower end of your range? David Turner : Clearly, if you stayed here or kept going lower, you would ultimately have some pressure in terms of prepayments coming in and premium amortization not declining at the pace that I\u2019ve mentioned. We think we are well-positioned, we have about 40% of our sensitivity on the backhand. We believe we are well positioned in particular as the Fed's balance sheet comes under scrutiny towards the end of the year, and we just think there is going to be ultimately upward pressure, but we still think our guidance is, we had enough confidence to give an increase in the guidance that we just shared with you. Peter Winter : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Grayson Hall : Good morning Marty. Marty Mosby : Good morning. Got more of a long-term strategic kind of question, on Slide 10 you look about your capital liquidity kind of ratios, you are more than fully compliant with any regulatory requirement that you have, capital ratios continue to ebb up, and your loan to deposit ratio continues to go down, is there a chance in the future strategically to address these accesses that are on your balance sheet that need to be deployed to get your returns higher? David Turner : Marty, this is a great question. I will start with capital and come back to liquidity. From a capital standpoint, we clearly have given the Street, our guidance that we believe our common equity Tier 1 ratio target of 9.5% is right for us based on the risk in our balance sheet today. We know to get it to 9.5%, you have to get it deployed appropriately. We seek to do that through organic loan growth properly priced with the proper returns on it. We then deploy that capital into bolt-on acquisitions and you have seen a number of acquisitions over the years, including the mortgage servicing right deal that we did last year, a series of deals and the one we are going to close at the end of this month. And we also want to have an appropriate dividend to pay to our shareholders. And then outside of that to the extent we continue to [indiscernible] capital we are going to work our capital ratios down returning it to our shareholders. Last year we returned to 105% of our earnings to our shareholders. We can't tell you what our CCAR request is this year, but given what I just said, one would expect a fairly robust return to our shareholders this year and that over time is important to us to get towards to that 9.5% because we still are expecting to have a return on tangible common in 2018 between 12% and 14%. In order to do that, we have to get the denominator down to that approaching 9.5%. So that\u2019s capital. From a loan and deposit standpoint, we would like to have a loan deposit ratio perhaps in that low [indiscernible] range will be a sweet spot. And we're working hard to grow loans, but we are going to force it as I mentioned earlier. We are going to grow loans, when we have the opportunity to do that and calling efforts are ongoing and also on the deposit side we\u2019ve looked at certain deposits that either were punitive and LCR or they weren\u2019t providing liquidity such as collateralized deposit where we might not have had a full relationship and we are letting those deposits go. So that\u2019s why if you just look at the deposit growth you would see it declining in part. Those are strategic choices that we are making to [indiscernible] those deposits that really don't benefit provide much benefit to us. Marty Mosby : My worry is that in what we are seeing is growing market mortgage servicing which is low return business, when you are just looking at allocating to it, capital, when you have capital there and you put it on it generates better returns because you are just utilizing excess capital, you are also, over the last two credit cycles, the large dollar corporate is what kind of jumped out and we're seeing that again this quarter and when you think about organically in your markets given the appropriate pricing and credit underwriting you have there is a real catch between being able to organically build or fill these buckets and really being able to eventually get a lot of this trapped capital and then utilize some of those liquidity and pushing that back to the shareholders. So, I know it is a struggle, but some of these decisions that are being forced upon you because of the situation you are in are causing some of these events or things or decisions to be made that may be affecting things differently down the road. David Turner : Well they are Marty, again, we know it is harder today in a competitive environment to grow the kind of loans that we want to grow, but this is when it requires discipline and we're going to say disciplined regards to capital allocation to organic growth. And as I mentioned, some of the choices we have made outside of those, we actually are growing. So we are seeing opportunities to put the capital to work and frankly, we don't have the qualitative aspects of CCAR and we don't have much capital we need to have to run our business, so we do have an avenue to deal with that access common equity more specifically in returning it to shareholders that we didn't have before. So, in time we can get the capital base to the right level. Grayson Hall : Marty, this is Grayson. I mean to David's point, we have got to take the market for what it is and take advantage where opportunities present themselves, but the operating environment has got some challenges, this has also got tremendous upside if some things go the way we owe. That being said, we\u2019ve been very rigorous and very disciplined about how we are managing our balance sheet. We think we have made tremendous progress on both loans and deposits in terms of how we have built our balance sheet over the last several quarters. We are trying to take advantage of what the market will give us, but not to force it, and we do think that in this sort of slow growth low rate environment that we have to be thoughtful about it. That being said, we are seeing a lot of optimism on the part of our business customers, it\u2019s encouraging, but it has not yet resulted in the kind of demand for bank credit that we would like to see. That being said, tremendous amount of liquidity in the market and we have seen a lot of our customers access public debt markets, and so we do think over time that bank credit demand become stronger. I will ask John Turner to speak to that for just a moment to give you a better perspective of what we are seeing in customers and markets. John Turner : Thanks Grayson. As we talked about before, our customers are clearly more optimistic, I would say not confident, they are cautious. We are seeing a little improvement in our pipeline, I would say our pipelines are growing a bit. They are okay relative to where we would like them to be. When we look back on and we talk about choices we\u2019ve made and the impact that that has had on us, our objective is to create a more predictable, more sustainable, more consistent revenue base and performance, and we\u2019ve been very focused on de-risking on risk-adjusted returns. So if I look at our lost business or the opportunities that we had to grow, in 2016 we looked at over $44 billion in credit, we've won about $14 billion or roughly a third that means that of the $28 billion that we didn't win over half of that was because we were not satisfied with the pricing or some other structural element. That same momentum or same sort of paradigm has continued into 2017. We have looked at over $10 billion in credit through the first quarter, we have won a little over a third and as a business we didn't win again about 55% of that was a result of pricing or returns or some other structural element. Point being, we could change our risk appetite and grow loans, but we are very committed to creating a culture that is focused on risk adjustment returns and that we will create more predictability, more consistency, and I think that\u2019s going to pay off in the long run. Grayson Hall : Thank you, John. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Those are tough decisions and I know you are working through them. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. Just curious about, I know you guys have a small commercial real estate portfolio and retail and shopping centers, I just wonder if you could give us some details around that composition as it stands as of now? Grayson Hall : I will ask Barbara Godin our Chief Credit Officer to respond to that question please. Barbara Godin : Good morning, Jennifer. Thank you, Grayson. Yes, we currently have roughly $2.6 billion in our commercial real estate retail. Another comment though, just general comment on the retail sector is what we're seeing is in retail where they have very good shopping centers, very well placed, there is hardly any vacancy rate and then in others there is just a kind of vacancy rates where you are not appropriately placed, but we're working that sector very closely, we still feel okay about that sector, the bankruptcies that we have heard about and the issues we have heard about in that area. We have an applied market research group that actually spends a ton of their time looking at retail and retail shopping centers. Those bankruptcies were not unexpected. In general, we weren't involved in any of those. And again, a lot of those chains that closed were because they were poorly placed. John Turner : Grayson I just might add to that. Jennifer this is John Turner. Of the 2.6 billion exposure, roughly $1.5 billion in outstandings I should say, is in our REIT portfolio where we largely are doing business with a small number of investment grade names. The balance or just about $1 billion is in our income property finance group and that outstanding level has been fairly consistent now for four five quarters. That exposure is fairly widely distributed. The largest, I guess tenant would be grocery anchored and most of it is basic needs kind of anchors. And so while we have a little mall exposure in the REIT book and less in income property finance, let\u2019s say generally it is a very diversified portfolio and one we feel pretty good about. On the commercial side, and we also have a nice size retail book that portfolio again is very diverse, our largest asset class is to automotive retailers. So think of companies like [indiscernible] something like that, and largely administered through our asset based lending or Regions business capital platform. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Jennifer Demba : Or would you see this area has something you would want to reduce over time or just kind of watching it for a while here? Barbara Godin : We are watching it again. We have concentration limits on everything. It is nowhere near its concentration limit on these two pieces, so we feel fine of that. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hi good afternoon guys. I wanted to follow-up on a question that Marty had asked just regarding delivering the 12% to 14% RTCE, David you talked about you need to get towards the 9.5% CET1, do you think you could, given what\u2019s happening with the balance sheet, do you think you can get there organically with loan growth and capital return or do you think we would need to see some strategic activity over the next two years in order to manage their capital base down? David Turner : Ryan, it\u2019s a great question. So, we can approach that 9.5%. We can't quite get to 9.5% by 2018, right after that, shortly after that we can, but we will approach it close enough to help us get to that 12% to 14% return and we will do that through primarily focusing on those two things. Organic growth and some bolt-on acquisitions that have been fairly small today. And capital returns to the shareholders. Ryan Nash : Got it. Grayson if I can ask a bigger picture question, you know the bank has done a lot over the last few years to improve its credibility with the investor community, you guys did a great job delivering last year, when I look at today we are obviously making some changes to the outlook, while NII is better, that\u2019s obviously rate driven, so it\u2019s not necessarily client driven and I take the point that you guys are doing this with the mind on return, so if loans are shrinking fees are coming in lower, was there any thought towards taking another crack at expenses, I know you are cutting 400 million or at least saying given the slightly weaker top line outlook, we are going to hold expenses flat or maybe even flat to up modestly down? Grayson Hall : I mean, great question. And I would tell you that as we look at the first quarter, first quarter loan demand was softer and we had anticipated it would be couple of quarters ago and so we\u2019ve had to adjust our thinking to a little bit slower loan growth environment. We\u2019ve never really tempered our focus on expense management. We\u2019ve stayed dedicated to that throughout this process and continue to do so. We took a very aggressive stands on expenses and have delivered on that. You should expect to continue to see our results on that issue. From a sustainability standpoint, we do have to find where we used to grow long term, but until those opportunities come about then we have to continue to stay focused on being as efficient as possible from an expense standpoint and so you should not see us back down from that at all. Ryan Nash : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Marsh of FBR. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Steve Marsh : Good morning. Following up on expenses, I was just wondering here, you had another good quarter with regard to total expenses, does your guidance here not go into the low-end reflect continued investment or other factors in terms of expectations around improved business activity later on the year? Grayson Hall : I mean we will focus on interest expenses. We do at this point in time anticipate stronger growth opportunities in the second half of the year then we had seen in the first quarter and so, that\u2019s just a prudent position we have taken and I think that if that group growth doesn't, occur then obviously we have other decisions to make. David you want to add to that? David Turner : Yes, I think that we have built into our kind of inflation run rate on expenses in the 2.5% range and so if you take that, if you take the investments we will want to make, need to make and have made relative to diversifying our revenue stream we have to overcome that by having other expense eliminations elsewhere. And so we put our $400 million program together and I think we have done a really good job in there. Our efficiency ratio target is intact of 62% this year, and 18 we will be in that 60% range, and so I don't think that when you deliver to 2% GDP type environment that you can take your eye off the expense ball whatsoever. And we didn't change, kind of went through all the changes and guidance, you also know the things that didn't change, which was our commitment to generating parts of operating leverage in that 2% to 4%. So, everything is in check, but we can always continue to work even harder on expense management and we will, each and every day we work hard on. Steve Marsh : Okay. And then my second question with regard to the three large credit stake, you experienced charge-offs and what industries where they in? Barbara Godin : Yes, this is Barbara again. One of them was in healthcare, one was in oilfield services in the energy sector and the third was an educational services, but you will see it show up in our commercial real estate owner occupied because it was secured by the real estate and those three made up to $39 million. Steve Marsh : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Grayson Hall : Good morning John. John Pancari : Good morning. Also on the credit front regarding the trends, I know you indicated the inflows into MPLs in the quarter they were also commercial related, are they similar sectors or are they related to those charge-offs you just flagged, the healthcare and educational services and OFS? Barbara Godin : They are. John Pancari : Okay. Barbara Godin : And again having said that, I would just stay on credit in general though I would want to reemphasize we are very comfortable where we are in our credit numbers, our credit metrics, where credit is going, even those three large credit charge-offs that we had, generally not unexpected, generally they were provided for, it was simply a matter of timing as the resolve themselves in the first quarter and we want to hit and charge them on. John Pancari : Okay, so despite the fact that MPLs were flat, I mean I hear you that you feel good about it, but I guess what I\u2019m worried about is that, I know you didn't change your charge of guidance of 30 bips to 50 bips despite coming into that 50 because of those items this quarter, is the risk to that 30 bips to 50 bips is going higher? Barbara Godin : No, I don't feel that there is a risk there. Again, I feel fine about it. I think about our non-performing loan portfolio. In total, including our small credits all the way up to our large ones in the business services book. We have 73% of them are paying current and as agreed and 98% of those that are in our CNI and CRE owner occupied area are also paying current and as agreed. So, again I hate to position it as a good quality non-performing book, but we do see a lot of upside opportunities that those can and will return to accruing basis at some point. John Pancari : Okay, thanks Barb and then separately, on the expense side, I heard what you said about the not re-uping your expense program or anything, but in light of everything going on, what would you call your normalized efficiency ratio once we get a little bit more about way of higher rates and maybe a bit of improvement in loan growth? David Turner : Yes, it is a great question John. So, what we have said is that we would get to that 60% range in 2018. I do think over time if you can get normalized rates whatever that might mean to everybody that were you having a margin in that 350 range that perhaps you can be in that mid upper 50s over time, I think our industry is going to have to become more efficient, I think we will, I think we will leverage technology better in the future than we do today, but it is going to take some time to get there and so you should see us continue to march down. Let\u2019s get to 60 and then we will give you better guidance as to where that might end up post that. John Pancari : And David one more thing, sorry, with that 60%, how much by the way of hikes does that require? David Turner : We have baked in 1.5 this year and the 2 the year after that through 2018. That\u2019s what our number is. John Pancari : And therefore getting to that 60% by the end of 2018? David Turner : Say that again John. John Pancari : And therefore getting to that 60% level by the end of 2018? David Turner : That's right. John Pancari : All right. Got it. Thanks David. David Turner : Really for the year of 2018, John. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi thanks for taking my questions. Couple more on capital, just to follow-up, first is more of a clarification and sorry if I missed this in response to an earlier question, but David I think you mentioned that you can get to 9.5% CET1 by 2018 or close to it organically, is that correct, is that by year-end 2018, is that for 2018 CCAR cycle, just want to make sure I understood the specific guidance you gave there? David Turner : So, we said we could approach 9.5% by the end of 2018 through organic growth and capital return to shareholders and some bolt-on acquisitions, not large ones, but some bolt-on non-bank type acquisitions during that same period of time. Saul Martinez : Okay got it. And then just following up on your acquisition strategy, your thought process I should say on acquisitions and M&A, can you just give us a little bit more color, I think obviously up until now it has been bolt-on acquisitions, it\u2019s been focused on fee-based businesses, but could that or under what conditions would that change and would you start to think about perhaps more sizable deals and doing bank M&A? David Turner : Right now we have been for the last several quarters, primarily focused on organic growth and augmenting that with a limited number of, what we would call bolt-on acquisitions. Those acquisitions have largely been in the capital markets group, also and well planned, in particular insurance, and also in our mortgage business. You should expect us to continue to look for those opportunities to make investments, these are not large investments, but they are investments that are accretive to our earnings, and we think they have been good in terms of expanding our product line, leveraging our strengths to serve our customers. And so you just continue to see that occurred. And when it comes to bank acquisitions, we still actively look at opportunities and review those. Quite frankly the economics around those today are particularly challenging given where regional bank stocks trade in relationship to the smaller institutions and sellers if you would. The economics that the market is giving us, they are not particularly compelling, so we have not spent an awful lot of time looking it there. I think at any acquisition we do, it has to be both strategic and economic, and at this point in time we have not seen that as a particularly productive thing for us to be heavily focused on. That being said, we make sure that we are mindful on what\u2019s going on in the market. Right now, our focus is on organic growth and on limited bolt-on acquisitions. Saul Martinez : Okay, is it fair to say that if relative valuations between smaller banks or potential acquires and larger banks were to narrow that on the margin that would make you a bit more have to consider bank M&A? David Turner : If the relative multiples were to come closer together than the attractiveness of that as an acquisition strategy improves. [Indiscernible]. Saul Martinez : Alright, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. Grayson Hall : Hi John. John McDonald : Hi good morning. Just following up on two other questions, on credit Barb with the reserves ex energy at around 135, do you think there is more room for reserve release this year or do you - you probably going to more match the charge-offs going forward? Barbara Godin : Well we're back to our [indiscernible] of, we don't predict what the results are going to be, what we do is we have a very disciplined process, 135 is on the higher end, so there could be some room for improvement, but I wouldn\u2019t want to enter a guess as to what that might be. John McDonald : Okay. David regarding the branch reductions what are your thoughts on longer term potential for more branch consolidations post the 150 expected by the end of this year? David Turner : So, we have got more - limited more branches post crisis than any other bank. We continue to do that like any retail franchise you should expect to have some consolidations and some new investments as we have new branch designs that are going in. We haven't had a lot of new branches go in off late, but we need to bolster our retail network presence in some places and so you should expect us to do both, consolidate, as well as to add, you know, after we get finished with this series we will come back with better guidance, but we don't see any large branch consolidations at this particular time, but continue to challenge ourselves in terms of what the retail network franchise needs to look like. John McDonald : Okay that's helpful. And then and one just quick follow-up on the net interest margin, near-term David, how relying is the near-term expectation of that 3 basis point to 5 basis point increase for the second quarter, on the 10-year being at a certain level whether it is the 248 or whatever you are assuming? David Turner : It\u2019s not all that meaningful in the near term, I think we can, we have given you, we feel pretty confident in that range, clear for the next quarter. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Michael Rose : My questions were actually just asked. So thanks guys, appreciate it. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Grayson Hall : Hi, Matt. Matt Burnell : Good morning, Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. David, good afternoon to you. Just couple of days quickies, one, on the mortgage side of things that held up pretty well year-over-year and I think that has a lot to do with the purchase focus. as well as some of your MSR acquisitions, but a couple of your competitors have suggested that they are reducing the acceptable level of the spreads of new production to hopefully drive some better purchase volume, and I\u2019m curious if that is anything that you all have considered, I presume giving your earlier comment, the answer is no, but I am just wondering if you are seeing any evidence of that and if you are doing it yourself? David Turner : No, we haven't done anything really to go out there and try to spur growth using rates, being historically a purchase shop using our own mortgage loan originators versus third parties had been one of the reasons why we have outperformed historically. If you look at our change in yields on raising mortgage, we were down 1 basis point over the quarter, so we think we can have an appropriate growth. This first quarter production was nice. Clearly gets challenged as rates go up, I think being a purchase shop is really beneficial to us. Grayson Hall : First quarter is seasonally a soft quarter for us on mortgage originations, but the team did a very good job and rarely outperformed same quarter last year and so we\u2019ve got fairly strong confidence going into the second quarter on production. About a third of our mortgage originations come from referrals out of our own branches and so to David's point the mortgage originators were all on our team and they are working closely with our branch offices, the strong referral process across the two. We had about 70% purchased 30% refinance in the first quarter. We see those numbers shifting even stronger and the early days of the second quarter, so we think repurchase is going to be very strong in the second quarter. Matt Burnell : And then David if I could follow-up with a question in the realm of no good deed goes unpunished, we\u2019ve now had three rate hikes and I guess I\u2019m just curious, when do you think you start thinking about potentially reducing your rate sensitivity, just in terms of trying, just to reduce the concern about rates going back down? David Turner : Yes, that is a constant challenge for us. We think that when the market gives as our kind of returns that we want to have in our business that we would take that sensitivity down. We are not there today. We need to be and continue to be asset sensitive is important to us. So we went up 100s and still in that $150 million range. So we have done some things to protect us on a down rate perspective. We had taken some of the sensitivity off a few quarters ago, by booking some - receive fixed swaps. I think we are in pretty good shape today to let our sensitivity run. In part, it is really the benefit we get from our deposit base. That is so critical to us to keep that in mind as we think about our ability to continue to grow NII and resulting margin is that core sticky customer deposit base is not as price sensitive as others. And I think right now given what we think rate increases were going, there will come a point in time we have to start paying up for deposits. We get delivered, the kind of spread and margin we want and gets our return to where we need to be, and we can take our sensitivity to more of a neutral state at that time. Matt Burnell : Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good afternoon Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi guys. I just want to follow-up on the fee revenue side, the last couple of years you have been investing in a number of the businesses, couple acquisitions, modest, but a couple of deals, you know it feels like the outlook for the fees is somewhat tempered, somewhat modest and I know there are still some drag in the service charges, but I guess it was kind of like all in, how are you measuring the investments and the performance of those investments and I guess the real question is, do you want to keep trying to build out the fee businesses when maybe you haven't gotten as much momentum from what you have done so for. David Turner : Matt it is a great question. I do think that\u2019s a challenge for us. Any time we make an acquisition and purchase something to understand what that alternative return is, I will tell you we are ahead of the game on most of our acquisitions that we have had over time. And I think that we do realize there is some volatility. So in the given quarter you can\u2019t look at one of these transactions and give up on it. We continue to challenge ourselves, we know some of these aren\u2019t as efficient and some of the businesses that we have, but they are synergistic. They offer a service or product to our customers and our customers need and will pay for.  So you have to look at the whole relationship profitability and not just cherry pick one product at a time. That being said, we have expectations on capital returns for our businesses and if those businesses can't get the returns that we need to have, the product or the business is not synergistic to our customer base, then we will make different decisions, but right now we feel very good about what we\u2019ve added over time and frankly we are looking for other opportunities to continue to grow. Matt O'Connor: And you did mention the mortgage servicing acquisition, but cross the other fees categories, investments, capital markets, insurance any preference there or does depend on what\u2019s available and how might it fit with you guys? David Turner : Well the reason we are doing, the mortgage servicing rights acquisition are for couple of reasons. The primary one is, we're very good at it. We have a group folks that work in South Mississippi that are very talented. They have been doing this for a long time. We didn't get into trouble like others did during the crisis because of their expertise. We also have capacity. We could add about right at $10 billion of servicing in round numbers without changing our fixed cost infrastructure. And so we want to take advantage of that and continue to grow that portfolio. So being a low cost servicer I think is beneficial to us, and one area that we do have the opportunity to grow and get deals presented to us, periodically, some we turn down and some we take. So, I wouldn't put any particular category that we would want to grow in NII, if I had to point one card in ATM fees, card fees in particular through interchange, our credit card growth has been very nice, up about 10% last year. And that is a good product, one of our best products in terms of return because it gives us interchange, it gives us carry, it gives us a hook into our customers, very synergistic with our business model. And so we would like to have more cards and so getting our penetration rate up from 18.6%, that\u2019s the penetration into our deposit base. Hitting that up in the mid-20% range is really important to us and teams got that focus and I expect to get there in time. Grayson Hall : Well I just remind everyone we have been very aggressive on branch rationalization, branch consolidation and at the same time we have been able to accomplish that and still grow accounts, grow households, deliver and get recognized for very good customers, and all of that fosters some real good fundamental execution, own our plans and at the end of the day most of the growth on our balance sheet and on our income statement is going to come from really increasing in number of customers that we have banking with us and making sure we are meeting as many of their needs that they value is possible. And so we\u2019ve really done a good job even in the face of brand consolidation we have done a good job of growing our business across all of our consumer account segments. Matt O'Connor: Okay thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Grayson Hall : Good afternoon rather. Kevin Barker : Good afternoon. You mentioned that you anticipate stronger growth in the back half of this year, is that primarily due to the small business optimism that you are hearing right now, given the outlook for lower regulation and changes from the administration or is it primarily just because of other factors that are developing or a stronger pipeline? Grayson Hall : I mean, I think one, when we looked at the second half of the year, we are encouraged by the optimism, but we are not trying to factor that and too much into our forecast and our plans, but when we look at how the first quarter has performed economically across communities we operate in, we think first quarter was somewhat soft and so we do think and believe that the economic metrics we are following and the sentiment of our customers all sort of point to a stronger second half of the year.  Now we are not fully counting all of that. We are trying to make sure that we are taking a very disciplined and thoughtful approach to it, but all of our metrics indications would tend to favor more upside in the second half. Kevin Barker : Okay and then just to follow up on some of the comments around capital return, obviously CCAR and stress test are changing significantly this time around, do you expect that you peer group to be a lot more aggressive this year in returning capital or do you think it could be relative muted given last year? David Turner : Your guess is as good as mine. I can\u2019t really comment on what others are going to do. I see what others have written about our peers, but I can tell you from our standpoint what is incumbent upon all of us to ensure we have an appropriate amount of cap for the risk that we have and I think most people have more common equity than they need at this point. The question is how do each of us plan to deploy, we have our plan as we just discuss. So, I think for us it is a robust, should be a robust return and we will discuss that at our next call. Grayson Hall : Surely not appropriate for us to comment on what others might or might not do. Kevin Barker : Okay, thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon Grayson. Maybe you guys can share with us, earlier you had talked about the underwriting and the loan opportunities that you guys see in the small business area and you are missing out on some of the opportunities due to pricing and then the structure of the loans, so can you guys share with us what are some of the structures that you are seeing that really you are not comfortable with whether it is on a real estate loan to value or possible debt service and how do those underwritings tend to compare to maybe a year or ago? John Turner : Gerard this is John Turner. I would just maybe Barb can help me too, but I would say we are seeing more competitive pricing, we are seeing longer tender, we are seeing higher loan to values with respect to real estate, particularly the owner occupied real estate sector. We are seeing appetite for more leverage than we might be willing to accept. Less guarantee, sometimes no guarantee, where we think a guarantee is appropriate, all those would be factors that are impacting a loan growth in our view. I don\u2019t know that it has changed a lot, although I would say since 2015. So over the last five quarters we think there has been less activity and so more competition for the opportunities we see and I would guess that it has - competition has impacted the marketplace for sure. Barbara Godin : Gerard the only other one I would throw in, a lot of pressure around coming in late structures throughout in the market right now. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, is it coming from smaller community banks or other regional banks or of some of the big for bank, the universal banks? Barbara Godin : Yes. Gerard Cassidy : The competition that is? Everyone. John Turner : I mean I think it depends on the opportunity and the market, the customer, and how that customer proceeds in a marketplace, it varies, but I would say a competition is competition and we see it from time to time from everybody and somebody would probably say the same thing about us at some level. We certainly want to protect relationships that we have, finding it more difficult to win new business in our existing markets. Gerard Cassidy : Great and then just to pivot a bit, obviously you guys have done a very good job in reducing the branch count, can you give us some color, I don't know if you have any statistics at your fingertips about the mobile usage, how many of your customers use the mobile channel, what percentage of your deposits might be coming through the mobile channel and things like that? Grayson Hall : I will ask John Owen, Head of General Banking to respond to that question. John Owen : When we look at the digital space we could see pretty rapid growth on our mobile usage, we have got about 2.3 million digital users today. That number has been growing double digits over the last couple of years. We'll see that continue. From a deposit standpoint, about 30% of our deposits go through digital channels. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : Thanks for taking my question. Barb can you delve into the CNI trends in terms of credit quality, just saw small changes on the non-accruals as well as the performing TDRs and just wanted to compare that on the non-energy side, I thought that the criticize on energy were up slightly, just curious if there is a trend there or anything you can delve into? Barbara Godin : Really is in a trend again as I look at what has gone into our issues about non-accrual, this quarter we had credit in transportation warehousing, we had a couple in energy, we had a couple in healthcare, we had one in AG, so no real trends that we are seeing and when I look at each one and read the stories on each one, again there is nothing that\u2019s underlying that connects any of them, they were individual circumstances, you know, when one takes, when somebody died we're waiting for the stage to settle as an example. Those kinds are same. So across the board in general for all of the other sectors doing pretty well, remember we thought energy, but what we don't give a lot of detail of it because it is spread everywhere else is those industries that also support energy. So, one of the transportation of warehousing credits I'm looking at that when in this quarter is to support the energy sector as an example. And I can point to a couple of others that have tangential relationships to the energy sector as well. But broad-based again feel good about where our credit numbers are, feel good that we will add up between that 35 to 50 basis points this year. And on the one credit charge of that we take there was one this quarter that was a larger one, but actually the charge of happened on a Saturday, it was April 1, the quarter that ended and we knew the right thing that the right thing to do was to take this quarter instead of moving it into the second quarter and that was a $22 million charge. Again causing us to show more elevated charge-offs and perhaps the other ways [indiscernible] to the quarter, but again it was the right thing to do. Christopher Marinac : Okay, got it. Thank you for the color and just a quick follow-up, if we take the remaining energy losses out of those sort of guidance range will it be closer to the 35 and if we just excluded energy on a calculation? Barbara Godin : If you excluded the energy it would be again somewhere between, I'm still going to see 35 to 45 port probably recognizing that our business mix has changed, you know as we recall we talk about some businesses we are doing in our cost consumer book that we weren't doing previously. They were all great businesses they are doing well. If you look at what they are providing us from a revenue perspective they are hitting on their mark, but again they are going to provide some higher losses that are going to come into that 35 to 50 basis point range, but they otherwise didn't in prior periods. Christopher Marinac : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Hall for closing remarks. Grayson Hall : Well thank you for your participation. We appreciate the opportunity to tell the Regions story and we will stand adjourned. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation\u2019s Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer will review highlights of our second quarter year-over-year financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the details compared to the prior quarter. Other members of the management are also present and available to answer questions. A copy of the slide presentation referenced throughout this call, as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we will make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risk and uncertainties and we\u2019ll also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, as well as GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are detailed in our SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that, we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results, which demonstrate that we are continuing to execute our strategic plan with a long-term sustainable growth, while delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders. For the quarter, earnings available to common shareholders from continuing operations increased 18% to $301 million, and earnings per share increased 25% to $0.25 compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly by expanding our customer base, we delivered results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income generation. This is evidenced by growth in checking accounts, households, credit cards, and wealth manager relationships, as well as total assets under management. We continue to benefit from our asset sensitive balance sheet, as interest rate increases drove a 4% increase and net interest income year-over-year, and the resulting net interest margin increased 17 basis points. Expenses remain well controlled with adjusted non-interest expenses increasing 1% year-over-year, as our efficiency efforts continue to mitigate core expense inflation and the impact of investments in new initiatives. As it relates to our loan portfolio, we remain focused on our deliberate and intentional diversification strategy, while we also seek to achieve appropriate risk adjusted returns. We are experiencing success with our remixing efforts. For example, we were early movers to reduce exposure in certain asset classes, including auto and multifamily lending. While our customers remain optimistic, many still do not have the confidence necessary to make meaningful investments and take on additional debt. That said, we are seeing some positive signs. For example, we experienced solid loan production increases across most loan portfolios during the second quarter, and we fully expect this momentum to continue through the second-half of the year. In the near-term, our interest rate sensitivity profile continues to position us well to grow net interest income even in the absence of meaningful loan growth aided in part by the strength of our deposit franchise. With respect to asset quality, our discipline approach to credit continues to deliver positive results, as we reported improvements in almost every credit metric. We continue to characterize overall credit quality stable. However, volatility from quarter-to-quarter and certain credit metrics can be expected, especially as it relates to large dollar commercial credits. Turning to capital deployment, we remain committed to achieving our long-term targets. We are focused on effectively deploying our capital through organic growth, strategic investments to increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses, while also returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. We continue to benefit from the robust capital planning process that we\u2019ve developed over a number of years, as evidenced by our recent CCAR results, where our planned capital actions once again received no objection. As part of the capital plan, our Board has authorized the share repurchase program of up to $1.47 million of common stock beginning in the third quarter. Subject to Board approval, plan includes 29% increase in Regions quarterly common stock dividend and $0.09 per share beginning in the third quarter. During the quarter, Regions was recognized by Javelin Strategy & Research as a Trust in Banking Leader award winner, reflecting our reliability in meeting customers\u2019 needs and the confidence our customers have in Regions to look out for their best interests. In addition, Regions also received the Gallup Great Workplace Award for the third consecutive year. These examples illustrate how Regions\u2019 comprehensive approach to providing financial services creates greater value for all of our stakeholders. In summary, our second quarter results reflect a continued execution of our strategic plan and our commitment to our three primary initiatives : growing and diversifying; practicing disciplined expense management; and effectively deploying our capital. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David to cover details of the second quarter. David Turner : Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s get started with the balance sheet and take a look at average loans. In the second quarter, average loan balances remained relatively stable at $80.1 billion. Average balances in the consumer lending portfolio totaled $31.1 billion, a decline of $87 million. Consumer production increased 22%, but this growth was offset by the company\u2019s decision to exit the third-party arrangement within the indirect vehicle portfolio. Excluding this runoff, average consumer loans increased approximately $140 million over the first quarter. Average indirect vehicle balances declined $201 million, or 5% during the quarter. Run-off in the third-party portfolio up $224 million, was partially offset by an increase of $23 million in our dealer financial services portfolio. The third-party portfolio is expected to decline between $500 million and $600 million on a full-year average basis during 2017. Average mortgage balances increased $168 million, or 1% consistent with seasonal increases typically experienced in the second quarter. We expect mortgage production in the second-half of the year to be comparable with the first-half of the year, despite additional declines in refinancing activity. Historically, our mortgage production mix has been weighted more heavily to home purchase versus refinancing activity, and enhancements to our online home loan direct mortgage channel will continue to provide a modest increase in production. Average home equity balances decreased $131 million, or 1%. Growth in average home equity loans of $52 million was offset by a decline of $183 million in average home equity lines of credit. Further, average line utilization decreased 66 basis points compared to the first quarter. Although, home equity balances are declining, the risk profile of the portfolio has improved significantly. We eliminated the interest-only option last year and today approximately 64% of total balances are in a first lien position. We also continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale lending initiatives. This portfolio increased $64 million, or 7% linked-quarter on an average basis. In addition, at the end of the second quarter, we purchased approximately $138 million of unsecured consumer loans, which are included in our other indirect lending portfolio. And we will continue to explore additional opportunities to further expand this portfolio. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio remained relatively stable with the prior quarter, as the number of active cards increased approximately 2%, helping to offset a seasonal decline in outstanding balances. Turning to the business lending portfolio, average balances totaled $49 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $19 million, as growth in commercial and industrial was partially offset by declines in owner occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate construction loans. As Grayson mentioned, we experienced solid production increases during the second quarter, with commercial and investor real estate loan production increasing 56% and 35%, respectively. In addition, commercial line utilization increased 20 basis points and commitments for new loans increased approximately $700 million from the previous quarter. Growth in average commercial and industrial loans was led by new or expanded relationships in government and institutional banking, asset-based lending, financial services, and the real estate investment trust portfolios. However, this growth continues to be offset as we produce exposure in certain instances. For example, average direct energy loans decreased $67 million, or 3% during the quarter and now represent less than 2.5% of total loans outstanding. Average medical office building loans decreased $40 million, or 12%. In addition, investor real estate construction loans decreased $41 million, due in part to our ongoing efforts to better diversify production between construction and term lending. While production is improving, the declines in average owner occupied commercial real estate loans reflect the continued softness in demand and competition for middle market and small business loans. We expect to maintain the momentum experienced this quarter through the second-half of the year, with future growth driven in part by the technology and defense, financial services, power and utilities and asset-based lending portfolios. Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Total average deposits decreased $478 million less than 1% from the previous quarter, while average low-cost deposits decreased $335 million. Total average deposits in the Consumer segment increased $890 million, or 2% in the quarter. And this growth reflects the unique strength of our retail franchise and the overall health of the consumer. Average Corporate segment deposits decreased $581 million, or 2% during the quarter impacted by seasonal declines in public funds deposits. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $496 million, or 5%, as a result of ongoing strategic reductions of collateralized deposits. Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the other segment decreased $291 million, or 8%, driven primarily by declines in average retail brokered sweep deposits. We will continue to manage and optimize our overall deposit base in the context of our balance sheet growth. Let\u2019s take a look at the composition of our deposit base. Second quarter deposit costs remained low at 15 basis points and total funding costs were 34 basis points, illustrating our deposit advantage. As a reminder, our deposit base is more heavily weighted toward retail customers. Approximately, 74% of average interest bearing deposits and 53% of average interest free deposits are considered retail. In addition, we have a loyal customer base, as more than 44% of our consumer low-cost deposits have been deposit customers at Regions for more than 10 years. And finally, approximately 50% of our deposits come from MSAs with less than 1 million people and approximately 35% from MSAs with less than 500,000 people, both are in the top quartile versus our peer group. It\u2019s for these reasons, we believe that our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value and is a competitive advantage, in particular, in a rising rate environment. So let\u2019s look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $904 million in the second quarter, an increase of $23 million, or 3% from the first quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.32%, an increase of 7 basis points. Both net interest margin and net interest income benefited from several factors during the quarter, including higher interest rates and favorable credit-related interest recoveries. Further, one additional day in the quarter benefited net interest income by approximately $5 million, but negatively impacted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect continued growth in net interest income, net interest margin will be stable to up modestly, and this includes the negative impact of one additional day in the quarter and the potential need to issue debt in the near-term. Non-interest income increased $15 million, or 3% in the quarter. This included the recognition of $5 million deferred gain associated with the sale of affordable housing mortgage loans that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an operating lease impairment charge of $7 million recorded during the second quarter, compared to $5 million impairment charge recorded in the first quarter. When indications of possible impairment arise, we evaluate the current value of operating lease assets and record impairment charges when necessary. These impairment charges are recorded as reductions to other non-interest income. Adjusted non-interest income increased $9 million, or 2% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in capital markets income and bank-owned life insurance. Capital markets income increased $6 million, or 19%, as increases in fees generated from Fannie Mae DUS real estate placements and merger and acquisition advisory services were partially offset by declines in revenues associated with debt underwriting and loan syndications. Bank-owned life insurance increased $3 million, as a result of higher claim benefits. Mortgage production increased 25% during the quarter, while mortgage income remained relatively stable within total mortgage production, 80% was related to purchase activity and 20% was related to refinancing. An increase in mortgage servicing income was offset by modest spread compression and lower hedging gain. During the quarter, we completed the purchase of rights to service $2.7 billion of mortgage loans. And including this transaction, we have purchased the rights to service more than $15 billion of mortgage loans over the past four years. And looking ahead, increased servicing income is expected to help offset the impact of lower refinancing volumes. Looking forward, we expect a pickup in capital markets revenue along with modest growth in wealth management, mortgage and card and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the second-half of the year. Let\u2019s take a look at expenses. Total non-interest expenses increased 4% during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $899 million, an increase of $27 million, or 3% compared to the first quarter. Total salaries and benefits increased $19 million and included $10 million associated with a pension settlement charge. Excluding the pension settlement charge, salaries and benefits increased $9 million, or 2% and included a full quarter\u2019s impact of merit increases, as well as increases in production-based incentives. These increases were partially offset by lower payroll taxes and a modest decline in staffing levels. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect higher production-based incentives commensurate with revenue growth. However, we expect total salaries and benefits to decline as pension and settlement charges are not expected to repeat at this level. Professional and legal expenses increased $6 million during the quarter, primarily due to an increase in legal settlement expense. Furniture and equipment expense increased $5 million, primarily associated with capital investment projects, including an enhanced online banking platform and other technology initiatives. As these are now included in our run rate, we expect furniture and equipment expense to remain approximately this level for the remainder of the year. The second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio increased 50 basis points to 63.2% and includes the impact of the pension settlement and operating lease impairment charges. These charges negatively impacted the adjusted efficiency ratio by 100 basis points during the quarter. And despite the negative impact of these charges, we continue to expect the full-year adjusted efficiency ratio to be approximately 62%. With respect to taxes, the effective tax rate improved 90 basis points in the quarter to 29.5%. Now shifting to asset quality, net charge-offs totaled $68 million in the second quarter, a 32% improvement over the first quarter and represented 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $20 million less than net charge-offs. A reduction in non-performing and criticized loans resulted in an allowance for loan and lease losses decline of 3 basis points to 1.3% of total loans outstanding. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio increased to 6.9% in the quarter, compared to 6.1% in the first quarter, reflecting a specific reserve increase related to one oilfield service credit. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale decreased $181 million, or 18% to 1.03% of loans outstanding, driven by broad-based improvement in commercial loans. Total business services criticized loans decreased 7% and total delinquencies decreased 5%. The improvement in criticized loans was primarily due to declines in energy and transportation and warehousing loans. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans, or coverage ratio was 127% at quarter-end. Excluding energy, the coverage ratio increased from 135% to 163% in the second quarter. Total direct energy charge-offs were $18 million during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $31 million. Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $125 million, or 9.1 million shares of common stock and declared $84 million in dividends to common shareholders, resulting in 70% of earnings being returned to shareholders. At the same time, our capital ratios remained robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 12.% and the fully phased in common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at a 11.3%. And finally, our liquidity position remains solid, with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%, and we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter-end. As Grayson mentioned, we are pleased with our CCAR results and remain committed to prudently investing in our businesses for future growth, as well as returning an appropriate level of capital to our shareholders. Turning to our outlook for the balance of 2017, our expectations remain essentially unchanged from last quarter. Excluding the impact of our third-party indirect vehicle portfolio, we expect full-year average loans to be flat to slightly down compared to the prior year. However, looking ahead, we expect to modestly grow average and ending loans on a sequential linked-quarter basis over the second-half of the year. We expect full-year average deposit balances to be relatively stable with the prior year. We expect net interest income another financing income growth of 3% to 5% and full-year adjusted non-interest income growth of 1% to 3%. Total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2017 are expected to increase between zero and 1%, and we remain committed to achieving a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 62%, with positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. We now expect the full-year effective tax rate in the 30% to 31% range, and we expect full-year net charge-offs to remain in the 35 to 50 basis points range. So in summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and remain focused on continuing to execute our strategic plan to drive growth and shareholder value. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. One, I appreciate all the detail on deposits composition that you gave us. And I\u2019m just wondering in the context of your loan-to-deposit ratio, 82%, can you just give us a sense as to where you\u2019re anticipating? What levers you can pull to drive the deposit growth to continue to fund the loan growth? And are you thinking about that loan-to-deposit ratio staying flat, or are you comfortable having it migrate higher? Grayson Hall : Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask David to add to it. One, we\u2019ve had a very thoughtful and prescriptive deposit strategy. And if you look at our deposit composition over the last two or three years, you\u2019ve seen us really drive to create greater diversity in that portfolio, more granularity and less cost And you\u2019ve seen us execute a strategy, where we\u2019ve reduced some of our highest cost deposits. We\u2019ve reduced a substantial amount of deposits that require securities for collateralization. And so we\u2019re very proud of the deposit base we put together. And as rates have started rising, you look at the deposit betas that we\u2019ve been able to learn and we feel good about that. We think the big part of the value, this franchise is a strength of our deposit base. We would actually like to see our loan-to-deposit ratio improve, go up, if you will. We believe that we\u2019ve got the capability and the capacity to fund a great deal of our growth with deposits throughout the communities we operate in. David Turner : Yes, Betsy, I want to add a couple of things. We don\u2019t focus on trying to get to any particular loan deposit ratio. We believe the core of any bank franchise is the ability to attract and retain low-cost core deposit and we are very good at that. Regardless of if our loan-to-deposit ratio was even lower, we send a message to the field every day, all day about attracting low-cost core deposit. That\u2019s just so fundamental to our profitability. That being said, we would love to have those deposits deployed in the loan book versus somewhere else, securities or otherwise. And we\u2019re looking to grow loans as is prudent. And we did a little better this quarter, we\u2019ll talk about loans in a minute. But we have good core funding. We\u2019re ready to grow loans, but we\u2019re not going to force it. We\u2019re going to take what\u2019s out there. Our teams are working hard to grow appropriately, and again, we\u2019re not trying to solve for a given ratio. Grayson Hall : Yes, I mean, we\u2019ve made a very conscious effort to do \u2013 take a different risk appetite on certain of our lending segments, energy and multifamily, medical office building. You\u2019ve seen us do that in auto lending as well. We\u2019ve made some risk changes into our equity lending products that take risk off of that. So we\u2019ve been very thoughtful about what part of our lending portfolio we want to grow. And we feel like, we\u2019ve sort of remixed, both our deposit and our loan balance sheet. So we think, we\u2019re in a very good position to grow. As we said earlier in our prepared remarks, we had over a 20% increase in consumer lending production this quarter and over 50% increase in our commercial lending production. So we think that second-half of the year, we can see much improved numbers. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That makes sense. I was just \u2013 I really like the detail on ID and how much of that is coming retail. And I just \u2013 when I heard your comment about the outlook for issuing some debt, I was a little confused there. Are you looking to hold the LDR flat and issue debt to fund growth? But maybe there\u2019s a different reason why you\u2019re issuing the debt, if you could just explain a little bit? David Turner : Yes, that\u2019s a great question, because we\u2019re really talking about holding the company debt versus bank debt. We \u2013 the liquidity profile of the bank is in great shape, as we just mentioned. We do have some corporate needs too at the holding company that that we need to take care of. The exact timing of that not sure, which quarter that will hit in. It likely be towards the end of the year. So I don\u2019t know that there will be a whole lot of impact from that this year could be some. But the general corporate purposes include things like our share buyback too that we had to think through how we fund that. So that\u2019s really what it\u2019s about. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so it\u2019s more on optimization of capital structure as opposed to any kind of regulatory request? David Turner : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And do you have a sense of the size of the debt issuance? David Turner : We\u2019ve talked about anywhere from $750 to $1 billion range that we would be looking at. Betsy Graseck : Okay, perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes to the outlook for the margin next quarter stable to up modestly. And what are some of the underlying assumptions for your NII and NIM guidance for the year? David Turner : Yes, sure. So before we get to NIM, which is at the result what we talked about NII. So we believe we can continue to grow NII. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we had good production from a loan standpoint. We expect loan growth to be more robust in the second-half of the year than it was in the first-half of the year. We\u2019ve done a good job of controlling our deposit cost. Our deposit costs were up 1%, call that at 10% beta. Thus far, we\u2019re not been able see, it\u2019s been among the lowest of our peer group. And it really gets back to all the discussion we had on our deposit franchise and our beta and our core accrual smaller markets that we get deposits from. So we think that \u2013 the curves helped a little bit. I would tell you on the corporate side, LIBOR starts to move before increases happened. So we did get the June increase. The commercial side of that started to reflect it earlier, because LIBOR moved in advance. We do pickup a little bit more on the consumer side their prime base. Kudos in terms of the probability of the December rate increase, it\u2019s not very high from a profitability standpoint right this minute. But as the market starts to anticipate that LIBOR to move too, I think our outlook really takes into account today\u2019s boards. From a NIM standpoint, we did have 2 basis points that came through NIM this past quarter on recoveries \u2013 credit recoveries. We had guided a three to five. Last quarter, we ended up with seven and the two points really came from that. We don\u2019t forecast those recoveries if they happen, they happen. And so that\u2019s a little piece of the disconnect, where you\u2019re trying to figure out why it\u2019s stable to up modestly. You also have to look at where we are. I mean, we have a \u2013 on a relative basis to our peers, a pretty strong NIM. And when we have the curve, it\u2019s pretty flat. So the profitability of what goes on relative to our existing NIM is even harder. So you don\u2019t see quite the expansion that we\u2019ve had. But if you take out the 2 points that I just mentioned, we should see growth similar to what we saw in the last quarter. John McDonald : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, David, wanted to ask about your updated thoughts on normalizing the equity base and getting that CET 1 to the 9.5% you talked about. I think earlier in the year, you were talking maybe end of 2018, early 2019 getting there. I was wondering if the successful CCAR and the big ask to help you get there faster, or just reinforce your confidence about getting to that target? David Turner : Yes, we put in a plan to get down to that 9.5% by the end of 2018. We\u2019ve mentioned numerous times, we can\u2019t quite get there. We don\u2019t think, at least, it depends on what loan growth looks like over that period of time. We\u2019ll get close. We had anticipated, of course, we knew what our ask was at that time. We just are reluctant about sharing anything specific until our regulatory supervisors have an opportunity to object or not object. And so we\u2019re confident at the submission even though we didn\u2019t know. And we\u2019re confident, we can get to that 9.5 in due time and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to get to our 12% to 14% return on tangible common by then as well. So everything is coming together, as we planned. As we stated in the Investor Day over a year-and-a-half ago, we feel very good about where we\u2019re marching towards that goal at this point in time. John McDonald : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Overall credit quality was quite good. I did notice an increase in the commercial TDRs. And apologies, if I missed, any opening comment on that, but what drove that rise? Grayson Hall : No, I mean, I think, what you saw this quarter is that, we\u2019ve characterized our credit quality as stable. We continue to believe that. There\u2019s some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And then the granularity of that portfolio isn\u2019t quite as small as we\u2019d like. So one or two credits can make a difference and TDRs, that\u2019s the case. There\u2019s one or two energy credits. But I\u2019ll ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer to expand on that. Barb Godin : Thank you, Grayson. And that\u2019s exactly what it was. It\u2019s a small handful few energy credits and an ag credit on the energy side. Of course, we\u2019ve just finished or in the midst of finishing our spring borrowing base redetermination. So there\u2019s some of that and working with out oilfield services. So nothing systemic at all. And in fact, I think that number you will start to see it move down through the balance of the year as well based on what we know. Grayson Hall : Thank you, Barb. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. The investor community seems to be losing a little bit of faith in terms of the revenue outlook for the industry generally, as the year has progressed. And I\u2019m wondering, as you think about your efficiency target first sub-60% for next year \u2013 for the full-year of next year. Is there enough sort of as you look out on the budget and the expense pipeline to continue to support that target even if sort of the rate outlook once again is maybe a little bit short of what we thought it was going to be to begin the year? Grayson Hall : Well, Erika, we -- clearly, we can\u2019t bet on rates. We\u2019ve got to maintain a very disciplined, very rigorous expense management program. We\u2019re absolutely committed to that, we don\u2019t believe. We believe that\u2019s fundamentally the right thing for us to be doing in a low-rate, low-growth economy. We continue to press hard on a number of fronts to make sure that we\u2019re delivering on that. As David said earlier, our personnel expenses quarter-over-quarter, our staffing relatively flat, but we had to absorb merit increases. And also I guess year-over-year, we\u2019re down a little over 300 positions. We have tried to structurally change our expense base and continue to do that. I\u2019m going to ask John Owen, if you\u2019ll speak for just a moment. We continue to rationalize our branch franchise and recently made some announcements that further complete some commitments we made at Investor Day year-and-a-half ago about what we\u2019re going to on branch closures. So, John? John Owen : Good morning. This week we announced consolidation of 22 additional branches. At Investor Day, we made a commitment that we would consolidate between 100 and 150 branches and we\u2019ve got to about 160 right now. Over the last 10 years from our peak between 127 branches is where we peaked. We\u2019re down now about 1,500. So overall, we\u2019re down about 30%. David Turner : And we\u2019re delivering on that 150, which is now at 260, a year early. John Owen : Right. David Turner : And so, I mean, I just used that as an example of where not only we\u2019re trying to reduce expenses, but we\u2019re trying to accelerate the pace of that expense management activity. Erika Najarian : Got it. And as we look forward \u2013 this is a follow-up to John\u2019s line of questioning. Clearly, best-in-class in terms of total payout, as we look forward over the next couple of years, how are you balancing the preference between dividends and buybacks? And over the medium-term, what\u2019s a more normalized dividend payout ratio for your bank and given how \u2013 what you observed of your CCAR results? David Turner : Yes. So it\u2019s a great question. Clearly, we \u2013 it\u2019s critical that we get our common equity Tier 1 and other ratios to follow along with that to an appropriate level of capital for our company and optimized best we can, both in common and preferred \u2013 common items like preferred And I think that we can do that over this fairly short period of time. As you optimize your capital based on the risk within your balance sheet, we do start leaning more towards a higher percentage of our income being paid out in a full dividend. So we had as files our ratio in the 30% to 40% range, that\u2019s moving up in the 35% to 45% range. As time goes, we\u2019ll refine that as well. But I would think that right now based on where we are in the 35% to 45%, would seem to be a reasonable dividend payout ratio for us. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Good morning. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to ask a question on expenses. David, good control again if you take the $909 and then you add the two $10 million items. So if we\u2019re starting it somewhere in the 90-ish type of range, which is, I think around the zone that you had kind of spoken to as possible in the past. Can you just give us an understanding of just seasonality and just and growth from here? How well can you kind of control, given the points you made earlier about the branch plan and other initiatives? Can you keep them pretty tight from here? David Turner : Yes, Ken, it\u2019s a great question, and you did the math exactly right. So you\u2019re \u2013 take that $899 and back out the settlement fees, you get closer to another items you mentioned, you get about where our run rate is. Clearly, we are intently focused on managing our expense base. Grayson mentioned revenue is challenged. Erika brought up revenue being challenged. We get that. We\u2019re not counting on rates to bail us out. And as a result, we are focused on everything expense-related from people, process, technology. And right now, we think that that run right that you mentioned is fairly accurate for us for the remainder of this year. Ken Usdin : Got it. And to your point about adjusting to revenues, last year you had talked about the 300 program, you up that to 400, but you kind of rolled out the timeline of that two. Are there things within the program that you could bring forward if you needed to? So I know you\u2019re focused on it. But how much of that is \u2013 how much optionality is there around timing of those expected saves that you have for \u2013 over the time? David Turner : Yes, as you know, about 60% \u2013 a little over 60% of our \u2013 or right at 60% of o our total expenses is compensation-related. So if you\u2019re going to move the meter on expenses, you\u2019re going to move it based on that. And so being able to \u2013 we have natural attrition as every company does, takes care of a piece of that, trying to change processes up quicker than we otherwise would have done to the piece of that not having to backfill people that attrit is important. As John mentioned, the branch consolidation, so we\u2019ve put 22 on the Board and maybe we don\u2019t consolidate quite at the pace that we have done in the recent history. We continue to look at our retail footprint in terms of consolidations and additions. So for us managing expenses all about optimizing everything that we do and we have a pretty high sense of urgency to get that done. So we\u2019re going to look to bring forward as much as we can. Again, our goal is focusing on getting our return by the end of 2018 in that range of 112% to 14% and expense management is a critical piece of that. Ken Usdin : Es, understood Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. On the efficiency ratio and operating leverage, I know you gave the 2017 expectation of 62% and 2% to 4%. I\u2019m wondering, where do you think that could go for 2018 just given the progress you\u2019ve made on the expense front? I mean, do you think you can get to a 60% level or anything like that in 2018 without the help of rates? And we\u2019re \u2013 or conversely how about with the help of rate? Just curious where you think you you could go? Grayson Hall : Yes, I think that\u2019s kind of where Erika was going with her question too, And clearly, rates matter to the extent that we don\u2019t get increases that we had anticipated that puts a lot more pressure on it \u2013 on us being able to get there. But as we\u2019re talking through all these questions, if the revenue is not there, then it\u2019s going to cause us to have to put even more pressure on our expense base, because we have certain goals that we want to meet and makes it more challenging, makes it more difficult. I can\u2019t say an absolute right now for 2018. We\u2019re in the middle of our strategic planning process, and of course, roll out a new budget towards the end of the year, we\u2019ll give you better guidance into 2018. But we\u2019re committed to doing best we can to get \u2013 ultimately, we believe to be in the 60%, even over time, we think below that. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thanks, David. And then on the credit side, quick one there. The \u2013 I know you bled the reserve about 7 basis points or so this quarter to about 1.26, I believe, in terms of ratio to loan. Curious where you think that to go? Could it go a little lower, I believe, the industry is maybe a little bit below that, but just want to get your thought? Barb Godin : John, it\u2019s Barb Godin. Yes, we moved it from 1.3% last quarter to 1.30% this quarter. We are looking at the reserve, as you know, every quarter. And so there is always opportunity for downward movement. A lot of that is dependent on continued improvement as we\u2019ve seen so far in all of our credit metrics and in particular in our energy portfolio. Grayson Hall : Well, and the composition of the portfolio. All that drives it as we derisk the composition of our portfolio and derisk individual credits within the \u2013 the allowance was done what it ought to do, it\u2019s rationalized to that inherent risk of the portfolio, and we think we continue to see opportunities to improve that. John Pancari : Okay, thanks. One more, I know you said the beta right now on the deposit side is 10% ballpark. What are your assumptions assumed about where that could go over the next one or two like? David Turner : Yes. So I\u2019ll give you some parameters. So we don\u2019t really factor in data for the next quarter. But kind of over the next 12 months, our beta assumptions really haven\u2019t changed. They started 40%, end up at 60% at the terminal pass-through. I think a good guide that you might want to have everybody could use is for every 5 data points, it\u2019s about $8 million for us. So as we get a hike, that could be anywhere from $50 million to $60 million of NII just depending on what happens from a beta standpoint. We do think that the pace of change or pace of rate increases is helpful to keep beta down. But we also are realistic in knowing at some point, we\u2019re going to have to pass-through some of the increase at a faster pace than we have today, which is only 10%. So we think we\u2019re probably a little conservative in terms of our longer-term beta assumption, especially for the next increase or two. Grayson Hall : Well, I mean, the other side of it is, we\u2019re coming from a relatively low position. And thus far, our industry, our competition has been pretty rational on deposit pricing. But with modest loan growth, there we\u2019re seeing modest economic growth. Then you should anticipate modest betas until a point in time that competition for deposits increases. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Moss of FBR. Steve Moss : Good morning. In terms of the loan growth here, it sounds like it\u2019s turning the corner a bit. I was wondering, is this result of pricing or has runoff is getting closer to the bottom here? Grayson Hall : If you look at the economic recovery, fixed business investment has been really modest throughout the recovery. And we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s a combination of confidence and courage and uncertainty. And \u2013 but we saw really good production numbers, particularly in the commercial middle market space last \u2013 this past quarter. And while we still aren\u2019t certain that we\u2019re turning the corner there. We are seeing some encouraging signs and I\u2019ll ask John Turner who runs that business for us to make a few comments, to give you a little bit more detail around it. John Turner : I think that we are in a better place to begin experiencing the loan growth. I think the derisking activities that we\u2019ve undertaken certainly are beginning to slow a bit. We saw good growth in a couple of different industry sectors. Our pipelines remain stable. When I look at our loss business reporting, we had still about $2.5 billion in opportunities over the last six months that we lost these because of our dissatisfaction with pricing or some sort of structural element, some other structural element, as I said with credit, another $700 million or so related to internal limits that we impose on ourselves to ensure that we have good balance and diversity within our loan portfolio. So when you think about production being up over 50% quarter-over-quarter, and yet we still have some opportunity in our pipeline through continued \u2013 just good execution. I think, as portfolio mitigation strategies begin to play out and we don\u2019t have the kind of run-off that we have been experiencing, and assuming that we can turn the tide and run off an owner-occupied real estate. I think we\u2019ll \u2013 we will begin to see some growth particularly as business investment activity, as Grayson suggests, picks up. Our pipelines are pretty stable, economies are still growing slowly in the markets, where we operate. But there are some signs of businesses gaining some confidence, or at least just running out of patience so to speak in deciding they\u2019re going to take some risk that they haven\u2019t been willing to take so far. Steve Moss : Got you. And then on the derisking subjects here, wondering what\u2019s the prospect of moving your 9.5% target down towards 9% or lower, given your balance sheet profile ahead of next year\u2019s CCAR? David Turner : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019m glad you brought it up, because that\u2019s not a static number. The 9.5%, we evaluate that all the time. We look at our risk profile. We think through the derisking that we\u2019ve done. That 9.5% could go both ways. I mean, if we put more risk on the balance sheet, because we decide do something else, we\u2019ll hold appropriate capital for it. But if we derisk continue to derisk the 9.5% goes lower than that, and I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us. We\u2019ve espoused 9.5% and we\u2019ve kind of left it alone at that, because we\u2019re at 11.3. Now let us get the 9%, as we start approaching 9.5%, we\u2019ll give you a better indication as to what \u2013 tighten that up a little bit. But it\u2019ll be over time for us get to that number. Steve Moss : Thank you very much. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. It\u2019s another one on capital. If I look at the DFAST release that was about a 70 basis point GAAP between your common equity Tier 1 and your Tier 1 under stress. But if we look at CCAR that increases to about a 140 basis points with the capital actions. So that seems to suggest that there\u2019s about 70 basis points of preferred issuance baked into that. Just wanted to check that math was correct? David Turner : You did really good math, that\u2019s about where we\u2019ll be we need right at $700 million of preferred over time to bolster our Tier 1, which we\u2019re solving through common equity. So, our capital regime is really about getting the capital down to the appropriate level, but optimizing this fact as well. So we want to solve the common equity Tier 1 with common equity obviously non-common needs to be a component of that, it\u2019s cheaper than our cost of common today and you\u2019ve nailed it. Geoffrey Elliott : And then, I get clearly that preferred is cheaper than common. But why issue any preferred at all when those capital actions post stress you\u2019re still at 7.4% that\u2019s still a long way ahead of the, I think, it\u2019s a 6% minimum per preferred of the total Tier 1 under stress and CCAR why issue any preferred at all? David Turner : Well, we won\u2019t. And we will \u2013 we\u2019re going to wait as long as we can, because we don\u2019t want to have the negative carry. And we\u2019ll do that in conjunction with the whole optimization and rightsizing. So timing is critically important to us and we\u2019ve got that timing down path. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just lastly, are you committed to assuring that now, now that\u2019s gone into the CCAR ask? And barring any resubmission or anything like that, so you kind of balance to issue non-preferred? David Turner : To the extent that we have \u2013 so our commitment is to have an appropriate amount of capital common equity Tier 1, as well as Tier 1. And if we\u2019re solving Tier 1 with common equity, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s regulatory supervisor that hears that you solve that with that type of capital instrument. So we don\u2019t have to issue of non-common instrument, preferred instrument unless we\u2019re taking our common out as well at the same time. So we\u2019re not forced to have negative periods, where I think we\u2019re going. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you very much. David Turner : Okay. Operator : I\u2019m sorry, go ahead with your concluding remarks. Grayson Hall : Well, that\u2019s being our last question, we really appreciate everyone\u2019s time. We thank you for your attendance today. I appreciate your interest in Regions Financial, and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Before we get started, I want to take a few minutes to speak about the hurricanes that richly impact our footprint. I am immensely proud our team responded and met the needs of our customers, fellow associates and our surrounding communities. Due to our market locations, we unfortunately have significant experience dealing with severe weather related events, immediately following the storms. Our first priority was ensuring the safety of our associates in the impacted areas. While several associates were personally affected, we are extremely grateful that none were injured. In total, 482 banking offices across 100 counties and six states were impacted by the storms. But because of our strong processes and experience teams, we reopened 95% of them within three days following each storm. With the exception of one branch that sustained significant damage, all banking offices are open and conducting business. Our focus remains on helping our customers, associates and communities begin to recover and to rebuild. And while we are still evaluating the financial impact of these storms, David will provide you with our related loss estimate shortly. Keep in mind historically following similar weather events we typically experienced a pickup in economic activity associated with reconstruction efforts along with overall deposit growth. Despite the impact from the hurricanes, we reported solid earnings available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $296 million during the quarter. With earnings per share of $0.25, while generating positive operating leverage, expanding our net interest margin and producing solid growth in pretax pre-provision income. Importantly, we remain focused on expanding our customer base, as we believe is fundamental to future income generation. This quarter we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards, Wealth Management relationships, total assets under management and Consumer loans. We continue to benefit from our asset sensitive balance sheet, as strong deposit franchise, which drove an 8% year-over-year increase in net interest income and a 30 basis point increase in net interest margin. We continue to make strides in our efforts to control expenses, adjusted non-interest expenses decreased $32 million or 4% year-over-year as efficiency remains a top priority of our team. As it relates to loan portfolio, several factors impacted balances this quarter. New and renewed loan production increased 9% year-over-year. However, consistent with the rest of the industry borrowers access to capital markets to a larger degree this quarter which led elevated loan payoffs and loan pay downs. Furthermore, we continue to execute our deliberate diversification strategy focused on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. While these decisions pressure loan growth in the near-term, we believe it is a right long-term strategy and a prudent approach to creating a balanced portfolio, positioning well for future loan growth, with respect to asset quality, our disciplined approach to credit continues to deliver positive results, although uncertainty regarding the impact of the hurricanes remains, we continue to characterize overall credit quality as stable. Regarding efficiency, we recognize the slow growth environment could persist for some time, and therefore, we remain focused on what we can control. Our plan to eliminate $400 million in expenses is well underway. However, we now expect to achieve the majority of these eliminations by 2018 rather than 2019. Through our work in this area we are implementing steps to simplify and grow the bank, which will allow us to significantly improve efficiencies and effectiveness throughout the organization. We believe there is an opportunity for expense eliminations beyond the $400 million. To that end, additional efforts are underway and we will provide more information later this year. With that, I will turn it over to David to cover details of the third quarter. David Turner : Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Now let\u2019s get started with the balance sheet and take a look at average loans. In the third quarter, average loan balances declined to $79.6 billion as growth in the consumer lending portfolio was offset by declines in the business lending portfolio. Total new and renewed loan production remained strong for the quarter and approximated $16.2 million. Within Consumer, we continue to reshape our indirect lending portfolios with a focus on increasing overall risk-adjusted returns. This is evidenced by our decision to exit a third-party indirect auto contract, while expanding our indirect other Consumer portfolio through point-of-sale offerings. As a result, average balances in the consumer lending portfolio increased $180 million or 1% quarter-over-quarter, despite the strategic runoff in the indirect vehicle portfolio. Excluding this runoff, average Consumer loans increased approximately $385 million. Average indirect vehicle balances declined $180 million or 5% during the quarter. Runoff in the third-party portfolio of $205 million was partially offset by an increase of $25 million in our dealer financial services portfolio. The full year average impact of the runoff portfolio is expected to be approximately $510 million. Our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale lending initiatives, continues to experience growth. Average balances increased $257 million or 26% linked quarter aided by the purchase of approximately $138 million of unsecured consumer loans late in the second quarter. Average mortgage balances increased $171 million or 1% during the quarter. However, growth continues to be constrained by lack of housing supply across our footprint. With respect to home equity lending, average balances continue to decline during the quarter, decreasing $134 million or 1% as growth in average home equity loans of $44 million was offset by a decline of $178 million in average home equity lines of credit. Further, average line utilization decreased 68 basis points, compared to the second quarter. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $36 million or 3%, as a number of active cards increased approximately 2.5%. Turning to the business lending portfolio, average balances totaled $48.3 billion in the third quarter, a 1% decline from the second quarter, despite a 1% increase in total new and renewed production. As Grayson mentioned, we experienced elevated loan payoff and pay downs. In particular, many customers in the large Corporate space access the fixed income market taking advantage of favorable pricing spreads, using those proceeds to pay down or payoff bank debt. The level of payoffs and pay downs was 1.5 times higher than the previous quarter and just over 50% higher than the third quarter of last year, a number of investor real estate loans paid off prior to maturity, reflecting the impact of low capitalization rates and a modest increase in mergers and acquisitions was observed in the middle market space, further contributing to elevated loan payoffs. In addition, the decline in average owner-occupied commercial real estate loans reflects continued softness in demand and competition for middle market and small business loans. As part of our risk mitigation strategy, we continue to reduce exposure in certain industries and asset classes. For example, average direct energy loans decreased $52 million or 3% ending the quarter at $1.9 billion or approximately 2.4% of total loans outstanding. Average multifamily loans decreased $58 million or 4% during the third quarter and average medical office building loans decreased $24 million or 8%. In addition, average investor real estate construction loans declined $195 million, due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve diversification between construction and term lending. While these risk mitigation strategies have impacted average loan growth, we believe they are appropriate and will position us well for prudent and profitable loan growth in the future, while maintaining an appropriate credit risk profile. Evidence these strategies are working include, continued declines and expected loss estimates across all business lending categories, improving our relevance and profitability within the shared national credit book or capital recycling efforts have also reduce both the probability of default and expected loss estimates by approximately 10%. The company has reviewed approximately $33 billion of large shared national credit exposures since 2016, and as a result, we exited $4.2 billion of credit and added new or expanded existing relationships of $4.6 million. These expanded relationships provide average trailing annual revenues that are 51% higher than all other shared national credit relationships. Average trailing annual non-interest revenues that are 123% higher and average risk-adjusted returns on capital that are 252 basis points higher. With respect to loan growth, while current pipelines are higher than they have been all year, line utilization reductions and payoffs experienced quarter have tempered expectations. As a result, full year average loan balances, excluding the impact of third-party indirect vehicle runoff are expected to be down slightly. However, based on what we know today and borrowing another quarter of elevated payoffs, we expect loans to grow in the fourth quarter on an end-to-end basis. Let\u2019s move on to the deposits. Similar to loans we also continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base, focusing on valuable low cost Consumer deposits, while reducing higher cost brokered and collateralized deposits. Total average deposits decreased less than 1% during the quarter, primarily due to our strategic decision to reduce higher cost deposits. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $276 million or 3% as a result of ongoing strategic reductions of collateralized deposits. Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities continue to shift out of deposits and into other fee income producing customer investments. Average deposits in the other segment decreased $220 million or 7% driven primarily by our strategy to reduce retail broker suite deposits. Average deposits in the Consumer segment experienced a seasonal decline of $153 million, while average Corporate segment deposits increased $23 million. We continue to expect full year average deposits to remain relatively stable with the prior year. Let\u2019s take a look at the composition of our deposit base. Third quarter deposit costs remain low at 17 basis points and total funding cost were 37 basis points, illustrating our deposit advantage. As a reminder, our deposit base is more heavily weighted towards retail customers, approximately 75% of average interest bearing deposits and 51% of average interest free deposits are considered retail. In addition, we have a loyal customer base, as more than 43% of our consumer low cost deposits have been deposit customers at Regions for more than 10 years. And finally, approximately 50% of our deposits come from MSAs with less than 1 million people and approximately 35% from MSAs with less than 500,000 people, both are in the top quartile versus our peer group. For these reasons, we believe that our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value. It is a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. Now let\u2019s take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $921 million, representing an increase of $17 million or 2% from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.36%, an increase of 4 basis points. Interest recoveries continued to benefit net interest income, adding $4 million and 2 basis points of net interest margin relative to the second quarter. After normalizing for recoveries, net interest margin and net interest income benefit primarily from higher market interest rates, driven by the June Fed funds rate hike, partially offset by a decrease in average loan balances and higher interest expense associated with our holding company debt issuance early in the third quarter. Further, one additional day in the quarter benefited net interest income by approximately $5 million, but negatively impacted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and excluding the impact of interest recoveries, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to grow modestly, in line with market expectations for December Fed funds rate increase. For the full year, we continue to expect net interest income growth in the 3% to 5% range. Before we move on, I want to make a couple of points about our asset sensitive, given the extended low rate environment, the majority of our balance sheet has essentially re-priced. As a result, our natural reinvestment of fixed-rate loans and securities even at current interest rate levels will be accretive from here. So even if interest rates remain low, our balance sheet is position to deliver continued growth in net interest income. Let\u2019s move on to non-interest income, adjusted non-interest income decreased $13 million or 3% during the quarter, driven primarily by declines in mortgage and capital markets income, partially offset by an increase in service charges. In addition, the company incurred $10 million of operating lease impairments during the third quarter, compared to $7 million incurred in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have incurred $22 million in operating lease impairment charges, primarily attributable to oilfield services customers. Mortgage income decreased $8 million or 20% during the quarter. Despite a 9% decline in mortgage production, sales revenue increased $1 million or 4%, primarily due to improved secondary marketing gains. However, this increase was offset by $9 million reduction in the valuation of residential mortgage servicing rights. Capital markets income decreased $3 million or 8% driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory services, and loan syndication income, partially offset by higher revenues associated with debt underwriting. Card and ATM fees were negatively impacted by the hurricanes, as the estimated impact of fee waiver was approximately $1 million in the quarter. However, service charges increased $6 million or 4% during the quarter, aided by continue checking account growth, new now banking accounts and higher mobile deposit revenue. Wealth Management income remained relatively unchanged during the quarter. Of note, our wealth team recently launched the Regions\u2019 wealth platform through its partnership with SEI Global Services. This new and enhanced platform is expected to benefit all customers across the wealth space, including private wealth, institutional services and asset management, with best-in-class online experience, while also increasing operational efficiencies. Similarly, in an effort to improve our customer experience through innovation, we were in the process of rolling out a new iTreasury platform. This should enhance the customers experience and further expand our product capabilities. We also announced this week plans to expand person-to-person payments and account to account transfer solutions through our partnership with Fiserv. We will add Turnkey Service Brazil and Transfer Now capabilities in the first half of 2018, providing an enhanced and seamless customer experience across all payment types. With respect to future non-interest income, we expect growth in capital markets revenue next quarter as several transactions originally expected to close in the third quarter are now expected to close in the fourth. In addition, we expect a modest increase in Mortgage, Wealth Management and card and ATM fees to collectively contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year adjusted non-interest income to remain relatively stable with the prior year. Let\u2019s move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis expenses were well-controlled in the third quarter, decreasing $19 million or 2%, compared to the second quarter. Total salaries and benefits decreased $14 million or 3%, primarily due to reduced pension settlement charges and lower health insurance costs. Professional fees decreased $7 million during the quarter, associated with lower legal and consulting costs. Provision for unfunded credit losses also decreased $5 million during the quarter. These declines were partially offset by $5 million increase in occupancy and a $7 million increase in other real estate expenses related to branch damage, hurricane preparedness and other storm-related charges. Despite the impacts of operating lease impairments, pension settlements and hurricane-related charges, the adjusted efficiency ratio improved 150 basis points to 61.7% during the quarter. We continue to expect the full year adjusted efficiency ratio to be approximately 62%. The company also produced solid growth in pretax pre-provision income, increasing 4% compared to the second quarter and 12% compared to the third quarter of the prior year on an adjusted basis. For the first nine months of 2017 the company generated positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis of just over 1%, reflecting growth and adjusted total revenue of 1.5%, offset by 0.3% increase in adjusted non-interest expense. We expect full year adjusted operating leverage of approximately 2%. With respect to taxes, the effective tax rate increased 140 basis points in the quarter to 30.9% and our full year guidance for the effective tax rate remains unchanged in the 30% to 31% range. Shifting to asset quality, excluding the impact of the hurricanes, we experienced another good quarter from the credit perspective. Non-performing, criticized and trouble debt restructured loans continue to improve. Non-performing loans decline $63 million, resulting in an NPL ratio of 0.96%. We also reported a 10% and 8% decline in business services criticized and total trouble debt restructured loans, respectively. These declines were primarily driven by improvement in commercial loans. Net charge-offs totaled $76 million in the third quarter or 38 basis points of average loans. This represents an $8 million increase over the second quarter and includes the impact of two large energy credits. For the first nine months of 2017, net charge-offs represented 41 basis points of average loans. We continue to expect full year net charge-offs to be in the 35 basis point to 50 basis point range. As Grayson mentioned, it\u2019s too early to assess the full impact of the hurricanes, generally it takes up to nine months to fully evaluate storm-related losses. We are still gathering available intelligence, including direct communications with customers where possible to determine potential losses resulting from the storms. As you would expect, our loss estimate includes a significant amount of uncertainty. Based on our current evaluations, we have provided for an incremental reserve of $40 million for loan losses. Including the incremental reserve, the provision for loan losses match net charge-offs for the third quarter. The resulting allowance for loan losses at quarter end increased 1 basis point to 1.31% of total loans outstanding. We continue to characterize overall credit quality is stable. However, volatility from quarter-to-quarter in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially as it relates to large dollar commercial credits, fluctuating commodity prices and further analysis and revisions to hurricane-related exposures. Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter we repurchased $500 million or 34.6 million shares of common stock and declared $105 million in dividends to common shareholders, an aggressive start to our recently approved capital plan. We see the compounding benefit of executing repurchases early, but also understand the need to retain some flexibility throughout the year. Our resulting capital ratios remain robust. Under Basel III the Tier 1 capital ratios was estimated at 12.1% and the fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.2%. Finally, our liquidity position remains solid, with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81% and we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter end. Regarding expectations, while 2017 has been challenging in many respects, we still expect to meet our overall profitability targets for the year. We are able to accomplish this because our asset sensitive balance sheet continues to benefit from increasing interest rates, including the benefit of our core deposit base and at the same time we are continuing to exercise solid expense management. I have provided an update on each of these targets on the previous pages of deck. Those updates are summarized again on this slide for your reference. So in conclusion, despite the negative impacts from recent hurricanes, we reported solid third quarter results and remained focused on continuing to execute our strategic plan to drive growth and shareholder value. And to end, as Grayson mentioned, we expect to achieve the majority of the $400 million expense eliminations by 2018, one year ahead of schedule and are committed to achieving additional expense reductions over and above the $400 million amount, and we look forward to providing additional details to you later this year. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : Good morning. I was just curious how much is left in terms of the balance sheet repositioning on the commercial side and in indirect auto? David Turner : And in -- so in indirect auto, that runoff usually takes about two and half years runoff. It cost us somewhere in the $500 million range as we mentioned, so we just now finished about a year, so we have about a year and half round number, Peter. Peter Winter : Okay. And on the commercial side? David Turner : So we think about repurposing, we got -- round numbers we had talked about another $1 billion that we were looking at. The truth is we continue to see opportunities to look at all of our relationships as they continue to come through and mature, and so it\u2019s hard to explain to you exactly how much in terms of runoff would occur, it\u2019s really the opportunity to look at a lot of large corporate relationships as they come up for renewal. John Turner : Yeah. Peter, this is John Turner. I would say that, our expectation was that we would begin to see inflection point in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Obviously we were surprised by the amount of pay downs in the third quarter and just the amount of liquidity has float into the bank. The timing of the transition from building or from becoming less dependent on construction lending, particularly in real estate and matching that with an increase in term lending has been all slower than we thought. We do see that pipeline now building and so believe that we will grow loans based upon what we know today, grow loans on an end-to-end basis in the fourth quarter. Our pipelines are stronger, our production has improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and so we believe we are beginning to see some momentum building in the loan portfolio based upon what we know today. Peter Winter : Got it. And just a quick follow question, of the $400 million in planned expenses, how much of you realized so far? Grayson Hall : We had talked about a $300 million we will -- that we found and the extra $100 million, which got us to the $400 million we will find by 2019. We\u2019ve now updated that guidance to tell you we will find the majority of that extra $100 million in 2018. But we want to reserve kind of including our 2018 looks like for later part of the year, because there are investments that we were making. There\u2019s investments in technology in particular and so in the -- in December we will give you better guidance in terms of what that means for 2018. And we\u2019re also looking beyond the $400 million over the next three years, \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820, we will give you guidance on that in December as well. Peter Winter : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Michael. Michael Rose : Hey. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the expense question, can you just remind us what areas of the expense base the $400 million is going to come from. Then maybe just a follow-up on that the $400, how much you think will be on a net basis when you mentioned some investments? Thanks. David Turner : Yeah. I will answer the last question. We really want to reserve that Michael for December, because we are continuing to finalize our budget, our strategic plan for the next three years. So we will have a better net response to you then. As we think about, how we are going to simplify and grow our bank, really looking at all processes that we have, starting with how we serve the customer all the way to how back office enables the front office to deliver our product and service. Our goal is really to simplify how our customers bank with us and how our associates serve our customers. So it is a broad base initiatives that we will be looking at how we can leverage technology to get more efficient and to have a more effective responses in many areas, and so we continue to look at branches as we\u2019ve done, we have consolidated more branches and any peer since the crisis and we look at a lot of square footage even outside of the branch in terms of opportunities for saving. So it\u2019s is pretty broad base. Grayson Hall : Yeah. Michael, I think, that just to reiterate what David said, we continue to look at how we can do business more efficiently and still making sure we are doing business effectively. And as David mentioned, part of that strategy has been in our channels, in our culture channels and year-over-year our branches are down almost 7%. We\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in trying to rationalize our physical points of presence. We\u2019ve also been very judicious in looking at all of our operational processes to try to streamline those to make a more efficient. We just invested in some technologies, it have allowed us to continue to reduce our staffing levels to be more efficient. We work very diligently with all of our vendor partnerships to try to rationalize our expanded -- expenditure with third parties and you going to see us continue to keep expense management at a really high-level of focus and priority over the next several quarters. It\u2019s an imperative in the slow low rate, slow growth environment. David Turner : Yeah. Michael, let me add one another thing, you know what our goal is with regards to efficiency in 2018. And as Grayson just mentioned, our expectations are to do what we have to achieve that -- those expectations that we laid out at our Investor Day, regardless of the environment that might be ahead of us in a slow growth whether rates are up or down or whether they are up or flat, and so that that\u2019s what our reason for focusing on the expense initiative. Michael Rose : Thanks, David. That\u2019s actually I was trying to get at. And maybe just my follow-up, you guys have a decent provision for the hurricanes this quarter, if I go back to Katrina, since you guys took about $100 million and the loss came in a lot less than that. Should that same dynamic occur here, should we think about the future pace of provisioning to be more in line with loan growth and you basically growing to that excess provisioning, is that the right way to think about it? Barb Godin : Yeah. This is Barb Godin. I wouldn\u2019t call an excess provisioning, what we do is then we look at the Hurricane Katrina of course being a very different hurricane than the three that we experienced, including a lot of the rules and regs, and help you got money back in Katrina and what happens. But we take a very methodical approach to sizing up our exposure could be to the hurricanes, not just on the physical exposure but we reach out to customers, we reach out to other, we use the third-party service to help us do some reconnaissance work, et cetera. And so we come up with what our best estimate is recognizing the hurricane came in at the end of the quarter, the best estimate at this point as you know was about $40 million. We are going to continue to refine that. As David said, it will take us roughly over the next nine months for us to fully get that number result, but we will have much more clarity even as we move into next quarter on that number. And so far as the rest of our allowance goes, we fill customer with the methodology that we use around our where we set allowance for the company. So again, we certainly don\u2019t count on any bleed over from something like hurricane. David Turner : I do thank\u2026 Michael Rose : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. David Turner : \u2026for Barb comments that, every day we are learning a little bit more from our customers and obviously the more information that we get from customers and communities, the more refined our estimates are for those losses. And historically, as Barb mentioned, within about a nine month period we got a great degree of certainty about what that potential is. We\u2019ve taken what we believe to be disciplined and prudent approach of what we\u2019ve done this quarter, but for certainty we have got a lot of play out. Michael Rose : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Matt. Rob Hansen : Good morning. This is Rob from Matt\u2019s team. Just on expenses versus your adjusted expense number of [ph] $80 (39:15), I was just curious, how should we think about the 4Q level and then how much of the specific items that you called out this quarter should expect to be repeated this quarter and thereafter, specifically the hurricane related expenses, branch consolidation charges, et cetera? Grayson Hall : Yeah. We had a very solid quarter from an expense management standpoint. I think you got a look at the hurricane and the expenses that we incurred both direct and through the expense categories and addressing the hurricanes, but also the provisioning we took as well. So, David, if you want to try to frame that. David Turner : Yeah. So, I think, that, clearly, as we mentioned the hurricanes, three of them happened right here at the end of the quarter, so we did our best to estimate losses both on the credit side, as well as the non-credit side. We will have some adjustments in the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t expect those to be many great magnitude thus far based on what we know today. And as we think about expenses, we still are within our guidance that we provided at the end of the year that we would be less than 1%, we have given you a guidance that we believe our operating leverage for the year will be approximating 2%. So, I think, your questions also leading into what it\u2019s look like for \u201818 and I am just going to ask you to be little patience until we get to December and we will give you a better net number for both \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820. Grayson Hall : Just to look at the third quarter and when we have hurricanes like this we dispatched off a lot of our team members with supplies and generators and so forth. We have a lot of payers. We have a lot of expenses occur when these events happen and our response to them and then we\u2019ve also taken a very supportive stance on waiving fees and so forth during the event period to try to accommodate our customers getting through these tough situations. And so, but in spite of that we still posted up a really solid quarter from an expense management perspective. Rob Hansen : Okay. And then just separately with regards to the NIM and net interest income beyond 4Q, how you are thinking about your ability to grow net interest income dollars next year ex the benefit of any additional rate hikes? David Turner : Yeah. So provided a little bit of guidance in terms of where our balance sheet is currently positioned right now with regards to even rates where they are as we have fixed rate loans maturing that and securities are rolling over that we can reinvest to have some accretion in net interest income and resulting margin. We do believe if we mentioned that we will grow loans in the fourth quarter we will give you guidance in terms of loan growth relative to 2018 again in December. But we expect to continue to benefit without a rate increase and of course, the probability of December increase is in the plus 80% right now which is why we gave you the guidance on NIM in the fourth quarter to be up modestly. Rob Hansen : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe back to the efficiency ratio, because I think it\u2019s important to clarify, the target from the Investor Day of adjusted efficiency ratio less than 60%. You said that that still stands the full year 2018, just wanted to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page on that? David Turner : Yeah. That\u2019s correct. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. And then in terms of the expense initiatives that you\u2019ve run so far, I guess, there is always a trade-off between saving expenses and avoiding a negative impact on revenues. Is there anything that you\u2019ve done so far that stands out as having been particularly effected in that trade-off, just some color around that might help us think about, how we look at expenses going forward and when most aids can come from? Grayson Hall : Yeah. Probably the biggest impact is -- has been how we have sort of rationalize not only our physical footprint in terms of numbers of branches, but also how we format those branches from a staffing perspective and In will ask John Owen to speak to that just a moment. John Owen : Sure. Our Investor Day few years ago we laid out plan to consolidate say 100 and 150 branches over a three-year period. We beat that. We are about 163 branches right now at the end of two years, so we are in advance to that. As Grayson said, at the same time, we have also rolled out a new online and mobile banking platform. Good thing I point out in the face of consolidations on the consumer side, we continued to grow revenue from customer accounts, grow deposits and grow loans. So even with the branch consolidation, I think, we are having a very balanced approach both on the digital side and with physical branch side. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Moss of FBR. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Steve. Steve Moss : Good morning. I was wondering on your end of period loan growth commentary, if you could help give some color around what your expectations of the drivers are for the fourth quarter growth here? John Turner : Yeah. So, this is John Turner, again. I would say, first of all, our markets were, probably, some of the slowest to recover in the country when we look at GDP and over the last two years we\u2019ve had some headwinds as we thought about trying to remix our business. We have also had to deal with energy recession, concerns about multifamily and our desire to change our mix of business. All that came together to have a probably larger than might expected impact on loan growth. As we look forward what we are beginning see is market strengthening and so in our core businesses our portfolios are improving and some of ours specialized businesses like tech and defense, like financial services, we are seeing a good bit of activity in those markets and so pipelines are strengthening and then our Regions business capital asset based lending platform is active and we expected to have a good year in 2018. And so as we look at our pipelines, we look across our markets, we are seeing strengthening in those economies and we are seeing, frankly, better execution amongst our teams, which we believe is going to lead to again some positive momentum, given what we know today. Steve Moss : That\u2019s helpful. And then where does the -- what\u2019s the balance of your shared national credit as of September 30th? David Turner : The actual balance is effectively unchanged. I think our commitments are in the range of $38 billion, outstandings roughly $19 billion, commitments are up modestly, outstandings are down a little year-over-year, couple $100 million, but we have generally tried to hold those balances about flat and are again remixing the business exiting some relationships, as David pointed out, entering others as we see opportunities to be more relevant and to gain more of our customers\u2019 share wallet. Steve Moss : And one last one if I may, just wondering where you are looking to invest in the franchise in 2018 as we think about expenses here? David Turner : Yeah. So we\u2019ve mentioned quite a few technology investments in our prepared comments in terms of helping our customers, helping guess our customers bank easier with us and helping our associates serve our customers. So you are going to continue to see investments in digital, will be a big investment that we need to have. And I think the whole simplify and grow the bank, again a lot of initiatives there in terms of process. So we think technology will enable us to have more efficient and effective processes through that implementation, which is going to cost us a little bit of money, which is why we don\u2019t want to answer the question for \u201818 just yet. Grayson Hall : But you will see\u2026 Steve Moss : All right. Grayson Hall : You will see us as we go through our simplify and grow initiatives, we want to try to continue to enhance and strengthen the customer experience. We also want to try to find more ways to create more effectiveness and more efficiency in the back office, in particular in risk and compliance and we believe there\u2019s technology solutions that will allow us to do a better job in risk and compliance through robotics and artificial intelligence, we believe some of those investments we are making really find a way to make us not only do a better job, but do that job in more streamline manner. Steve Moss : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. I had a follow up on the discussion, I think, David, you were mentioning, how the front book is coming in better than a back book, were you speaking about the overall portfolio, so that would reflect some mix shift of where you\u2019re generating some of your incremental assets? What was that more specific around? What you\u2019re seeing in your securities book at current yields and what you\u2019re seeing in a C&I and CRE. Can you just give us some color there on would be helpful? David Turner : Yeah. Betsy, it\u2019s actually both of those. We are looking at the total portfolio, the fixed rates that are -- that exist on both in consumer and in the business side, as well as the securities book that rolls over every month, and so it is a combination of those two or literally three things that we believe will help us be accretive in terms of net interest income even if rates stay kind of where they are. Betsy Graseck : And how you are thinking about NIM in that situation, I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve got deposit betas that are beginning to rise here, so what\u2019s your thought on that? David Turner : Well, we\u2019ve -- so we do believe that as rates continue to increase in the face of that, those rates increase deposit betas will also increase. We\u2019ve been fortunate thus far our deposit beta is around 10% thus far, quarter-over-quarter we were about 14%, but like beta about 10%. We believe this is a unique advantage for Regions and that our deposit base SKUs to our retail depositors where in smaller markets we\u2019re in those markets where deposit costs or deposit pricing is less sensitive and that we will have a better deposit beta relative to our peers consistent with what we experience last up cycle. So we think there\u2019s continued benefit for us to actually extract the value out of our deposit franchise as we finally getting rate increase. Betsy Graseck : And then just on, again the front book, back book question, are you also suggesting that spread in C&I and CRE, and three other asset classes are stabilizing here or is there yields are up enough to offset any spread compression? Grayson Hall : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. So spreads clearly have tightened up since a year ago. That\u2019s why you saw not just with Regions but a lot of our peers with access to the capital markets, that\u2019s why you saw our $1 billion issuance in the third quarter, a little earlier than we had originally intended, because of that spread tightening. I think there\u2019s still a lot of competition out there. Spreads are down, not down dramatically from a year ago, call it 9 basis points across the board, different asset classes and I think that we don\u2019t have an expectation that that will continue to grind down, but I don\u2019t see it evident of massive reversal either. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly, NIM, your commentary about 4Q going up, not making any commentary about NIM for 2018 yet, but NII moving higher that that\u2019s the takeaway? Grayson Hall : That\u2019s correct. Consistent with the expectation\u2026 Betsy Graseck : Increment\u2026 Grayson Hall : \u2026 December rate increase, that\u2019s right. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Understanding your comments about potential volatility to come post hurricane on the credit front, just given that this quarter was the biggest energy charge-off quarter you had, you had 10% reductions in almost every metric of non-performers, classifieds, TDRs, et cetera. Could you just help us understand what your underlying trajectory looks to be for losses, any reason to expect any change in the loss rate and can we still continue to see ongoing reserve leases from here given all that? Barb Godin : Good morning, Ken. It\u2019s Barb. Relative to the charge-offs. You are right. We did have a $28 million energy charge-off quarter. That was oilfields services primarily we are seeing an end coming to that book. I think you will start to see that over the coming quarters, but the energy itself in E&P and other sectors is really played itself out little bit of oilfield services left. Relative to improvements in things like our non-performing loans out of our top 11 credits eight of them were actually payoff that came which was -- and it was very broad base. There was only one that was energy and the rest were just a mix of everything else. That was good to see 90-day delinquency behave, criticize classified. We talked about it, et cetera. So all in as we think about where credit is, is stable for the time being and in terms of the allowance obviously as you hear me say, we follow a mythology -- methodology and as things get better in our book, the allowance will as well. But we again don\u2019t anticipate the allowance that were going down, for example, at 1%, et cetera, but there could be some room for improvement in the allowance ratio. Ken Usdin : Yeah. And I was just going to say that, hopefully, you start to see some loan growth from here and have to provide a little bit, but it would just seem with these metrics that you\u2019d be at least offsetting that with ongoing improvement and related releases? Barb Godin : You are right. But, again, both Mr. Turner and Mr. Owen are working very hard as is the rest of the company to make sure that the growth story is going to be a great story for us particularly as we look forward over the next few quarters and well enough to release as much in my allowance, because we will be offsetting those loan growth. Ken Usdin : Okay. Understood. Thank you, Barb. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : My question really revolve around the energy book. Barb, do you think that energy book is bottomed at this point or do you think we will continue to see some contraction? Barb Godin : In terms of, let me go with outstandings first, I think, you are going to see some contraction in our oilfield services, loan balances will continue to decline somewhat. In our midstream we are happy with that part of the book. You are going to actually see us growing that part of the book. Same thing with E&P. There is opportunities in there. Relative to the credit quality cases, again, the only key step, we really still think, time and attention on is the oilfield services piece. That too again, as I mentioned, this quarter we saw lot come through this quarter and I think that too is resulting itself pretty quickly. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Grayson Hall : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Just wanted to -- on the topic of capital, wanted to see how you would -- as you looking at the deployment, how would you prioritize M&A in the grand scheme of things? And then also on that front would you -- how do you view whole bank M&A versus non-bank deals? And then, lastly, what would you be your target as deals if you were to look at anything on the bank side? Thanks. Grayson Hall : John, first of all, our focus right now is primarily call trying to execute on our fundamentals, grow the bank organically, manage expenses with an off a lot of focus and attention and deliver on the numbers that we have tried to project to you in our Investor Day and attract very closely with. As David mentioned, we will give you an idea sort of what we think in 2018, 2018 looks like in December. I think that when you look at the options we got in deploying our capital we first and foremost would look to deploy in the loan growth, as Barb had mentioned earlier, and of course, John Turner and John Owen are both pushing hard inside the company to do that and do it prudently. We have executed on number of non-bank acquisitions that that we think have been of a size and nature that has been accretive to our. We continue to look for those where they are at. We also monitor the bank M&A market very closely. We look at that. We look for when the economics of that makes sense for our company, but quite frankly and then quite candidly, right now, that\u2019s not the primary focus of ours. We just don\u2019t see that wonderful opportunity at this juncture. Those that could change. The map could change on that. The economics can change. But for right now we don\u2019t see that as a tremendous opportunity for our company. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks, Grayson. And then on the margin front, the deposits that you\u2019ve been allowing to runoff the higher cost deposits, sorry if I missed this, but what is the average cost of what you have been running off? Thanks. Grayson Hall : Hey. I don\u2019t have that John in front of me. We think about though is, we have collateralized deposits that don\u2019t provide us much liquidity value at all, because we\u2019ve had to post securities for that, give us a little bit of diversification if you will from things like the FHLB. But when we have and let just call it Wealth Management or trust deposit where our customers are really looking for a better deal and we are willing to give them. We don\u2019t want that deposit that that really is going to show more of 100% beta as rates move and so we are sitting here with a loan deposit ratio of 81%, 82% and it just doesn\u2019t make sense for us to continue to hold on to those type deposits and we will continue to let those roll off. David Turner : And if you look at, I mean, over the last several quarters we really strengthen the composition of our deposit base and we think it\u2019s more of the core strength of the company and we have rationalized some of our higher cost deposit that whether it be collateralized deposits or public funds deposits. And under these liquidity rules, we want to make sure that we\u2019re building high quality deposit base that we can depend on quarter in and quarter out and so we feel very good about the deposit base we have built obviously in this environment. We have been able to really make that composition ship very gracefully and feel good about where we are at today on deposits. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. And just one more, on the back to Steve\u2019s question around the shared national credit. Thanks for giving us the number. What portion of that portfolio of $19 billion an outstandings, are you the leader ranger. I know you\u2019ve done a fair amount of repurposing with that exposure. So curious where you stand now in terms of which ones your lead on? Thanks. Grayson Hall : So, John, we would say that we have a lead position right or left and a little over 10% of the opportunities that we\u2019re currently. Well, roughly, we have about 10% of the opportunities that were engaged and we don\u2019t have a number on right. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Good morning, Vivek Vivek Juneja : Good morning. Just want to follow up on that cost savings, just to take back a little bit further. You are expecting $400 million through the end of \u201818. How -- where are you thus far in that number. How much of that $400 have you achieved thus far? David Turner : Yeah. So, Vivek, what we recently changed was, when we added the $100 million, so we had an original $300 million plan. Vivek Juneja : Yeah. David Turner : We added $100 million earlier and said we would find that through 2019. We have now adjusted that extra $100 million and say, we find the majority of that in 2018. So, not much of that component is actually in our current run rate. Vivek Juneja : Okay. David Turner : And we will give you better guide as to what that means in December. Vivek Juneja : So meaning of the remaining $300 million, you are -- what you\u2019re saying is not all of that not most of that is already done, given that you are only one more quarter away from the end of \u201817. Does something less than just one quarter worth that\u2019s still you are expecting to still add, is that a fair interpretation? David Turner : Yeah. That would be fair. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Second thing, insurance, fees have been coming down last three quarters, trying to understand just what your plans are for the business? David Turner : Yeah. So we continue to evaluate the risk-adjusted returns on all of our businesses, we evaluate diversification of our businesses and geographies and as it relates to insurance you\u2019re quite right, industry has had a down on a premium market for some time, that starting to reverse actually recently. And so, but we continue, we are going through our strategic planning process, where we look at all of our businesses as we speak and we will give you again more guidance as to what that looks like for our next three years, we will lay that out in December. Vivek Juneja : And what about acquisitions on that one, haven\u2019t seen you do anything much, is that just lack of opportunities or have you decided to step off that a little. David Turner : Yeah. So we backed off that a little bit, you know that industry very well, the multiples of cash flow became very expensive and it was hard for us to justify the type of investment it was going to take us to get any type of sizable acquisition done. So what you have really seen it later are really smaller acquisitions of producers that we put into that business and but it\u2019s really right this minute cost prohibitive for us to spend the type of cash flow. It\u2019s going to be required to do the deal. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And one last thing, your target for CET1 where -- what are you targeting and by when? David Turner : Yeah. So we\u2026 Vivek Juneja : Just remind us. David Turner : Yeah. So we have laid out a target common equity Tier 1 in the 9% range. We had originally targeted that for the end of 2018. We can\u2019t quite get there by the end of 2018. It will be in 2019 before we get there kind of given where our loan growth and our capital plan are laid out. We will update that as we do our CCAR next April, but we expect that to approach that sometime in 2019. Vivek Juneja : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hi. Hi. How are you? Sorry to beat a dead horse here, just want to understand the mechanics around the cost save. So at the Investor Day you highlighted that $300 million over the next three years which about 35% to 45% of that would be in \u201816 and the remainder would be kind of split between \u201817 and \u201818. That -- so essentially what you\u2019re saying is that still holds with the incremental $100 million or so will be mostly achieved in 2018. Am I understanding that correctly? David Turner : That\u2019s correct, Saul. Saul Martinez : Okay. Okay. Great. Just -- and just the final question, if the 10 years kind of stays where we are at 2.4 even gravitate that, what is that mean for premium then going forward? David Turner : Yeah. So we have kind of got to the point where our premium amortization is really not as important to us in terms of what our ultimate net interest income and margin are, we are sitting here in the mid-30s in terms of amortization, that might drift a bit lower, but not appreciably. So we are looking at maybe it bottoms out in the low 30s to high 40s. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. So not really much of a change. All right. David Turner : Yeah. Saul Martinez : Terrific. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over for any closing remarks. Grayson Hall : No. Thank you. We very much appreciate your time and your interest in Regions and look forward to speaking to you at the end of next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Riley FBR, Inc. Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's quarterly earnings call. My name is Paula, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Paula. Good morning, and welcome to Regions' Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer, will review highlights of our full year financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the details of the fourth quarter. Other members of management are also present and available to answer questions.  A copy of the slide presentation referenced throughout this call as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.  Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call.  I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. We successfully met our profitability targets for the year as we continued to diligently execute our strategic plan. For the full year, we reported solid earnings of $1.2 billion, up 9%, with earnings per share of $1, an increase of 15%, while producing growth in pretax pre-provision income and generating positive operating leverage of approximately 2%. Keep in mind, these results include charges associated with tax reform, which speaks to our core performance in 2017. David will cover these details in a moment.  Looking back over the year, I'm particularly pleased with our unwavering focus on customer service and the recognition we received in that regard. This is what relationship banking is all about, and it is at the core of our needs-based, go-to-market strategy. As a result of our efforts, the American Customer Satisfaction Index recently awarded Regions with a #1 ranking. Our focus on outstanding customer service has led to year-over-year growth in checking accounts, households, credit cards, wealth management relationships, total assets under management and consumer loans, all of which are fundamental to growth and future income generation.  As announced a few weeks ago, we have embarked on a new initiative called Simplify and Grow, which enables us to continue enhancing our ability to serve our customers as we make it easier for them to bank with Regions. The evaluation and discovery phase is well underway, and we expect to begin the execution phase in the first quarter. With respect to our financial performance, full year results continue to benefit from our asset-sensitive balance sheet and strong deposit franchise, which drove a 4% increase in adjusted net interest income and a 19 basis point increase in adjusted net interest margin. Prudent expense management remained a top priority in 2017. On an adjusted basis, total noninterest expenses increased less than 1% over the prior year, in line with expectations, reflecting disciplined expense management along with prudent investments in technology and other revenue-generating opportunities. In addition, we expect that our Simplify and Grow strategy will further enhance our efficiency efforts, which we would share with you later in the year.  In terms of the economic backdrop, we are encouraged by improving conditions as well as customer sentiment, providing momentum as we head into 2018. As an example, loan production began to pick up in the second half of the year. For the full year, new and renewed loan production increased 8%, and total loans and leases grew approximately $600 million on a point-to-point basis in the fourth quarter. In 2017, deliberate risk management decisions regarding certain industries and asset classes within the Corporate Banking segment negatively impacted loan balances. For the most part, these efforts are now complete, and our improved credit metrics illustrate these strategies are paying off. To that end, we experienced broad-based improvements during the quarter, including a reduction in nonperforming loans, the lowest level in over 10 years.  Regarding tax reform, we are encouraged by the legislation passed in December and believe domestic businesses will be better positioned and more competitive in the global marketplace. For Regions, tax reform provided the opportunity to make additional investments that will benefit our associates, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. We announced an increase to our minimum hourly wage, benefiting approximately 25% of our workforce. We made a $40 million contribution to our charitable foundation to support financial education, job training, economic development and affordable housing. We also disclosed our plans to invest more in our company with a significant increase in our capital expenditures budget.  As we enter 2018, there are 4 key areas providing considerable momentum for Regions. First, is our asset sensitivity and funding advantage driven by our low-cost deposit base, which we believe provides significant franchise value and a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. Second is asset quality. As reflected this quarter, we continue to report broad-based improvements in credit. Next, robust capital returns as we continue to move towards our target Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. In 2017, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, representing a $488 million or 42% increase over the prior year.  Finally, we expect additional improvements in efficiency and core performance through our Simplify and Grow initiative. We will provide additional details of the expected financial impacts later this year.  Before I turn it over to David to cover the details of the fourth quarter, I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to our team of associates for their hard work and dedication this past year. And I'm proud of our accomplishments and results. We ended the year with good momentum and look forward to leveraging additional opportunities in 2018. David? David Turner : Thank you, and good morning. Before we get started, let me summarize the impact tax reform had on our fourth quarter results. The company revalued its net deferred tax assets and revised its amortization associated with low-income housing investments, resulting in a combined $52 million charge for income tax expense. The company also reduced income associated with leveraged leases, resulting in a $6 million reduction to net interest income and a 2 basis point decline to net interest margin.  As a result of anticipated future savings, the company also contributed $40 million to its charitable foundation. As it relates to regulatory capital, tax reform also had a negative impact. The revaluation of deferred tax items includes approximately $130 million included in equity as a component of other comprehensive income. Despite our prior election to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital, the full revaluation charge was reflected in net income, as noted above, reducing regulatory capital by approximately 10 basis points. Accounting rule-makers subsequently issued a proposed rule change to correct this issue via a reclassification between accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings.  At this juncture, we expect to reclassify these components and recapture those 10 basis points in the first quarter of 2018. Further impacting 2018, the fully taxable equivalent benefit, provided primarily from tax-advantaged loans, will reset in the first quarter. We estimate the impact to be a reduction to net interest margin of approximately 4 basis points.  Now turning back to the quarter. As Grayson mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which reflect improvements in several areas. Let's start with the balance sheet and look at average loans.  In the fourth quarter, average loan balances totaled $79.5 billion, relatively stable with the prior quarter. Loans ended the year at $79.9 billion, reflecting approximately $600 million in point-to-point growth over the prior quarter. Within consumer, we continued to grow despite the negative impacts associated with our exit of a third-party relationship within the indirect vehicle portfolio.  Average balances in the consumer lending portfolio increased $40 million in the fourth quarter. However, excluding the runoff in the indirect vehicle portfolio, average consumer loans increased $223 million. For 2017, runoff in the third-party portfolio totaled $508 million, and we expect the full year average decline in 2018 to be approximately $700 million. In the quarter, we experienced solid growth in residential mortgage, indirect other consumer and consumer credit card, partially offset by continued declines in home equity lending.  Turning to the business lending portfolio. Average balances totaled $48.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline from the third quarter. However, ending balances increased by approximately $500 million. Commercial and industrial loans grew $672 million on an ending basis, led by growth in specialized lending. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined $94 million, reflecting a slowing pace of decline.  Additionally, investor real estate loans declined $101 million as growth in term mortgage loans was offset by declines in construction loans. As we look to 2018, we expect full year average loans to grow in the low single digits, excluding the third-party indirect vehicle portfolio runoff.  Let's move to deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on valuable low-cost deposits while reducing higher-cost, brokered and collateralized deposits. Total average deposits increased modestly during the quarter as growth in low-cost deposits exceeded strategic reductions within the wealth and other segments.  Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits within the wealth segment, which require collateralization by securities, continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee-income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the other segment decreased due to our strategy to reduce retail brokered sweep deposits. We reported solid consumer deposit and strong seasonal growth in corporate deposits during the quarter, consistent with our relationship banking focus.  Looking forward, we expect 2018 full year average deposits to grow in the low single digits, excluding brokered and wealth institutional service deposits. Let's take a look at the composition of our deposit base. Fourth quarter deposit costs remain unchanged at 17 basis points, and total funding costs remained low at 38 basis points, illustrating the strength of our deposit franchise.  As a reminder, our deposit base is more heavily weighted towards retail customers of approximately 67%, and those customers have been very loyal to Regions as more than 43% of our consumer low-cost deposits have been deposit customers for more than 10 years. Our top market share in core states positions us well for future growth, and we expect continued benefit from lower deposit betas relative to peers. For these reasons, we believe our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value and a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. Now let's take a look at how this impacted our results. Adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis, which excludes the tax-related reduction associated with leveraged leases, was $930 million, representing an increase of $9 million or 1% from the prior quarter. The resulting adjusted net interest margin was 3.39%, an increase of 3 basis points. The increases to adjusted net interest income and net interest margin were driven by higher market interest rates, offset by the full impact of debt issued during the third quarter and lower credit-related interest recoveries experienced in the fourth quarter.  With respect to the first quarter of 2018 and excluding the tax-related fully taxable equivalent adjustment of approximately 4 basis points, we expect adjusted net interest income and net interest margin to increase, reflecting the full benefit of the December rate increase and the expectation for higher short-term rates consistent with current market expectations. Notably, modest growth in net interest income is expected despite two fewer days in the quarter, which reduces net interest income by approximately $10 million but benefits margin by approximately four basis points. For the full year of 2018, we expect adjusted net interest income growth in the 3% to 5% range.  Let's move on to fee revenue. We experienced strong growth in adjusted noninterest income, which increased $36 million or 7%, driven primarily by increases in capital markets, mortgage and card and ATM fees. Capital markets had a record quarter, coming in at $56 million, an increase of $21 million or 60%. The increase was driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory services, loan syndication income and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers.  Excluding M&A revenue, which decreased in 2017, other areas within capital markets experienced growth, increasing 28% compared to the prior year. Although timing can be difficult to project, we do expect capital markets income to be a significant contributor to adjusted noninterest income growth in 2018.  As it relates to mortgage, production decreased seasonally 3%, while income increased $4 million or 13%. The increase was primarily due to MSR and related hedge valuation adjustments recorded in the third quarter, which did not repeat at the same level in the fourth quarter. Card and ATM fees increased $3 million or 3%, attributable to seasonally higher interchange income.  Total consumer fee income is an important and stable component of fee revenue and is expected to continue to contribute to overall growth in 2018. Total Wealth Management income is up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by improvement in equity markets, growth in customers and assets under management.  In addition, the company incurred $10 million of operating lease impairments during the third quarter that did not repeat in the fourth quarter. With respect to 2018, we expect total adjusted noninterest income growth in the 3% to 6% range. So let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, expenses increased $21 million or 2%, attributable primarily to increases in salaries and benefits, outside services and Visa Class B shares expense. Total salaries and benefits increased $13 million or 3%, primarily due to higher production-based incentives and health insurance costs. Outside services increased $7 million or 17%, reflecting additional costs associated with the recent launch of our new Regions Wealth Platform in partnership with SEI Global Services. These cost increases will be offset by reductions in other expense categories, primarily salaries and benefits, in the future. The adjusted efficiency ratio improved 60 basis points to 61.1%, and the company produced solid growth in adjusted pretax pre-provision income, increasing 5% and reflecting its highest level since the third quarter of 2008. For 2018, we expect adjusted operating leverage of 3% to 5%, relatively stable adjusted expenses and an adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 60%. With respect to taxes, clearly, there were a number of moving pieces in the fourth quarter. The reported effective tax rate was 39%. Excluding the $52 million of additional income tax expense related to tax reform, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 30%. Following corporate income tax reform, our 2018 guidance for the effective tax rate is now in the 20% to 22% range.  So let's shift to asset quality. The company reported broad-based asset quality improvement during the quarter. Nonperforming, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans all declined. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $110 million or 14% and represented 0.81% of loans outstanding, marking the lowest level in over 10 years. We also reported a 17% and 13% decline in business services criticized and total troubled debt restructured loans, respectively.  As expected, early and late-stage delinquencies for residential mortgage loans increased within hurricane-impacted markets, and the company's $40 million hurricane-related reserve remains unchanged. Despite increase within residential mortgage, total delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, declined approximately 1%. Net charge-offs totaled $63 million or 31 basis points of average loans, a 17% decrease compared to the third quarter. For the full year, net charge-off represented 38 basis points of average loans, in line with expectations. Improving economic conditions drove broad-based improvements in credit metrics, particularly in risk ratings, along with payoffs and paydowns of criticized loans, resulting in a negative provision expense of $44 million for the quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased 14 basis points to 1.17%. However, the allowance, as a percent of total nonaccrual loans, increased 7 basis points to 144%. For 2018, we expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 50 basis points. And based on recent performance and current market conditions, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. However, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large-dollar commercial credits, fluctuating commodity prices and the impact from hurricane exposures.  Let's move on to capital and liquidity. Similar to last quarter, we repurchased another $500 million or 31.1 million shares of common stock and declared $103 million in dividends to common shareholders. Our resulting capital ratios remained robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 11.7%, and the fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.8%. Finally, our liquidity position remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 83%. And we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter-end.  So regarding 2018 expectations, tax reform changes made it necessary to recalibrate our long-term target for adjusted return on average tangible common equity. Our 2018 adjusted return on average tangible common equity ratio is now expected to be in the 14% to 16% range. Other targets have been discussed and are summarized again on this slide for your reference. So in conclusion, our strong fourth quarter results provide a solid foundation as we head into 2018. We believe our Simplify and Grow initiative, along with other opportunities and competitive advantages, position us well for 2018 and beyond.  With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I will now turn it back over to Dana. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. [Operator Instructions]. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: You mentioned later this year that you would quantify some of the initiatives that you have underway. I guess, first, is there going to be both a revenue and expense component as we think about some of these efforts? Grayson Hall : Yes. I mean, Matt, we've been working for a number of months now on this initiative, and it does have both expense and revenue components. But John Owen, he's with us today, and John is leading that initiative. So I'll ask John to make a few comments. John Owen : Just a little bit of background. Simplify and Grow, as you think about it, is a multiyear strategy for the bank. We kicked off the planning process in the fourth quarter working with McKinsey. We wrapped that planning process up in early January. But let me tell you, we've now moved on to what I call execution phase of the project. There are 3 areas of focus. First is how we make banking easier for our customers. Second would be how we accelerate revenue growth. And third would be about improving efficiency and effectiveness. The timing standpoint, I will tell you many of the initiatives will go in, in the second, third quarter. Some will span into 2019 as well. But it's very early. We've got about 10 work streams kicked off very early in the process still. Grayson Hall : And David, from a -- how we'll respond to this publicly, if you could speak to that for a moment. David Turner : Sure, Matt. So this Simplify and Grow, as you heard from John Owen, there's a number of initiatives and how they'll affect our financial statements both from a revenue and an expense standpoint. We have elements that we've given you, our guidance for the year thus far, and we'll be going to a number of conferences. And as we get clarity on exactly what this will do and how it will impact our numbers and ratios, we'll update you. I suspect it will be first, second quarter -- end of the first, maybe second quarter, before we give you any specificity of what that would look like. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Regarding the investment program, I know you're going to give us a little bit more details later on. But in general, how are you thinking about the ultimate tax reform benefit? And how much of that gets deployed into the program? And accordingly, how much eventually falls to the bottom line? David Turner : Yes, John. So this is David. We wanted to give you some flavor for that. If you look at our expectation for return on tangible common equity, we've moved that up 200 basis points from 12 to 14 to 14 to 16. We anticipated some tax reform coming. We believed it was appropriate at the time to increase our capital expenditures to accelerate some opportunities we think we have to better serve our customer. Those capital expenditures, they don't find their way into the income statement. They'll find themselves in the income statement over time. So we have that baked into our guidance already. And we had other initiatives where we've made contributions to our foundation and our $15 for minimum wage because we think it was important for us to continue to execute on our mission of shared value, which is taking care of customers and associates and communities as well as our shareholders. John Pancari : Okay. So no percentage, reinvestment amount that you're willing to give? David Turner : No, we increased our capital expenditures roughly $100 million. Right now, you can see that we're keeping our targets for common equity Tier 1 where they are. Therefore, the benefit that we see coming through from taxes will help increase our return on tangible common net 200 basis points. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. I was just getting at if there's anything else beyond the CapEx amount. Okay. And then separately, in terms of capital deployment. I just want to hop to that. I wanted to get your updated thoughts around interest in M&A as you're looking at opportunities here. How does -- can you remind us of your deployment priorities? How you're thinking about that right now? And where does M&A come into play both non-bank and bank? David Turner : Yes. So our priorities really haven't changed, John. We focus first and foremost on organic growth. It's important for us to take the capital we generate and put it back into the growth in the business appropriately. When we have opportunities to get an appropriate risk-adjusted return from that organic growth, we've been very disciplined with regards to not just making any loan, but making loans that give our shareholders their appropriate risk-adjusted return. We will continue doing that. Second, we wanted to make sure we have a fair dividend to our shareholders. We had talked about being in the range of earnings of 30% to 40% and that we would be increasing that to 35% to 45% over time. We believe that's important. So as income increases, whether it be through tax savings or otherwise, you should expect that to find its way into that dividend calculation. Then we said we would look at opportunities to expand through non-bank acquisitions. We've had a number of [indiscernible]. BlackArch Partners are in the advisory business; First Sterling, our low-income housing tax credit syndicator business, which was basically on ice this year, but we're looking forward to that expansion this year with tax reform. So that's been important. Bank M&A, given the fact that we have excess capital, we really have to look at banks versus share buybacks. And we believe that the share buyback program that we've had going on will continue and that we will continue to work our capital ratios down to that common equity Tier 1 level of roughly 9.5%. As credit quality and derisking continues, perhaps, that number changes. Perhaps, it could even go lower. If we tag on more risk, the number will go higher. But right now, our goal is to get that to 9.5%. Grayson Hall : And John, I think that's a great question. And we look at how our income statement is generating more capital, how do we deploy that capital most constructively and most productively? And as David said, first and foremost, it's organic. It's making sure that we can -- if we can put that capital back into our business constructively and productively, we'll do that. If we can't do that, obviously, we look at M&A. And our primary focus has been bolt-on, non-bank M&A. We continue to look at that. Secondarily, we look at bank M&A, but that -- we've had -- the economics of that make it particularly challenging at this point in time. We look at it, but our primary focus after we've gotten through the organic is -- and the bolt-on acquisitions is really to look at how do we give it back in the form of dividend and share repurchases. We want a competitive dividend, and we want share repurchases as a lever to use when we can't deploy that capital any other way. And we still -- knowing what we know today, we still think that's going to be a productive and constructive use of the capital we're generating. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Just a question on the balance sheet. Thinking through the organic growth in loans and deposits and then the lingering runoff that you articulated clearly, how do we just think about the trajectory of the balance sheet? The balance sheet is clearly becoming more efficient, but do you expect -- I guess, when -- should we see any average earning asset expansion this year? Or is it just kind of netting those -- a final kind of mix to a better place? David Turner : Yes. So we've given you some guidance on low single digits on the balance sheet for loans and deposits. We see that continuing. We have not changed that guidance post tax reform. We'll see what demand for credit might look like. But right now, we feel pretty confident we can grow in the low single digits on both of those. We do have the headwind of our indirect auto book that will affect us about $700 million, as I previously mentioned. But we can overcome that. We continue to grow and grow the balance sheet both in dollars, but also as you mentioned it, it's far more effective and efficient in generating better returns for us. Grayson Hall : Yes, I mean, I think -- yes, we're very pleased with sort of the progress we've made on reshifting the balance of our balance sheet and the assets we've invested in. Clearly, in 2016, 2017, we made some risk-based decisions regarding our balance sheet and reduced our risk appetite for certain asset classes, which created a headwind for us in terms of loan growth. We had very good loan production growth in 2017. That production actually strengthened in the second half of the year. We felt good about that. What we have not built into the guidance is any sort of optimism about loan growth above and beyond what we're seeing today, is if business is more certain and more confident in 2018 than they have been thus far, that's an upside opportunity. But for right now, we've built in what we know and what we see. Obviously, we'd be encouraged if it's better than that. But John Turner is with us. John, do you mind making a few comments about the potential for loan growth? John Turner : Sure, Grayson. I'm happy to. As has been currently suggested, we're currently projecting sort of low single-digit loan growth. That is based upon our assessment of economic conditions, market conditions prior to, as has been said, any tax reform. I would say that we are largely complete with the derisking activities. We'll continue to focus on improving the quality of our portfolio and client selectivity on risk-adjusted returns in the business. And so I anticipate that we will see, just as a result of better execution, continued improvement in execution for that low single-digit growth. And if the economy does, in fact, tick up as a result of tax reform, then we should benefit from that. But in the meantime, we do believe we can deliver low single-digit growth just based upon our day-to-day activities and expectations for the business. Kenneth Usdin : Great. Understood. And then inside that efficiency comment, can you -- is there a way you can help us separate how much of that efficiency can help the NIM itself on its own versus how much rates can help the NIM, presuming the curve and the hikes that you're expecting? David Turner : I'm not exactly sure of your question, but let me see if I can give it a stab. So our efficiency ratio, we have a number of things we're going to have to deal with. The tax equivalent adjustment that we have does negatively impact the efficiency ratio as it does the margins. So I told you the 4 basis points in the margin. But it also negatively impact the efficiency ratio about 50 basis points. Q - Kenneth Usdin : 50 bps, right? David Turner : 50 bps. But we're still committed to having an efficiency ratio under that 60% that we mentioned. So that will come from continuing to become more efficient on expenses. We did a good job of having it less than 1% growth in expenses this year. We see renewed growth in revenue coming. We gave you the guidance of 3% to 5% on NII. We feel good about that based on balance sheet growth and even more encouraged based on what we've seen of late with the market expectations for rates. And we also are getting back on the growth side of noninterest revenue, where we were down this year, but expect 3% to 6% growth in noninterest revenue. So if you put all that together, and we'll get some incremental benefits from the Simplify and Grow strategy that we talked about, we feel pretty confident we can be under 60%. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : I guess, if I look back at the 3Q presentation, you talked about additional expense reductions beyond the $400 million. Details to be provided later in the year. And we're on the 4Q call in January, and it sounds like you've announced Simplify and Grow as a main project. But in terms of getting real financial details behind that, we're going to have to wait later into 2018. Has something changed that means you're taking a deeper look or you're thinking about things in a different way than you were back in October when you put out that 3Q presentation? Grayson Hall : No, Geoffrey. There's really been no change in our perspective as we talked about this in the third quarter, as you mentioned in your comments. We've been on a multiyear journey of really trying to manage expenses very rigorously and with a lot of discipline. And we absolutely are confident we've done a good job of that. That being said, what we announced in the third quarter is it -- we were going to bring McKinsey in to help us take an even harder look at that. And we embarked on those work streams, as John Owen spoke about a moment ago. It's been a very in-depth evaluation. It's -- we've had people across the company involved in it. And these things are best done very thoughtfully and very carefully. And we've taken our time to do that. And we're in the middle of execution at that point -- at this point in time, and there's details forthcoming. But nothing's changed from our perspective. Everything is on schedule, just as we had forecasted it would be. Geoffrey Elliott : And I guess, the long-term ROTCE target, it sounds like that's 14% to 16% long term, but also 2018 target, if I'm reading Slide 13 right. So is this going to take another look at that based on Simplify and Grow? David Turner : Yes. So that 14% to 16% target was a 2018 target. It was not necessarily a longer-term target. We do expect, as I mentioned before, when we were in the 12% to 14% range, that we would continue to move up -- expectations that we'd move up towards the mid-teens on return on tangible common. Since then, we've had tax reform. We've also had Simplify and Grow. So we will give you better guidance over that range of 14% to 16% as that becomes known. We will be doing another Investor Day roughly this time next year. We'll give you a new three-year set of targets. We'll show you how we compare to the original set of targets that we gave you. But no, we expect that to continue to grow past 2018's results. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Jennifer Demba : Could you just talk about what you think the main drivers of your forecasted fee income growth will be this year? David Turner : Sure. So as you look at the detail of our noninterest revenue, we got out of the box a little slower in terms of our capital markets business. It recovered quite nicely in the fourth quarter. And as we said in our prepared comments, we expect that capital markets in particular to be helpful to our 3% to 6% growth in 2018. We do have -- our service charges have been a very stable component of our noninterest revenue. We grew that about a little over 2%, almost 3% in the year. We expect that to contribute as we continue to grow core checking account households. Card and ATM fees, we'll continue to grow those both in terms of share numbers. Our transactions are up, so that will be a piece of it. Our Wealth Management Group in particular in the investment management trust area has continued to benefit from growth in customers as well as assets under management, so that will be a piece of it. We think mortgage continue -- will rebound. We think mortgage will be up nicely from the production that we had this year. It was kind of a reset, we believe, for the industry. So you should see mortgage continuing to rebound as well. Those are kind of the bigger items that we have that should contribute to that 3% to 6% growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR. Stephen Moss : Circling back to loan growth, just wondering how we should think about it. Strength throughout the year or perhaps back-end-weighted? And then what do you think will be the primary drivers of growth? C&I and commercial real estate or consumer? Grayson Hall : Well, I think when you look at 2018 and you think through when long demand occurs, I would tell you there's still an awful lot of liquidity in the markets. And if you look at '17 as an example, we've started off with the year in pretty good shape from a production pipeline standpoint. In the second half of the year, we wound up having an awful lot of payoffs and paydowns as people went into the public debt markets. We saw the strength of that stronger in the third than in the fourth, but still elevated. And so I do think that there's still a lot of liquidity that's out there, and so there's competition for that. Internally, we've had debates about the implications of tax reform and what that has on loan demand. We don't see that changing really what's occurring on the consumer side of the house. Consumer is a good story, and it's a steady story. Other than the headwinds that we have from the indirect auto runoff portfolio we've got, it's a good story. Even in mortgage, '17 turned out to be a very transformational year for mortgage as that market went from a refinance market to a home purchase market. But we've always been a strong home purchase mortgage originator, and so most of the impact of that will be past us in '17 on the consumer side. The only lingering effect we got on consumer is just the indirect auto piece. On the commercial side, we put together our forecast based on what we know today. If the economy strengthens, as John Turner said earlier, if the economy strengthens, we got an upside opportunity. But knowing what we know today, we think the forecast that we've given you, the guidance we've given you, we got a fairly high degree of confidence in it. John Turner, would you like to add to that? John Turner : Yes, I would just add. Typically, the second and fourth quarters are going to be better quarters. We begin the year with a lot of momentum coming off of a high degree of production in the fourth quarter. So pipelines are a little softer going into the year, but funding should be a little better in the first quarter given that activity in the fourth. We have confidence in our ability to deliver commercial banking and commercial lending activity this year. I think the difference is going to be that we have been shrinking, derisking our investor real estate book. And we have an opportunity to grow that business kind of with the economy, particularly as we see our term lending program begin to mature a bit as we shift our focus on a different kind of real estate customer. We're beginning to see some of that positive activity. So that will have an impact on loan growth as well in 2018. Stephen Moss : Okay. And then on asset quality this quarter, nice improvement in the numbers. Wondering how much of that paydowns versus risk-weighted improvements. And how should we think about the loan loss reserve going forward? Barbara Godin : Yes. This is Barb. And to answer your question directly, roughly 50% of what we saw in terms of the improvement of our business services classified loan book was payoffs or paydowns. The balance was risk weighted improvements. And it is broad-based. It wasn't just specific to just the energy sector. We certainly saw some improvement in energy, but we saw it right across the board in all the various asset classes. As it relates to the allowance, going to 1 17, again we follow a very formulaic way of doing our allowance. And you've heard me say in the past, we're not going to let it fall substantially. But at the same time, we do have to ensure that we have the right amount of allowance against the right amount of risk. So I don't have a specific number for your that we either target or aim for. We just make sure that the allowance we do have is appropriate and prudent at all times. David Turner : I would add that we gave you some guidance on the charge-offs being in the range of 35 to 50 basis points. And based on what we know today, we think we have charge-offs closer to the lower end of that. And you should think about provisioning equal to charge-offs in that case. To the extent it's higher than that, you probably have something that happened in a hurricane or an energy-type reserve, where the reserve is already there. It doesn't have to be replaced. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Steven Duong : This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just circling back on your comments about capital expenditures. You said you're looking to increase CapEx, which should help you boost your ROTCE target. What are these investments exactly? And is it safe to assume that they're capitalized so they won't show in the P&L? David Turner : Yes. So a couple of things. The CapEx, roughly $100 million, is over what we had in 2017. Those capital expenditures are really in areas that help -- make it easier for our customers to do business with us, that help us generate revenue. We don't tie that necessarily to return, at least directly. We believe there are a lot of opportunities. These capital expenditures are exactly that. They hit the balance sheet. They'll be depreciated over time. And depending on the nature of the project, they could be long-dated. They could be tied to a branch. It may be tied to digital opportunities. It may be tied to cyber-risk efforts. So those -- that number, or that increase, you should think about, again, hitting the balance sheet but not hitting the income statement, but a little bit each year. And that's after it's spent. It will this year that we spend it. So you will see hardly any of that hit income this year. Grayson Hall : And Steven, you're seeing a lot of our customers really start to have a high utilization rate in our digital channels. And so obviously, those customers' expectations are being influenced not only by other banks they use but other providers for other services. And so we're having to compare ourselves to a larger community when you talk about digital, and so we make investments there. We also have a number of technologies that we use to help us manage risk and compliance. And so we have to continue to invest in those, continue to strengthen. And we make them better each and every year, and cyber being one of the lead candidates there. But lastly, I would tell you is, coming out of this Simplify and Grow initiative, we've identified a lot of places where technology can help us be not only more effective, but much more efficient. And so you're going to see us continue to invest in technology as we go through that initiative. And last but certainly not least is see if you go into some of our branches, the technology we're deploying in our new branch format is entirely different than what we've had in the past. We've done a number of branches in the past in '16 and '17, but you'll see us accelerate that into '18. A huge benefit from us from a customer service perspective and a customer experience perspective when they come into one of our offices. Steven Duong : Great. And just a follow-up question. You guys are trading at about 1.3x book, 2x tangible book. Is there a price level where the buybacks don't make as much sense relative to the other opportunities that you have? David Turner : We continue to challenge ourselves on that very point, but we're sitting here with a pretty high Common Equity Tier 1 ratio relative to the risk that we have in the balance sheet. And so when you have excess capital, it's hard to see how the market gives you full credit for being optimized on your capital stack. And so we have to have a pretty high return hurdle for us to deviate from buying back our shares versus making some other type of investments. So when you get to the efficient frontier, having your capital amount and your capital stack optimized, then you got a different calculus. But for us, getting to that 9.5% is very important to us, and that's where we're marching. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : You may have mentioned this earlier. I just missed it. Does any relief in the LCR rule get baked into your outlook for this year? Or could you describe sort of how that would benefit if it plays out in your favor? David Turner : Yes, Chris. It's David. We do not have any relief in our -- in the numbers we just told you from LCR, to the extent that the SIFI designation was changed, and therefore, we weren't subject to LCR. There are some deposits that were fairly low-cost deposits for us that, based on the rules, the runoff assumptions caused us to price those where they weren't as favorable to us, and we let those run off. So yes, LCR certainly would be somewhat beneficial to us. It would help us more from a liquidity standpoint, where we could generate more liquidity there. But in terms of an explicit cost, we haven't quantified that at this point. Christopher Marinac : Okay. Great. Could it also help fuel further buybacks as well? David Turner : Not really. You're really talking about a different -- you're talking about liquidity in the bank versus liquidity at the holding company. Those are different concepts, and our -- whatever liquidity we need in the holding company to get our buybacks executed, to help us get to our target capital ratios, we'll fund by debt issuances, like we've done before. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Hall for any closing remarks. Grayson Hall : Okay. Well, thank you. I certainly appreciate everybody's time and attendance. We think we just ended a very solid 2017 and are positioned well for a strong 2018. And I do appreciate you listening to our message this morning and our answers to your questions. So thank you. Let's have a great year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer, will review highlights of our first quarter financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the details of the quarter. Other members of management are also present and available to answer questions. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earning supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call. With that, I will now turn the call over to Grayson. Grayson Hall : Thanks, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying we're pleased with our first quarter 2018 results, which represent a good start to the year. For the first quarter, we reported solid earnings from continuing operations of $398 million, up 44%, and earnings per share of $0.35, an increase of 52% compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage with solid revenue growth and disciplined expense management, and this marks another strong quarter of respect asset quality. We continue to benefit from our asset-sensitive balance sheet and strong deposit franchise, which drove a 6% year-over-year increase in net interest income and a 21 basis point increase in net interest margin. Total new and renewed loan production increased 24% over the prior year, resulting in a modest adjusted average loan growth during the first quarter. In terms of the economy, we remain encouraged by improving conditions, as well as customer sentiment. The consumer generally remains healthy, and we continue to experience growth in our consumer loan portfolios, as well as consumer deposits. During the quarter, we continue to experience broad-based improvement in most credit metrics, including further reduction in nonperforming loans, which marks the best metric in over a decade. With respect to our business strategy, we remain committed to diligent execution of our strategic plan, and we're making notable progress with respect to our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative. As part of that effort, in March, we announced steps to streamline our structure, creating more distinct lines of responsibility and much clearer accountability. These changes simplify our organization, strengthen our connection with our customers, increase engagement with our communities and create greater alignment with our business and our strategies. In addition, through reinforcing our commitment to our communities, we believe these changes will further improve service quality and make banking easier for our customers. Related, two weeks ago we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Regions Insurance Group subsidiary. This transaction further supports our efforts to simplify and streamline our company and focus on businesses where we can add the most value. It also demonstrates our strategic planning and capital allocation process in action and aligns with our Simplify and Grow initiative. In addition, we continue to evaluate our retail network strategy and recently approved plans to consolidate between 30 and 40 additional branches during 2018. To facilitate growth, we\u2019ve also plan to open approximately 20 de novo branches in certain high-growth priority markets. Rest assured, during this time of transformational change for our company, we remain focused as ever on providing customers with exemplary service. This is what relationship banking is all about, and it's at the core of our needs-based, go-to-market strategy. Validating our approach, we recently received recognitions from several external sources for our superior customer service. For the fifth consecutive year, Regions was ranked among the top 10% of companies across a wide range of industries in the Timken Experience Rankings. And for the fourth consecutive year, Regions has received the Gallup Great Workplace Award for employee engagement. Regions was also recognized by Greenwich Associates with 22 excellence awards for small business and middle market customer service, and Regions ranked second highest in customer satisfaction for advance guidance in the J.D. Power Retail Banking Sales Practices and Advice Study. Again, these awards provide evidence that our needs based, go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with customers and associates. As we look forward, we believe there are four key areas providing considerable momentum for Regions. First is our asset sensitivity and funding advantage driven by our low-cost deposit base, which we believe provides a significant franchise value and a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. Second relates to asset quality. We experienced another quarter of broad-based improvements in credit quality and continue to expect modest improvements throughout the remainder of the year. Next, robust capital returns as we move towards our target Common Equity Tier 1 ratio included the anticipated capital generated from the sale of our Regions Insurance subsidiary. Finally, we expect additional improvements in core performance through our Simplify and Grow initiative, which is well underway as evidenced by our actions during the quarter. I will now turn the call over to David to cover the details of the first quarter. David? David Turner : Thank you, and good morning. As Grayson mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect improvement in several areas and solid momentum as we head into the remainder of 2018. Before we get started, it's important to point out that the decision to sell our Insurance business meets the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations at March 31st. My comments this morning will be limited to results from continuing operations, and our earning supplements provides recast historical results that exclude insurance. Now let's start with the balance sheet, beginning with average loans. Adjusted average loan balances increased $620 million or 1% over the prior quarter. Adjusted loans exclude the third party indirect vehicle portfolio, as well as the impact of a $254 million sale of residential mortgage loans that occurred during the first quarter. This sale consisted primarily of Troubled Debt Restructured or TDR loans, which are punitive for purposes of the FDIC assessment and include elevated loss assumptions under adverse capital planning scenarios. This, coupled with an improving market for re-performing TDR loans, provided an opportunity to further derisk our balance sheet. Within consumer, we continue to generate consistent loan growth across most categories. Adjusted average balances in the consumer lending portfolio totaled $30.1 billion, reflecting an increase of $157 million. Growth in residential mortgage, indirect other consumer, indirect vehicle and consumer credit card was partially offset by continued declines in home equity balances. Turning to the business lending portfolio. Average balances totaled $48.6 billion, reflecting an increase of $463 million as growth in C&I loans was partially offset by declines in owner-occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate. C&I loans grew $775 million, led by growth in government and institutional banking, energy and natural resources and technology and defense. And related pipelines continued to improve. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined $108 million, reflecting a slowing pace of decline. Additionally, investor real estate loans declined $204 million, driven by maturities and payoffs. However, we believe this portfolio will begin to stabilize and grow in the second half of the year. For the balance of 2018, we continue to expect full year adjusted average loans to grow in the low single digits. Let's move on to deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on valuable low cost consumer deposits, while reducing certain higher cost, brokered and collateralized deposits. Total average deposits declined approximately 2% during the quarter to $95.4 billion. Consumer segment deposits experienced modest growth during the quarter, consistent with our relationship banking focus, while corporate segment deposits decreased 2%, driven primarily by seasonal declines. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $221 million or 2%, driven primarily by a decline in interest-free deposits, as well as ongoing strategic reduction of collateralized deposits. Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits within the wealth segment, which requires collateralization by securities, continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the other segment decreased $946 million or 36%, driven by our strategy to reduce retail brokered suite deposits. Looking forward, we continue to expect 2018 full year average deposits to grow in the low single digits, excluding brokered and wealth institutional services deposits. Let's take a look at the composition of our deposit base. During the first quarter, deposit cost increased 4 basis points to 21 basis points, largely driven by indexed accounts and annual savings account bonuses. Total funding cost remained low at 46 basis points, illustrating the strength of our deposit franchise. Further illustrating this strength, cumulative deposit betas through the current rising rate cycle are only 13%. And importantly, consumer retail deposit betas remained near zero. As expected, commercial deposit betas have been more reactive with a cumulative beta of approximately 39%. As a reminder, over 2/3rds of our deposit base is from retail customers, and those customers have been very loyal to Regions, as more than 45% of our consumer low-cost deposits are from individuals who have been deposit customers for more than 10 years. We are well positioned to maintain a lower deposit beta relative to peers given our large deposit franchise, customer loyalty, market locations, small account balances and our strong liquidity position. We are also committed to paying our customers competitive and appropriate rates on their deposits. Let's take a look at how this impacted our results. On an adjusted basis, net interest income was $909 million, representing an increase of $2 million from the prior quarter, and net interest margin was 3.46%, an increase of 7 basis points. These increases were driven by higher market interest rates, marginally offset by the incremental cost of our opportunistic bank debt issuance earlier in the quarter. In addition, two fewer days in the quarter reduced net interest income by approximately $10 million, but benefited net interest margin by approximately 4 basis points. As a reminder, offsetting the net interest margin benefit from day count is a permanent reset downward of approximately 4 basis points associated with the reduced taxable equivalent adjustment resulting from tax reform. With respect to full year 2018, due to higher interest rate expectations relative to our original forecast assumptions, we now expect adjusted net interest income growth in the 4% to 6% range. Specific to the second quarter of 2018, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to increase, reflecting the full benefit of the March rate increase and current expectations for higher short term rates. Keep in mind, one additional day in the second quarter will benefit net interest income approximately $5 million, but reduce net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. We expect continued growth in net interest income consistent with our improved full year outlook, and we expect net interest margin to be stable to up modestly. Let's move on to fee revenue. Adjusted non-interest income totaled $503 million, reflecting a decrease of $3 million or 1% from the fourth quarter. Other non-interest income includes a $6 million increase to the value of an equity investment and $7 million in net gains associated with the sale of certain low income housing investments. Offsetting these gains were $4 million of net impairment charges related to certain operating lease assets. Capital markets experienced another strong quarter. However, income declined from a record high fourth quarter. Although timing can be difficult to project, we do expect capital markets income to be a significant contributor to adjusted non-interest income growth in 2018. Card and ATM fees were seasonally lower, reflecting lower interchange income. An increase in mortgage income was driven by improvement in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Consumer fee income categories are an important and stable component of fee revenue and are also expected to contribute to overall growth in 2018. With respect to full year 2018, we continue to expect adjusted non-interest income growth in the 3% to 6% range. Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense decreased $7 million or 1% attributable primarily to decreases in expense associated with Visa Class B shares and FDIC assessments, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits and professional fees. Recent unsecured debt issuances and the residential mortgage loan sale, consisting primarily of troubled debt restructured loans, contributed to a reduction in the FDIC assessment. Excluding the impact of severance charges, salaries and benefits increase nominally due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes, partially offset by staffing reductions. Efforts to simplify our organizational structure, including previously discussed structural changes, contributed to approximately 350 fewer positions since year-end and 735 fewer positions since the first quarter of the prior year. These efforts contributed to increased severance charges this quarter. We do expect to incur additional severance charges throughout the remainder of 2018 as we execute on our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative. The increase in professional fees is primarily attributable to higher consulting fees. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.5%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. Of note, the company also generated 2.3% adjusted positive operating leverage over the first quarter of 2017. We experienced solid growth in adjusted pretax pre-provisioned income, increasing 11% and reflecting its highest level in almost 10 years. For full year 2018, we expect adjusted operating leverage of 3% to 5%, relatively stable adjusted expenses and an adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 60%. The first quarter effective tax rate was 23.6%. However, we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%. Shifting to asset quality. Broad-based asset quality improvement continue during the quarter. Non-performing, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans, as well as total delinquencies all declined. Marking the lowest level in over a decade, non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $49 million or 8% and now represent 0.75% of loans outstanding. We also reported a 9% and 13% decline in business services criticized and total troubled debt restructured loans, respectively, and a 4% decline in total delinquencies. Adjusted net charge-offs totaled $79 million or 40 basis points of average loans, a 9 basis point increase over the prior quarter. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily attributable to larger recoveries in the prior quarter. As it relates to the allowance for loan losses, a $30 million reduction of hurricane specific allowance and a $21 million reduction associated with the TDR sale, combined with payoffs and paydowns of adversely rated loans, resulted in a credit provision of $10 million. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased 12 basis points to 1.05% of total loans outstanding. The resulting allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of total non-accrual loans decreased 4 basis points to 140%. For the full year of 2018, we expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 50 basis points, and based on recent performance and current market conditions, we would expect to be at lower end of that range. However, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large dollar commercial credits. So let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the first quarter, we repurchased $235 million or 12.5 million shares of common stock and declared $101 million in dividends to common shareholders. As Grayson mentioned, following quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our insurance subsidiary. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to generate additional capital of approximately $300 million at closing, which is expected to be in the third quarter. The capital generated is expected to be used to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to review and non-objection by the Federal Reserve, as part of the 2018 CCAR process. Our first quarter capital ratios remained robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 11.9%, and the fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.0%. Finally, our liquidity position remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%, and we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter end. Regarding 2018 expectations. With exception of an increase in adjusted net interest income growth, our expectations remain unchanged and are summarized again on this slide for your reference. So in conclusion, our first quarter results provide a solid start to the year, and we believe our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative, along with other opportunities and competitive advantages position us well for 2018 and beyond. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I will now turn it back over to Dana. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. [Operator Instructions] We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. John Pancari : Good morning. On the McKinsey study, just wanted to see if you can update us with your - any expectations you've developed out of that in terms of a targeted efficiency. And how much of that - of any target that comes out of that, would you expect would be revenue versus expenses? Thanks. David Turner : Yes, John. This is David. So we've - we had elements of McKinsey built into the guidance that we've given you for 2018. We're still working through - we just kind of got the first part of this done in the first quarter. There's a lot more to do. And we're going to update you on kind of a three year, this is going to be a longer journey. This is not a 2018 only. We'll have elements of this working through a couple of years, 2 to 3 years, actually. We're going to update all that at our Investor Day, which will happen in February of '19. With that being said, there's elements of McKinsey of how we keep our expense number relatively flat this year, and there's elements of McKinsey on how we get the growth in revenue of 3% to 6% on NIR for 2018 as well. As we think about the total commitment on revenue, it's about 70% of it is expense and about 30% of it is on the revenue side. That's our best guess, thus far. We will refine those as we go through the remainder of our Simplify and Grow initiative. Grayson Hall : Efficiency ratio. David Turner : From an efficiency ratio standpoint, we've given your guidance. It will be below 60%. As you know, we had - when the tax rate change that cost all of us, all of our peers, for the tax adjustment for us it's about 50 basis points going the other way. We did not change our guidance because we had Simplify and Grow, and we also had our insurance transaction in mind at the time. So we think we're confident we'll have an efficiency ratio below 60% in '18. And that being said, we think, over time we're going to need to be in that mid-50s, and we're working towards that. John Pancari : Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, on the capital side. You mentioned the insurance sale. And along those lines, can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about the business mix? If there's other areas of the business that you think you would possibly exit. And then conversely, how are you thinking about additions to the business in terms of whole bank M&A, and maybe a thought on the environment? Thanks. Grayson Hall : John, first of all, the Regions Insurance has been a part of our business for a while. It's a very - we made a very analytical, thoughtful evaluation to that. It was a valuable asset for us, a very talented team in the Regions Insurance Group. But we had reached a point in our analysis where we had to make a decision on how best to deploy our capital and should we try to increase the scale of our participation in that segment, or where there - was there a more valuable asset for someone else. And as you see, we came through what was a complex but thoughtful decision. It took what was a viable asset to us, and we think we made a good decision for ourselves, for our customers and for our team members that are in that business. When we look at opportunities to grow, as we've said in the past, we're primarily focused on organic growth, trying to determine how to do that. We, on a very ongoing disciplined basis, look at how we're allocating our capital by product, by business, by geography. And we look for opportunities to acquire where it will help accelerate growth. We've been fairly active in non-bank acquisitions. We continue to review those opportunities. We've been very studious on bank acquisitions but continue to look at the markets and how we trade versus banks that we might be interested in and still economically challenging. So while we're looking at it, we're studying it. We understand where the markets are at. We just think the opportunity for bank M&A for us is fairly limited at the moment. And so we're trying to prioritize how we grow. And again, I think organic is the first way we grow, and non-bank acquisition is the second way we grow at this moment. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe I'll ask John's question a little different way. Was there a full business review done in making the decision to selling the insurance business. I know you're currently looking at other businesses to potentially sell that. You're either subscale or you're not achieving your desired returns? Grayson Hall : I mean, Ryan, absolutely. I mean, we take a full business review of all of our businesses on a fairly frequent basis. But we - David has probably mentioned hundreds of times in terms of optimizing our allocation of capital, and we really spend a lot of time not only in our finance team, but also in our business leadership teams, determining exactly what a reasonable rate of return is for those businesses. We set different hurdles for them. As you might imagine, we debate them back and forth because those profit pools expand and contract depending on where you're at in the cycle. And so we look at - we try to look at these businesses on a long-term sustainable basis, not just a particular point in time. As you might imagine, our decision to divest Regions Insurance was a difficult decision because we've been in that business for a long time, and then like I said, a great team of people running it. But when we look at the risk-adjusted returns in that business and what we had to do to improve those, we came to the conclusion, given where those assets are trading today, that the best decision for us was to divest that business. We look at all our businesses that way. And not that we intend to share our debates, but you can rest assure that there's a rigorous debate going on all the time regarding businesses that we're in. David, you want to add to that? David Turner : Yes. I would say that there are a lot of factors that we look at, as Grayson mentioned, in evaluating a business. We look at how synergistic businesses are or not. In this particular case, Insurance, we had more of a retail platform than BB&T did. BB&T has a wholesale platform that they can marry up with retail. They had more scale in the business than we did. And for us, to get to scale, we thought we needed to have to become more efficient at it. As you can see now, the efficiency ratio is pretty high for us in the business. And to get the scale and the efficiency ratio, then it was going to require a disproportionate amount of capital investment that we felt we can use elsewhere. And it's a good thing -- it's a good business, good people. As a matter of fact, we use them as well, and we think that BB&T can do more than we can, and we have -- we'll put our capital to use in a more appropriate fashion. Grayson Hall : And we do think it is a good transaction for us and likewise think it was a good transaction for BB&T. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for all the color. And I guess, David, you noted in the slides that consumer betas are near zero, commercial is running just below 40. Can you maybe just give us a sense what's baked into your 4% to 6% NII growth for the rest of the year? And have you had to make any changes on the consumer side with the most recent hikes? Thanks for taking my question. David Turner : Yes. So you're right. That consumer beta has been low to nonexistent. We do think we'll get pressure over time. We aren't seeing it on the consumer side yet, but we expect that to happen. And we have a beta still baked in that 35% range, going up to 60% over time. The commercial side, a lot of that's indexed to the funds rate or other rates in Wealth Management. And we've been fairly conservative with our betas. They've proven out better than we thought. We're at 13% cumulative beta, and we think for the next -- maybe the next one or two moves, maybe we keep it low. But over time, it's going to catch up to where we think it's going to be in that 40% to 60% range. As you think about Q2, we really don't put a beta forecast -- we haven't given you that, but we expect that to be fairly similar to what we just saw this past quarter. Ryan Nash : Thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a little bit of clarity in terms of timing of announcement regarding some of the conclusions from Simplify and Grow. I think the market had been expecting some - an update, a more formal update in the summer. I'm wondering if there still will be a formal update in the summer in addition to during your February '19 Investor Day, or should we wait until the '19 Investor Day to get a more robust update? David Turner : Yes, Erika, we - what we want to do is make sure we have a very solid footing on our Simplify and Grow, the effects of that on our business before we go to the market with it. I think what we've leaned over time since our Investor Day is credibility. We're doing what we said we're going to do. We want to make sure we're ready and have the right commitment. We do know that will happen by Investor Day, so you'll have a lot of clarity at the Investor Day. And to the extent that we get further down the road, we'll give you an update as we determine that. I think we will have probably something incremental. Each quarter, we'll give you something incremental, but the full-fledged, here's what it's going to mean for really '19 and '20 and beyond is at Investor Day. It is -- as you can imagine, putting things in motion today, you're really -- it takes time to receive -- to garner the benefit of those changes, and so we don't see a ton of change on our business in all of '18. You'll see elements of that trickling in the back half of '18, and we'll give you that guidance as it becomes known, and perhaps, we'll give you some incremental in the second quarter. Grayson Hall : But Erika, I would say you're going to hear from us every quarter on things that we're doing that we more broadly place under that umbrella. You clearly heard this quarter on our sale of the troubled debt restructured loans, that broadly falls under the Simplify and Grow umbrella. We also had the Regions Insurance sale. We also, in the prepared remarks, gave you how much our headcount was down quarter-over-quarter, as well as how much it was down year-over-year. You've seen a number of public press releases on our reorganization efforts in terms of how we line up to go to market. And so you're going to hear this every quarter. And this quarter was probably one of the more informative quarters we've had in a while. And you'll see that continue throughout the year. To David's point, we'll continue to give those every quarter, but then you'll see us embed those in our 3 year forecast at Investor Day next February. But it's not like you got to wait for February to hear some of this. But clearly, some of these things we're doing, we can't preannounce prior to actually executing the transactions. Erika Najarian : Got it. So my follow-up then is - the better way to think about it is simplify and Grow is part of your business-as-usual-way- of conducting your day to day. And so as we think about '18 and '19, even though, in the formal announcement, it's not until February, you're still simplifying and -- taking those initiatives that your shareholders can reap benefits in '18 and '19? Grayson Hall : Absolutely. And I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't cast February as a formal announcement of Simplify and Grow. February is a formal announcement of our next 3-year plan, and our Simplify and Grow activity will be embedded in that plan. Erika Najarian : Understood. Very clear. Thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Grayson Hall : Morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Morning. Couple of questions. One is on the 2018 expectations. You indicated a fee growth target. And obviously, you have sold the insurance business. I just wanted to make sure I understood that there's other areas that are going to be picking up and making up for the insurance business sale. Is that accurate? David Turner : Well - so we put Regions Insurance Group in discontinued operations, and we've restated everything. So you've got to go back to the restated baseline as well. So we're talking about 3% to 6% off of that. We're not going to do 3% to 6% off of overcoming the gross revenue of insurance. Betsy Graseck : Right. And so what you're suggesting is that the fee growth rate really was not being impacted by the insurance business? David Turner : That's right. We had 3% -- that's right. We've had 3% to 6% regardless. Betsy Graseck : Great, okay. And then just on some of the investments. You mentioned the de novo branches. Maybe you could give us a sense of size, scale, scope, market, timing? Grayson Hall : I'll ask John Owen to respond to that. John Owen : Good morning. This is John Owen. We were going to roll out probably 20 branches of this year. They'd be concentrated, really, in three markets. St. Louis will be the majority, where eight or nine of our branches will open in St. Louis in the, really, second, third quarter time period. Atlanta would be another market where we're going to open branches on this quarter. And the last would be Houston. So those would be the key markets you'll see the roughly 20 branches open this year. There'll be a few infill markets in Memphis and Knoxville, and Charlotte and Williamsville as well. The other thing on a branching standpoint that were mentioned, consolidation, we've got roughly 30 to 40 consolidations teed up as well. So you'll our net branch count will be down a little bit, but you'll see us continue to invest in key markets. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the trajectory of investment and expense saves, obviously, fits into the efficiency ratio expectations you've got. Do you feel like this type of pace is something to continue into 2019, '20 -- over the next couple of years? Or do you feel like your branch network will be where you want it to be by the end of this year? John Owen : I would tell you, over the next two to three years, you'll see us continue to build roughly 20 to 30 branches a year in select markets. We also have opportunities where we can to continue to consolidate. The opportunities on consolidation are getting a little bit harder, if you will. We've consolidated, in the last two years, about 10% of our network over the last two years. And there's opportunity, and a lot of that opportunity is what I'll call two for ones or thee for ones, where we're taking a branch and expanding a branch to absorb two or thee of the branches that are nearby. So you'll see us balance out building and consolidating. Grayson Hall : But Betsy, it's - our branch rationalization process is part of how we manage channels, in general, whether it's our digital channel, our contact centers, our ATMs, our branches. And it's a fairly dynamic review, and it's been one we've had in place for quite some time. And to John's point, we'll continue to make annual adjustments to that as we see markets change and we see customer behavior change. And so it's a very analytical process. And so we make forecast out three years on that, but we review them constantly. So if we need to make in-flight adjustments, we can do that. John Owen : The only thing I would add is the fact that the reason we've been able to consolidate as many branch as we have is our investments in our online and mobile space. We've had a lot of self-service transactions going online and mobile, and that's allowed, really, us to consolidate and not impact our growth. Betsy Graseck : And just one last one, on video ATMs. When we were down there recently, it was interesting to see how much functionality that has. And I was wondering, is that strategy of video ATMs a kind of fill-in of existing footprint? Or is that more an opportunity to expand footprint? John Owen : Yes, we've got roughly 90 video ATMs deployed. It really is -- we're finding out we're testing it a couple of different way. One, inside our branches, we're using the vestibules to extend banking hours. And to your point, customers can do most of their banking transactions on that video teller. They have an opportunity to talk to experienced banker that can help them with those transactions, and we've seen good adoption in our branches and the vestibules. We've also tried it in a few drive-thru ATMs. I would tell you, those are not quite as high usage because we don't have the ability to assist that customer and walk them through the process as well. So where we're seeing good adoption is in branch. Grayson Hall : Yes, and, I think that if you look at our ATM network, we've continued to invest in that channel, and we've imaged-enabled all of our traditional ATMs. And we're seeing customer transactional behavior improve at what we would call a somewhat traditional ATM. We've been encouraged by the video tellers. But it also has been a learning process. We found some places it worked great and some places not so great. We think it's an interesting technology. We think that there is a place for it in our channel portfolio. But I would tell you, we're still in the early stages of that, even with 90 units in our portfolio. 90 units, even that regard, that is fairly small investment, but it's allowing us to learn how we might deploy it on a larger basis. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Grayson Hall : Hey. Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Hey, good morning, Grayson. Good morning, David. First question, just on the capital markets frontier within fees. It's not a good quarter, down a little bit, but expected. You talked about that being a big contributor to fee growth this year. Can you talk about just pipelines, where it's coming from and how much more you might have to still hire to build -- bulk that business up? Thanks. John Turner : This is John Turner. We expect it to be a nice contributor to revenue growth, non-interest revenue growth through the balance of the year. I think what you're seeing is the maturation of the various product offerings that we have put together and the capabilities that we've developed. For the quarter, the growth in revenue over - year-over-year growth in revenue was broad-based across a number of different product categories, whether it was long-term real estate financing products, it was M&A, it was loan syndications, all improved year-over-year, and again, I think really reflect the maturation of the capabilities and our team's having better conversations with our customers about how we can meet their specific needs. In terms of investments, we're continuing to recruit and will continue to recruit. We see some capabilities that we still probably would aspire to have or to continue to build out. And so we expect capital markets to continue to grow nicely in 2018 on into 2019. Pipelines are pretty good for the second quarter and into part of the third at this point. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. And then my last - my second question, just on all things credit continue to look excellent, all measures and you had another big quarter of reserve release, some - I know you're saying bottom end of the charge-ups this year, but is it also fair to say that there's still an amount of release that we could still see even from here? Thanks, guys. David Turner : Yes, Ken. So we don't forecast what the reserve percentage is going to be. We're at 105%. We still have nonperforming assets. While they're down 75 basis points, we think there's room to continue to improve. We're encouraged by that. The strength of the commercial customer, the strength of the consumer is there. There are elements of consumer that ticked up just a little bit. Card would be one. But we see the consumer being very stable. We just don't think that the consumer credit metrics improved as much as we believe the commercial credit metrics can continue to come down, which manifest themselves in past -- I mean, nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. So there's always a possibility for a reserve release, it depends on what happens with the criticized and classifieds and we'll let the model run and speak for itself. Grayson Hall : Well, I do think you saw this quarter the very encouraging improvement in our credit metrics. A big part of that was payoffs and paydowns on some adversely rated credits that quite frankly we did not anticipate. Those are very difficult to forecast, but it's also encouraging that those customers can find alternative forms of financing today. And so we do anticipate that there's an opportunity for that trend to continue through the rest of the year. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thanks, again. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Spahr : Hi, good morning. My question is just a follow-up on the Simplify and Grow strategy and the role of technology. And the March reorg that you had, where you're putting technology under John Owen, the philosophy behind that? And also a lot of the tech spend seems to be self-funding. Do you think that's going to continue through 2018 -- I mean, sorry, 2019. Thank you. Grayson Hall : Yes, I mean, if you look back historically, we've had a very consistent investment strategy into technology. We've not varied that a lot year-to-year. I think we've been pretty disciplined in that regard. And we're quite proud of the technology platform we've built. My background for the bulk of my career was in technology. John Owen has a similar background as well, and John has worked hard to strengthen and align the strategy, in particular, around our consumer customers with all the attention to digital channels that we have. As you know, Scott Peters runs our Consumer Banking Group, and he and John work together. We have an approach, from a technology perspective, of not being the leader, but being an aggressive follower of proven technology. And that strategy has worked well for us. We have done a number of upgrades in technology over the past few quarters, substantial upgrade on human resources work -- technology; wealth management, complete upgrade of that infrastructure. And so -- and in addition, treasury management. So we continue to make improvements. We get a lot of internal, external benchmarks that would indicate that that's working. So John, elaborate, if you would. John Owen : Just a couple of points to reiterate. From a technology standpoint, we've been consistent even through the financial crisis with - and really significant investments in technology. If I think about consumer for a minute, we're very fortunate to operate on one consumer platform across all of our 1,470 branches. That gives us an advantage over competitors that have multiple platforms that they have to maintain and change over time. We also offer really good digital capabilities, invested heavily on our digital space in both online and mobile banking. Our customers give us good feedback. We have J.D. Power. They really survey our customers every quarter and give feedback on where we can make changes and where we can improve. And we come in every quarter in the top quartile in terms of our channel capabilities. From an ATM and video teller standpoint, rolled-out deposits, smart ATMs across our entire footprint, about 90 video tellers, we mentioned earlier, were testing. So a lot of investment both in the digital space and ATM space and branch channel. I'll move on to the wealth business. As Grayson mentioned, we converted about 14 platforms on our SEI platform, which really is a state-of-the-art platform, great customer experience, great associate experience, also gives us a better price point, if you will, going forward. From a commercial standpoint, our team has done really good job of inputting new iTreasury platform, which gives us a much better user interface, better reporting, better analytics in the iTreasury space. And they're working very hard with nCino to roll out new small business and commercial platforms. So a lot of good things happening. I'll tell you, it's one of those areas where you'll never be done. We're going to continually have to invest in the digital space and really balance out where we make our investments and where we place our bets. But I feel good about the platform we have in place. Christopher Spahr : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FDR. Steve Moss : Good morning. I just want to flesh out the margin expectations for the second quarter here a bit more. In particular, obviously, you should benefit from the rate hike. But it looks like your borrowings came down at period-end and probably have a little bit more margin expansion than what I would just expect from a straight rate hike. David Turner : Well, so we have a day count change going into the second quarter. So don't forget that's two points going the other way, and we were up four points this quarter as a result of day account. When you consider that and you consider the full quarter benefit of the rate hike and where we are, that - we would expect stable to up modestly in terms of margin, overcoming that two point decline for day count. And we feel much better about our NII growth for the year, which is why we changed our outlook for the entire year to that -- to the 4% to 6% range. So we think we're well positioned to take advantage of not only this past rate increase but what might be coming in the future, which we have one full rate increase baked into our expectations for the remainder of the year. Steve Moss : Okay. And then with regard to the capital deployment and targeted CET1. I know you're still pretty high here. Obviously, you did an aggressive asset last year. How close do you think you can approach your 9.5% CET1 target by June 2019? David Turner : June '19, we would get pretty close by then. We really have been talk about trying to get to 9.5% by the end of this year. We've messaged we can't quite get there, but we'll get awful close, I think, by the middle of the next year based on what we know today, that we'd be right on top of that. Now things can change. Risk profiles can change, the world can change, that's a long time. But based on our forecast right now, we'll be right on top of it a year from now. Steve Moss : Okay. And do you expect the -- okay, and then by the -- do you expect the proposed NPR -- with the proposed NPR, you could lower your capital target further? David Turner : Well, the way we think about it, forget regulatory supervision and that. We set our capital base on how much capital we think we need to run our business appropriately based on the risk profile that we have. It's not about running our capital down as low as we possibly could get it. It's the optimization. It's the right amount for that. And so as risk profiles change up and down, those capital targets will change up and down. What happens in the NPR, if it makes it a little easier for us to manage it, based on our own capital planning process versus waiting for a non-objection once a year. We do see it as favorable and not having risk-weighted assets and increasing. We see at this favorable that you don't have to consider share repurchases in an adverse scenario. So I think it would be incrementally helpful. I don't know that, that changes how we think about what our target needs to be though. Steve Moss : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe staying with the capital points. In the past, you've talked about preferred issuance as a possibility. I mean, does that kind of go away now? Or is that something that you still might need to do as you bring the CET1 down to the 9.5%? David Turner : Yes, Geoffrey. We've always believed that we need - again, optimization is -- optimization in terms of total capital and the capital stack that is common and preferred. And we've espoused having preferred, that's about 1.5 points more than our Common Equity Tier 1. We've been satisfying that preferred component of the stack with common. And that's awful expensive for us. So we see, over time, that we will trade out some common for preferred, and you ought to expect that to happen sometime in 2019 as we get our Common Equity Tier 1 down closer to that 9.5% level, but I have to backfill our Tier 1 with the preferred issuance. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Grayson Hall : Morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hello. I'm not sure you guys commented on it in some of the early remarks. But just on the securities book, the size of the securities book going forward, how should we think about that going from here? It came down a little bit versus the fourth quarter levels. And obviously, also a function of both loans and deposit growth, but how do you think about the levels there going forward? David Turner : Yes, Matt. It's David. I think if you look at the percentage of earning assets and earning securities, I think that's going to be relatively stable. I do think if things change with specific designation and things were LCR are as important, you could see the makeup of certain securities changing out. For instance, we're using Ginnie Mae [ph] securities to help us on our high-quality liquid assets. And perhaps, we could put those to work a little more effectively for us in time. So I think that we would - we're going to continue to evaluate that and make sure we have an appropriate amount of liquidity, that we have the proper duration in the book. And as we continue to grow earning assets, we'll have some portion of that in securities. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And what's the yield pickup if there was some flexibility on the liquidity rules that you would get on a securities book overall? David Turner : Yes, I don't think that's -- I don't think, Matt, that's fairly meaningful right now. It's not that much. I do think we have more ability to continue to pick up yield, if you will, on just the front book rolling off and the back book coming on in terms of investments, given the rate environment right now. So we have about $3 billion that'll roll out, that'll help us pick up about 70 - roughly 70 basis points of yield. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Grayson Hall : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Grayson. How are you? Grayson Hall : Doing great. Gerard Cassidy : Good. Couple of questions for you. You obviously have very strong credit quality like many of your peers. And it was interesting to see that the criticized loans have steadily declined now for over 12 months quite materially. And can you share with us, was that energy related where you had to put some on two years ago and now they have finally come off? Or did - and the second part of that, too, did the change in the tax laws in any of your nonperforming loans or criticized loans? Did the company just get a benefit because of lower taxes and, therefore, they may have come off the criticized list? Grayson Hall : Yes, I think I'll ask John Turner to speak in a little more detail. But clearly, we had a material exposure to the energy sector, and it's taken some time to work through that exposure as well as we had some weather-related exposure because of some hurricanes that came through Texas and through Florida. And so as time has elapsed and the economy has stayed fairly steady, and quite frankly, as liquidity has been so available that you've seen an awful lot of the composition of our loan portfolio shift and change, and as you pointed out, has improved dramatically. But I'll ask John to speak with a little more color in that regard. John Turner : So I would say, clearly, we benefited from some improvement in the energy sector. But I would suggest the improvement is really the result of the focus that we've had on derisking certain asset classes, certain portfolios, over the last 2-plus years and improving the overall quality of our portfolio. And as we've done that, what we've seen is a significant shift in the quality. At the same time, we've had the opportunity to either see companies exit the bank or, over time, we're a payer because of the work that we've been doing with them. And naturally, I think what's had the greatest impact on asset quality is our focus across the bank on derisking and managing the overall credit quality of our portfolio origination. Credit quality is much better over the last couple of years as well, and so I think that's what you're seeing. With respect to the question about taxes, it's too early, I think, to have seen any benefit, for companies to have seen any benefit that would impact credit quality. We certainly would expect that some would experience improved cash flows, and that will help us likewise in the energy business. We still have some portion of that portfolio that's adversely rated as prices continue to firm up. And we see cash flows improve there as well. I think you can expect some additional improvement resulting from the energy portfolio improving over time. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then as a follow-up, changing tack here. You guys gave us some good color on the investments you're making in technology, particularly on the consumer side of the business. And there's been a lot of talk about all of the biggest banks spending billions of dollars on technology and how are the regional banks going to compete. The question is, do you look at your technology and the innovations you're making as a competitive advantage? Or is it really just the ticket to get into the ballpark, and to play on the field you got to execute? And if you don't have the technology, you're not going to even get into the ballpark, rather than that, again, being your competitive advantage. How do you guys look at it? Grayson Hall : Well, it's a great question, and I think one that there's a number of different narratives in the marketplace that are driving fairly substantial technology investments across the industry. I do think that the industry broadly benefits from the investments being made in bank technology. As we said earlier in the meeting, our strategy is not to be necessarily leading -- on the leading edge of a lot of these technologies, but to be an aggressive follower of proven technologies. We believe that customers enjoy using all of our channels. And we see activity across multiple channels by the same customer on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And we try to work hard on trying to make that a very friendly, consistent experience when a customer comes into one of our branches or comes through a digital channel or an ATM channel. We want to see the same information and be able to do -- have the same capabilities across those channels. We think it's making a big difference in our business, but all of our channels are still relevant. I do think you're seeing this narrative about the dollars being spent on technology and that providing some level of competitive advantage. Whether that advantage is sustainable over time really comes back to execution. And we think we're doing a particularly good job of that. We're growing accounts. We're going households. We're growing balances. We really tried to rationalize the composition of our deposit balance sheet, and we've made some tremendous strides in that regard. I'm really proud of where we're at on deposits today. Very loyal, very granular, have a high customer satisfaction rate. And technology is a big part of that. But it's not all of it. John, I wouldn't add to that if you would. John Owen : The only thing I would add, a couple of comments to Grayson. I'll go back to what I said earlier in the digital and mobile space. We won't spend more than some banks in that space, but we look at it through a different lens. And the lens I would look at it from is, what are our customers telling us about what our channel offers today? And I'll go back to J.D. Powers. Again, J.D. Powers assesses our branch network, ATM network, mobile and online and our call center as well. And when we look at it from a customer standpoint, we're consistently ranked in the top quartile. I think that's, to me, a more important metric than how many dollars you spend on it. So when we stack up in top quartile, and our branch network, our online actually came in number 2 out of top 23 banks last quarter, I think that's the land that we'll spend more time looking on. As far as innovations and things like that, a couple of things I'd point to, I think our remote deposit capture. We were not the first bank to launch remote deposit capture. But what our consumer team did, I thought was very innovative, which is they came out with a remote deposit capture several years ago that offers the customer choice. And that choice is around when do they get credit for that deposit. Is it immediate, and I can pay for that and get immediate credit, which is great for small businesses that are working free cash flow? Or they can do standard, which is a pre-deposit. So things like that. We're not going to be first but, we can improve on what we're doing there. The only other thing I would point out would be AI. There's a lot of discussion and talk about AI in the market. We've been working with it now for over a year. In our contact center, we're using AI for our agents to be able to really chat with IBM Watson and answer customers' questions quicker in a more accurate way. And there are things like that, that we're doing that are just happening behind the scenes, but we are innovating. Grayson Hall : Thank you, John. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. If I could squeeze one more in, Grayson, because of your background. When you look at technology, we started back with the mainframes, then we went to minicomputers, then micros, then the Internet, now digital AI. Can you share with us from your experience, how revolution -- is the one we're going right now the biggest of them all or no, you remember 25 years ago, it was even bigger? Grayson Hall : It all depends on how you measure it. We - obviously, this industry spent an awful lot on technology over the last two or three decades and really has sort of transformed how we serve customers and how we comply with regulation and compliance and how we analyze risks and how we extend credit. It's just transformed every part of our business. And I would say that, for the most part, it's gotten better, faster, cheaper every year. Probably the largest transformation that has occurred has been the mobile phone. That mobile device, that mobile smartphone is just, really, has been the largest game-changer I saw in my career being involved in technology. Because early on, computing was too heavy to carry on a mobile phone and was relatively slow and extremely expensive. And we've seen that really come down over the years. And so the cost of storing data, the cost of computing data has really improved. It's made it available to most of our population. And so it's changed the way we serve customers. The question is, is how much value, how much sustainable value do you achieve as a bank by investing in technology. I do believe you have to continue to invest. But as we've seen, computing becomes less expensive over time. And so you have to keep innovating, keep investing to, I think, to stay competitive and serve your customers the right way. But I still believe the basics haven't changed because the people who win are real smart about what technologies they pick, and they're really good at implementing and executing that strategy. And so I think the execution is a much bigger question than how many dollars you spent last year. Dollars matter, but execution determines who sustains the competitive advantage. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I really appreciate that color. Thank you. Grayson Hall : Thank you. Operator, is there any further questions? Operator : No, there are no other questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Hall, for any closing remarks. Grayson Hall : Well, again, thank you for your time and your interest in Regions. We do hope that today's discussion was helpful to everyone, and we look forward to next quarter. So thank you. We stand adjourned. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I'd like to remind everyone that all participants all lines have been placed on listen only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. John Turner, our Chief Executive Officer, will provide highlights of our financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through an overview of the quarter. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earning supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter results. Our performance clearly demonstrates that we are continuing to successfully execute our strategic plans, building long-term sustainable growth while delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Our reported earnings from continuing operations of $362 million reflected an increase of 21% compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Importantly, we delivered solid revenue growth while maintaining a focus on disciplined expense management. Of note, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased to highest level in 10 years. In addition, this marks another very strong quarter with respect to asset quality, as virtually every credit metric improved. In terms of the overall environment, we remained encouraged by improving economic conditions as well as continued improvement in customer sentiment. We remain focused on generating prudent and softer loan growth, while also meeting the evolving expectations of our customers. Once again, we are proud of our robust capital planning process. Our plan of capital actions received no objection in the recent CCAR results, and we're set to deliver a robust return of capital to our shareholders, while maintaining appropriate levels to meet customer needs and support organic growth. With respect to our business strategy, we are committed to the diligent execution of our plan and are making notable progress with respect to our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative, while much has been accomplished, the process is ongoing, and we currently have approximately 40 initiatives underway, ended accelerating revenue growth, driving operational efficiencies, expanding use of technology and ultimately further improving the customer experience. Through this continuous improvement process, we aim to deliver consistent and reliable results over the long-term. For a while now, we've been speaking about four key strengths we believe to provide considerable momentum for Regions. First is our asset sensitivity and finding advantage, driven by our low cost and lower deposit base. This provides significant franchise value and a competitive advantage, particularly in a rising rate environment. Second relates to asset quality. We experienced another quarter of broad-based improvements in credit quality and continue to expect modest improvement throughout the remainder of the year. Further, we believe the de-risking and portfolio shaping activities we have completed, combined with our sound risk management practices that positioned us well for the next credit cycle. Third, our capital position supports additional capital returns as we move towards our target Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. The execution of which was again validated through the recent CCAR process. And finally, we expect additional improvements in core performance overtime through our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative, which is well underway as evidenced by our actions today. As we look ahead, Regions is well positioned and we're building momentum every day. We have clear plans and a strong team, and our focus on effectively executing our plans while adapting to the ever changing environment remaining steadfast. We do not anticipate major changes to the Company's strategic direction. Going forward, we will build on the solid foundation already established, delivering consistent and reliable financial results, and creating a culture of continues improvement our priorities. Providing best in class customer service and unwavering commitment to our associates and communities will not change. Grayson Hall led the Company through one of the most challenging periods in our industry's history. His leadership and commitment has positioned the Company well for the future. On behalf of our associates, we thank Grayson for his 38 years of dedicated service, and I personally want to thank him for his guidance, counsel and support. With that, I'll now turn it over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John, and good morning. Let's begin with average loans. Adjusted average loan balances increased $382 million over the prior quarter, driven by modest growth in both the consumer and business portfolios. Growth in the consumer portfolio was driven primarily by our expanded point of sale partnerships as well as residential mortgage and indirect vehicle lending. Average loan growth in the business lending portfolio was again driven by C&I lending, primarily from our specialized lending areas. Consumer lending should continue to produce consistent loan growth across most categories, and C&I should continue to lead growth within business lending. Headwinds associated with previous de-risking efforts in our investor real estate portfolio have slowed, and as a result, we have begun to see a loan growth on an ending basis largely in our term real estate product. Let's move onto deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on valuable, low cost consumer, and business services relationship deposits while reducing certain higher cost brokered and collateralized deposits. As a result, total average deposits declined modestly during the quarter; however, average consumer segment deposits experienced solid growth of over $1 billion consistent with our relationship banking focus. Our deposit advantage has generated from our granular and loyal deposit base. During the second quarter, interest-bearing deposit cost totaled 38 basis points by total funding cost remain low at 52 basis points illustrating the strength of our deposit franchise. Cumulative deposit betas through the current rising rate cycle are only 14%, and importantly, consumer retail deposit betas remained low at approximately 1%. As expected, commercial deposits have been more reactive with a cumulative beta of approximately 44%, driven primarily by large corporate and brokered deposits. We believe our large retail deposit franchise differentiates us in the marketplace. As such, we are in a position to maintain a lower deposit beta relative to peers. Our customer base is also highly engaged with over 55% of consumer checking customers utilizing multiple channels and more than 75% of all interactions are now digital. The number of active mobile banking customers has increased 12% compared to the prior year, and active mobile deposit customers has more than doubled. We continue to focus on being our customers' primary bank as 93% of our consumer checking households include a high-quality primary checking account. So, now let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income increased 2% over the prior quarter and net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 3.49%. These increases were driven primarily by higher market interest rates and prudent deposit cost management. With respect to full year 2018, the current market expectation for the fed to continue increasing rates combined with better than forecasted deposit pricing will likely push NII towards the upper end of our 4% to 6% guidance on a non-fully taxable equivalent basis. Specific to the third quarter of 2018, current market expectations for our rate increase in September along with similar deposit betas to what we have experienced in recent quarters are expected to result in another solid quarter of growth in net interest income along with modest net interest margin expansion. Remember, the third quarter will have one additional day that will benefit net interest income, but reduced net interest margin. We also experienced a good quarter as it relates to fee revenue. Adjusted non-interest income increased 2% with growth across most non-interest revenue categories during the quarter. Keep in mind, the first quarter benefited from net gains associated with the sale of certain low income housing investments, and a positive valuation adjustment associated with a private equity investment totaling $13 million that did not repeat this quarter. These gains were included in other non-interest income. With respect to corporate fee revenue categories, the Company's investments in capital markets continue to pay off as a business delivered another record quarter. Revenues totaled $57 million with all businesses within capital markets contributing. The second quarter increase was led by merger and acquisition advisory services and the customer derivative activity. Consumer categories remain an important component of fee revenue. To that point, service charges and card and ATM fees grew by 2% and 8% respectively. This growth has been aided by year-to-date checking account growth of approximately 1.2%. In addition, revenue growth was supported by an increase in debit transactions of 9% and an increase in credit card spending of 10% during the second quarter. Mortgage income remained stable during the quarter despite seasonally higher production due primarily to a 25 basis point reduction in gain on sale. While production is lower across the industry, we continue to expect better performance relative to peers due to our historically higher mix of purchase versus refinance volume. We continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our residential mortgage servicing portfolio, and during the quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase the rights to service approximately $3.6 billion of mortgage loans, with an expected close date of July 31, 2018, and it's subject to customary closing conditions. Increasing servicing income is expected to help offset the impact of lower mortgage production. Wealth management income was up modestly in the quarter driven by 12% increase in investment services fee income. Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense increased approximately 2%, attributable primarily to increases in professional fees and expenses associated with Visa Class B shares sold in the prior year. Excluding the impact of severance charges, salaries and benefits decreased approximately to 1%, reflecting staffing reductions and lower payroll taxes, partially offset by annual merit increases. As a result of our efforts to rationalize and streamline our organization, staffing levels declined by 340 full-time equivalent positions compared to the prior quarter and approximately 1,100 full-time equivalent positions compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Year-to-date, full-time equivalent positions have declined by approximately 700 positions. Further salaries and benefits expense reductions are expected in the third and fourth quarters as approximately 500 additional position reductions will benefit the run rate. Keep in mind, these numbers do not include the 644 position reductions associated with Regions insurance. In addition, we continue to take a hard look at occupancy expense and will exit approximately 500,000 square feet this year benefiting 2019 and beyond. This amount does not include another 200,000 square feet of reductions associated with Regions insurance. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.4% down slightly from the prior quarter, and through the first six months of 2018, the Company has generated 2.7% of adjusted positive operating leverage. For full year 2018, we continue to expect adjusted positive operating leverage of 3% to 5%, relatively stable adjusted expenses and adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 60%. Let's shift to asset quality. Broad-based asset quality improvement continued during the quarter. Non-performing, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans, as well as total delinquencies all declined. Non-performing loan excluding loans held for sale decreased to 0.74% of loans outstanding, the lowest level since 2007. Net charge-offs totaled 32 basis points of average loans and 8 basis point decline from the prior quarters adjusted ratio. The provision for loan losses approximated net charge-offs during the quarter and included the release of our remaining hurricane specific loan loss allowance of $10 million. The allowance for loan losses totaled 1.4% of total loans outstanding and 141% of total non-accrual loans. Let me give you some brief comments related to capital and liquidity. As John mentioned, we are pleased with our CCAR results and remain committed to maintaining prudent capital ratios while possibly investing in our businesses for future growth and delivering a solid return of capital to our shareholders. On July 2nd, we completed the sale of our Regions interest subsidiary, the after-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $200 million and Common Equity Tier 1 capital generated was approximately $300 million. Our capital plan incorporates the capital generated from this transaction, and it is included in our board authorized share repurchase program for up to $2.03 billion in common shares over the next four quarters. Subject to our board's approval, the plan also includes a 56% increase in Region's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14 per share beginning in the third quarter. Regarding 2018 expectations, our full-year expectations remain unchanged and are summarized again on this slide for your reference. So in conclusion, we are pleased with our second quarter results and believe our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative along with other opportunities and competitive advantages position us well for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. Dana Nolan : Thank you, David. As it relates to Q&A, please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the loan growth front, I want to see if you can give us a bit more color on the, where you see shift of the drivers of loan growth through the back half coming from, and your full-year outlook of low single-digits and it seems like at this point you might be trending at the lower end of that. Do you see it that way? Or do you think you can break to the upside a little bit through the back half? John Turner : Well, I would say first of all, we are affirming our current guidance for low single-digit loan growth excluding the run off this targeted and indirect portfolio and the TDR sales obviously. By focus on the consumer side of the business, we feel pretty good about our forecast and we look at mortgage, we expect it generally to be flat. I think we see raw in the HELOC portfolio and the balance of our consumer business should grow modestly, we believe across most of the sectors and the remaining part of the year. On the corporate side of the business, our pipelines are good. They have improved since the first quarter and they continue to be pretty solid. Our customers are optimistic, but I would say there is still a bit cautious. We're seeing customers use a lot of their liquidity to fund their additional borrowing needs or what would have traditionally been additional borrowing needs and you can see that in some of our deposit balances. But generally if you think about our business in the three segments that we think about them, the corporate banking business, I think will grow modestly through the balance of the year largely as a result of activity within our specialized industries group and more narrow targeted focus by our diversified industry's bankers, and we've seen both of those teams have some success in the first part of the year. In the traditional middle market commercial banking and small business banking, we have renewed focus there that we are beginning to see really get some traction. Owner-occupied real estate which have been running off at a pretty rapid rate through I guess over the last 10 years has really begun to slow and that will help us, we believe see some additional loan growth through the balance of the year. And then finally in real estate, we had indicated we thought in the second quarter we would begin to see some modest growth. You remember that we have been de-risking that portfolio exiting many of the multifamily construction when loans that we have in the books and that has been successful I think, term lending was very competitive, it has begun to have a positive impact on our portfolio. So, we saw some nice loan growth at the end of the quarter and in real estate banking, and so all-in-all, I think our guidance is solid. I would not say that at this point we guide towards the upper end of range, I think it would be lower end to the middle of the range. But we do believe that, we will achieve those objectives, and if, we do we will meet all of our other targets as a result to that. John Pancari : Then in terms of your margins, I saw some pretty good expansion again this quarter and probably would have even been higher, it\u2019s not for the leverage lease transaction. But just wondering are the impairment that is, I want to get your updated thoughts on the sensitivity to the ongoing fed moves, but also rising betas? What's your updated sensitivity to each incremental 25 basis point that hike? David Turner : I think John, so our -- this is David. Our expectation for the year is -- our beta thus far is 14% as I mentioned earlier. We do think that picks up with the back half of the year, but if we look at 2018, we think the beta in 30% ranges is what's baked into the guidance that we've given you. Thus far, we've outperformed our expectation on beta, and rates have come in faster than we had anticipated as well. And so, we are reiterating our guidance on net interest income growth this year to the higher end of that 4% to 6% range, we think we can get the higher end of that. As it relates to next quarter, we think will have another solid quarter of growth in NII, and we think our margin will grew modestly because it has overcome about two points of for the next quarter. So, I think that we feel very good about our expectations. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Jennifer Demba : Just wondering, if could clarify what you're M&A interest and capacity is at this point? John Turner : Sure. We have an M&A team they are charged with finding both bank and non-bank opportunities, and we've had some success acquiring non-bank businesses, mortgage servicing rights and other loan portfolios in fact we point to BlackArch Partners and that investment is being a real half point in the quarter in terms of their contribution. And we will continue to look for those kinds of opportunities because non-bank opportunities help us fill gaps and our capabilities meet customer needs and importantly row and diversify revenue. Bank M&A is a good bit more challenging, and we think about where Regions trades relative to our peers, we are trading relative to targets I would say, likely targets. We are trading at a discount, and as a result, the economics just don\u2019t work for us. We look at our plans and our opportunities and we think they're significant. We benefit from rising rates. We have a good plan to return capital to our shareholders which should generate outsize returns. We think through our Simplify and Grow initiatives that there is a real opportunity to improve our core business. And so, we're just not going to do a transaction that would be significantly dilutive to our shareholders and in this environment. Let\u2019s not say that we\u2019re not going to continue to look, we will do that. We learn as we do. We\u2019re going to be very conservative, very thoughtful. We will seek to build relationships with potential sellers. We will watch the market, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined in that regard, principally because again, we have the opportunity we think to take advantage of a number of other levers that will drive outsized returns for shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : In terms of the balance sheet mix, you haven\u2019t had a lot of earning asset growth, which is allowed you to be I think in part so disciplined on the deposit side. How much more shrinkage do you think you could see in terms of the interest-bearing -- sorry, the non-interest-bearing deposit side? And at what point do you think that you might have to just go out into the market and just to keep up, with hopefully is -- now a better trajectory on loan growth side? David Turner : Again, this is David. So you mentioned us being disciplined on pricing on the deposit side, but I would tell you, we've been very disciplined on the left side of the balance sheet. We want to grow loans. We did grow loans this quarter, but we\u2019re going to remain very disciplined, making sure that when we layout capital to our customers to serve their needs that we paid and we have an appropriate return on capital that we put out. We have a low loan to deposit ratio relative to our peers. And staying disciplined unless on the left side of the balance sheet, let\u2019s us be even more discipline on the right side. You are correct to see that not interest-bearing deposits have been put work, a lot of that has been on the corporate banking side where corporate banking customers are looking for alternatives to generate yield. Some of that's gone into interest-bearing accounts with that. Some of that's been utilized as John mentioned earlier to fund capital expenditures and put the excess cash to work, and but at some point we believe, those actions will dissipate and we'll be to grow loans. We are constantly looking for relationship deposits, whether it'd be on the consumer side of the business service side. That will always be important to us. But we don't see any need in the near-term to have to go out and bid up deposits from a cost standpoint. That being said, we do have promotions like others do and we will look at opportunities to strengthen the market, leveraging that, but wholesale changes in our deposit structure is not in the order at this point. John Turner : Yes, I will just make another maybe two points, Ken. One is, if you look at growth in consumer deposits, we grew demand deposits in the consumer business by 6.4% year-over-year and continue to see good growth in checking accounts and household. And so, we believe that we will see nice steady growth on -- in consumer deposits. The second thing I would say is. We are again reiterating our guidance for low single-digit deposit growth through the -- end the year. And so, we do expect that will continue to grow deposits and finish the year with little growth. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR. Steve Moss : On the commercial real estate growth, here, I was just wondering we\u2019ve heard more comments around competition and tighter spreads. Wondering, what you guys are seeing as relates to that? And what types of properties are driving growth? John Turner : Yes, so a great question. We are seeing a lot of competition particularly in that term lending product. Spreads have compressed 50 basis points or more since to the beginning of year. We've had to be very selective in seeking out opportunities in the space. The growth we've had, though modest, has been in multifamily and office primarily where think we have a good expertise. This audience that -- we have been managing that portfolio very actively for quite some time and today it represents about 7% of our total loan portfolio down from, at one-time bar in the 30% range back during the crises. So, we believe it's a business that we can and will continue to grow modestly and provide really nice fee income opportunities for us, and you see that in our capital markets business and improving. Also presents an opportunity for us to grow deposits as we begin to develop more relationships with the owner operator customer who is the term lending customer. So we will grow it modestly, but carefully and again manage it I think very judiciously. Steve Moss : And then on the securities portfolio here, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the balances going forward as the yield curve has narrowed? And what are your thoughts, if they convert in the next couple of quarters? David Turner : Yes, so in terms of the level of securities or the percentage for earnings assets, we don\u2019t anticipate any significant change there. If we do get some liquidity, LCR relief, we may change out some Fannie Mae securities and put them to work more effectively. But right now, we think that we just continuing to manage the book like we are with the same duration. We have a lift coming from fixed price lending and our securities book, even if rates stay flat to where they are right now as we re-rate some $12 to $14 billion worth of assets over a given year. So an inversion that you spoke, we think would be more central bank driven than a precursor to a downturn. And even with that and if rates have shifted up and re-pricing comes through, we still have a very significant tailwind in help us to continue to growing NII. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : I wanted to ask about loan yield. Your C&I yield obviously picked up with the higher rates, but significantly less I think than a lot of other banks who benefited from this blowing out of LIBOR relative to the fed funds rate and maybe the leverage lease trend right down had maybe on the margin something to do with it. But I'm curious, why you're not seeing a bit more of a yield pickup as some of your yield or some of your competitors have? And does it have to do with hedging strategy? Does it have to do with the structure? But it's been over the last few quarters about 10 bps sequential with every rate hike. So I'm curious, why if there is something there that is different about your C&I growth or how you manage through the portfolio? John Turner : I'll take a shot and maybe David can follow. Typically when our C&I business has been very much of the relationship oriented business going back a very long time is generally built around our core markets Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee where we have very long and deep relationships. We enjoy a significant demand deposits associated with those relationships in that business, and while we don't -- as we look at our peers typically don't get the same yield on the loan side of our business. We enjoy we think a greater demand deposits and so we view it from a relationship perspective. We think that there's a fair trade-off there that\u2019s part of it. Another part of it is that we have been seeking to grow both our government and institutional banking business, which is a little more competitive, and yields are narrower, and separately, we've been working hard to stem the tide runoff in our owner-occupied real estate portfolio. And so, deals there have been compressed a bit to. David Turner : I'll add other thing and really you got to look at the whole relationship first, taking apart loan side versus deposits. But we didn't have the leverage lease impairment $5 million you pointed out, that's about three basis points of that change too. So that\u2019s other piece of this. Saul Martinez : Yes, it's just kind of hard to triangulate though, if some of your peers having 30 bps to 30 plus bps, yield pickup sequentially pointing to the higher LIBOR, and you guys have been pretty consistent at 10 basis points for quarter when you have a rate hike. So, everything you said make sense, but I want to know if there is anything -- it has anything to do with how you -- because hedging strategy and structure of the loan because it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect versus what we've seen some of the other banks reported. John Turner : So, you got to look at mix, you have to look at everybody's hedging strategy. But if you look at our assets sensitivity, 25% of its on the short-term, 25% of its on the middle term and 50s on the long end. So that will have a little bit of the dampening impact in terms of rate increases that move up. And so, I think that it's really hard to compare peers to peer. There are a lot puts and takes on it. Saul Martinez : If I could just get in a quick one, the indirect other consumer obviously growing pretty, pretty well the green sky. But where do you think -- can you remind us, where you think that book can grow to in terms of absolute size over the next year or two? John Turner : So, we do have limits in terms of how much we want, our indirect other get to. Right now, our indirect other consumer about a 7 billion, we\u2019re looking at that number to be in that $2 billion range. So, some growth there, but not a extraordinary growth. Saul Martinez : 2 billion by year end. John Turner : I would say overtime, yes. Operator : Next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Maybe following up on the earlier discussion on M&A. Can you kind of outline both on the non-banks side and the banks side either from a product point of view or geography points of view, other areas where if the prices rise and the economics will rise you be particularly interested from a strategic perspective? David Turner : With respect to non-bank, I think our focus has been on, as I said earlier, adding capabilities so whether it'd be in capital markets or in wealth management as an example, adding products capabilities that help us fill gaps to meet customer needs. We've been acquiring loan portfolios, mortgage servicing rights, and those things and we'll continue to do. We have capacity within our mortgage servicing operation. I think we do that well and so we will continue to likely add to that portfolio. On the bank side, typically our interest is going to be in footprint. We talk about size and I think that ranges, but our conversations have been in the $3 billion to $15 billion kind of range. We're not interested, as I said earlier, and doing the transaction that would be a significantly dilutive intangible book value and earned backs are important to us. I hope that gives you a little bit of perspective. Geoffrey Elliott : And then, a quick one on the CCAR, it looks from the CCAR results like there is some preferred issuance baked into the ask, as I think there was last year as well. Could you discuss a little bit what those you confirm that's the case? And then discus the circumstances when you'd be expecting to issue preferred? David Turner : So, Geoffrey, originally, we had a preferred issuance build in, but that was in 2019. We do need to continue to watch changes regulatory changes with regards to the SAB in terms of how that might impact our capital ratios, in terms of will it have us, have more common and therefore negate the need to have preferred stock overtime. There is more to come there, but we want to make sure that so we have an appropriate amount of capital Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1. Our focus right now in the short term has been to get our common equity down to our 9.5% target range, and as we do that, we need to make sure we backfill appropriately for Tier 1. And if we don't get relief through the SAB, then we'll a preferred issuance in their right now baked in '19. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you can talk about the kind of relationship of provision expense to charge offs, look at the next few quarter obviously this quarter, I was very close to matching after a couple of quarters of released, but with loans starting to grow again here. I'm wondering if you give some color on that. Barbara Godin : Yes, I think you will continue to see a match provision to charge off and there could be a slight build relative to the loan growth as one would expect. David Turner : Okay, and in terms of the loans that you are adding now, say the indirect consumer which is in that bag, but the growth that you are getting their in terms of some of the other portfolios. Are they given the lost content of what's being added as higher than what's lending off? Or is it still some kind of underlying de-risking, I would say whole back we runs off of things like that? Barbara Godin : I think we're going to see some modest improvement in our numbers across all of our portfolios over the balance of the year, definitely, and what we are putting on the is that very high quality, very happy with it. What we're seeing with those loans is in fact they are performing very well and we would expect them to continue to perform well, including better than those that are paying off. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I knew that there is -- you've mentioned briefly some, what trajectory is Simplify and Grow is. But maybe can you give us a little bit of color to the kinds of actions that have been taken pass quarter or so? And how you expect the operating leverage trajectory to shift from here, as at the run rate that we been seeing over the last year or so? Or do you feel that we\u2019re moving into a peer where there could be a little bit more acceleration in that trajectory? David Turner : John Owen is leading that work. I asked him to answer your question and you maybe David could follow on as well. John Owen : Good morning everyone. We\u2019re making good progress on Simplify and Grow initiative is. We said earlier we got about 40 initiatives that are underway. We started this about seven months ago and I think we're off to a really good start. Let me give you a couple of examples of products we have underway. I think that might provide some color and background. First, let focus on to be our consumer lending space, we got a team working on how we take all of our consumer lending categories and make them fully 100% digital, meaning a customer can come in and start a digital channel whether it's a mobile device, iPad or laptop, start there and face that loan complete digital. We\u2019re going to do that for all consumer loan categories for well down the road in that process. I will tell you by the end of 2018, we will have the majority of that work done. There will be something we will spill over into 2019, but example of some of the changes we've made, I take the mortgage application process. If we reengineered that process, we\u2019re going through second half about half of the day requirements for the application. That's taking the application time, down from over 15 minutes under 5 minutes. The other thing seeing is a huge shift in adoption in terms of filling out your application in digital format. In December only about 20% of our apps were filled out in the digital space. We\u2019re now about approaching 60% of our application still down the digital space. The other one I would point out, the other initiatives is on our commercial lending process. We've gone through and really put a dedicated team focus at, how do we reengineer that process really with the goal being for us to get a faster answer back to customers. So from applications time to, yes or no to a customer, we drop that by about 70%. And so team has done a great job of making banking much easier for our commercial customers. The last one I would point out would be in our contact center area. We've gone through and used IBM Watson in our contact center really to provide some assistance to our reps, so they can better assist our customers. Couple of use cases that we have deployed, the first being, for certain call types Watson actually take the call, handle the call with the customer, and service that call right there with Watson. We've had about 700,000 calls already year-to-date that Watson has handle that call from start to finish. That\u2019s equivalent to about 55 contact center reps in that initiative alone. The other thing we've done as we gone through and really tried arm our reps with to be able to have quick fast answers back to customers, and we have Watson so that almost in a chat mode. So a customer -- I mean, a rep can actually ask Watson questions when they have a customer on the phone. They have done that 700,000 times year-to-date. And so, a lot of good work there, a lot of good energy. As David mentioned earlier about headcount, and one of the things that if you think about headcount and also corporate real estate, those are two big indicators that you can watch to see us while we're making progress on our Simplify and Grow strategy. We\u2019re down about 770 positions through June and that's a direct result of management actions that had been taken with these 40 plus initiatives that are out there. Also Regions insurance closing on July the 2nd, that's about 644 positions eliminated there. And in the balance of the second half of the year, you will see Simplify and Grow impact probably another 500 positions in the second half of this year. That's over 1,900 positions and what I would tell you is, that will really show up in 2019 when we get the full run rate. The last point I would make would be on a real-estate side. We've got a good opportunity to continue to reduce our space across the bank. We will be down about 700,000 square feet this year. We expect that trend to continue. David Turner : So, Betsy, I'll add to that. So, operating leverage today is 2.7%. We are reiterating our guidance of 3.5% for the year. We get there both by having improvements in revenues whether it'd come from rate balance sheet growth, Simplify and Growth initiatives helps through revenue, and then continuing to watch our cost for the remainder of the year. You will see the benefits that as John just mentioned really ramp up in the third and fourth quarters, such that, gives us confidence that, not only we're going to meet our operating leverage target, but we're also getting our efficiency ratio below the 60% level. Betsy Graseck : Got it. That was a really helpful color. It sounds like you are well prepared for that question. Yes, exactly one other just a separate topic, but David on the capital, I know we talked a little bit about capital and capital return already. Just especially sense the insurance acquisition -- or insurance I sorry, sale is happening this year. Is there any opportunity to do a mid quarter task or a de minimis as well in terms of capital return? David Turner : Well, so, we had baked into our submission to the extent we generate the capital that we were also going to be able to include that and that is in the numbers that you see. So that $300 million has already been asked for. So, there is no need to go back. There is always an opportunity to do back on the de minimis. The de minimis is a fairly small number now and we will have to see circumstances changes. We do not anticipate that, but it's always an option. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush. Peter Winter : I just wanted to follow up on the efficiency ratio looking out longer term, if you're still targeting, bring it down to the mid-50s. And over what timeframe, do you think you can get there? David Turner : So, we've been pretty focused on our '18 to just kind of make sure we meet that. It's the third year of our three-year plan we laid out at Investor Day in November of '15. Now, we are going to have our Investor Day in February of '19 where we will have our scorecard on what we told we are going to do. And that we're going to be laying out expectations for the next three years. You've heard me I mentioned before, I think our industry is going to have to begin more efficient overtime, and I think we will certainly do that. And I think targeting something in the 50, mid 50s to maybe even better than that overtime is on the table. I think you should see us through Simplify and Grow initiatives to get just a little better each quarter, but when can we hit that mid 50s, we haven't really gone out and said that. You're going have to wait and show up in February to here. But I think in the not too distant future, we could actually get there. John Turner : Yes, I would just reiterate that. I think we\u2019re very focused on continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations. And we'd make the point there our Simplify and Grow initiative, we try to be clear that is not a program, it's really about making a cultural shift here at Regions. It's about developing a culture of continuous improvement. We've got to always be looking for how we do we make it easier for our customers and banker do business? How do we improve our processes? How do we drive efficiency to be more effective and deliver more value for our shareholders? So, we are very committed to doing that. Peter Winter : And just a follow up, if I look last year, the share buyback coming out of CCAR. You frontend loaded that buyback. Should we expect kind of similar type trend this year? David Turner : Well, we haven\u2019t led out our timing, Peter, but we have a pretty, pretty tall order to get that done as soon as possible and that's our goal. We are carrying excess capital right now that's really been an anchor from a return standpoint and we would like to get back capital right size, sooner rather than later. So I'll leave it back. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Just one follow-up question for me. You've mentioned that 93% of our container deposits have high quality checking accounts tie to them. Obviously, the consumer beta stands at 1% on accumulative basis. I guess I just want to make sure I am understanding the message correctly a lot of your peers are starting to die towards more aggressive betas going forward. Is it that a lot of your consumer retail accounts are transactional and don\u2019t have that excess cash that potentially could rotate away from Regions into some of these online offering? Are we reading that correctly? David Turner : That\u2019s a big piece of our deposits base and that\u2019s why it's been fairly stable, that\u2019s why it was our beta was low last time, that\u2019s why we think it will be low this time. And we have the core checking account of our consumer base. And that is really, really important, very granular average deposit of about $3,500 in account. So, that\u2019s what makes us unique and that\u2019s how we win from a beta standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG partners. Christopher Marinac : Thanks David. I had a similar question as Erica, but just want to look at it from the angle of the non-metro markets. To what extent does that keep working for you as we get further along in the right cycle? Is that still a benefit that you have? David Turner : Yes, absolutely. We think it's foundational to who we are and non-metro markets, that\u2019s a big part of our deposit base. It's not just deposits but as a whole relationship that we have these customers that are very loyal to us, and we dominate in those market. So it's important for us to continue to provide good solid customer service and we will retain those deposits, which we think again is foundational and really is a differentiator. We've had this strategic advantage for a long time, but without rates rising someone, we couldn't extract value until now. And so, we think that continues on -- in the future. Now offset to that is, our growth relative to some of those smaller markets is it as robust as some of the major metro, which is why you see us -- you've have seen us make some investments in major metros like Atlanta where we can capture some of that faster growth, but we don\u2019t want to abandoned that core customer base in the smaller markets. So, that's really our strategy on both sides. Christopher Marinac : Is there a way to pinpoint the rate advantage between metro versus non-metro even in just on the big picture context? David Turner : We can get back to you on that Chris. Operator : Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : David, can you share with us -- in the securities portfolio, I think, you said that about $12 billion to $14 billion is reinvest every year. Did I hear that correctly? David Turner : That's total assets. Gerard. It's probably 2 billion to 3 billion in the securities book and about 10 to 11 in the loan book. Gerard Cassidy : In the securities book, what yields are you giving up when it rolls off? And where do you reinvesting? And what is the duration in that portfolio as well? David Turner : Yes, so our duration really can't change overtime. We are in 4 to 4.5 years in terms of duration what's rolling off is in the 250 range and what's going on is about in 315 range. So, that was one of the benefits of operations stay here that reinvest on the maturities again both in securities and loans is a big benefit to us. Gerard Cassidy : And then, circling back to deposits, one of your peer banks talked about they are seeing their commercial customers using their cash to -- for capital expenditures, which is one of the reasons they felt their commercial loan growth was a bit modest. Is there any evidence with your corporate and commercial loan book in talking to our customers that they are drawing down on their deposits for capital expenditures? And down the road you might see the loan growth as they use up those excess deposits? John Turner : Gerard, this is John. Yes, we think that is exactly the case and we would point to $500 million is more or less and deposits decline that we think have been directed related to the customers putting that to work It's sort of a -- that's a more specific number than it ought to be more of a round number I guess. But that kind of the runoff that we've seen has I think largely been we believe use our customers to invest in their businesses. And as a result at some point, we think that will translate into additional loan growth. Gerard Cassidy : And then lastly, David, you mentioned that you're outperforming on the beta. Have you guys figured out why the beta so far this year has just moved so slowly? Is it just the nominal rate of interest rates being so low or is there another factor? David Turner : Well, I think for us, if you look at our retail base betas of 1% gets back to the makeup of our deposit base and who customers are which was really the Chris' first question I was trying to answer. We go to the business side, we've had a cumulative beta of about 44%. Those are often times large corporate customers that are looking everything rates go up for their fair share, and I think that we have to be prepared for that just like we are on competitiveness from a loan pricing standpoint. But what differentiates us is our intent intense focus on relationship banking, whether it would be on the consumer side or to the businesses side or the wealth side. It's really important for us to maintain the relationship and have all the products and services delivered to our customers and we think that's what helps keeps our data down as well. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to John Turner for any closing remarks. John Turner : Just thank you all for participating today. Appreciate your time. Thanks for interest in Regions. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jennifer, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants' phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Jennifer. Welcome to Regions third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights about our financial performance, and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and earning supplement, are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call. With that, I will turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call today. Before we get started, I want to take a moment to speak about Hurricane Michael. As we've seen, this was an incredibly powerful storm and communities in the Florida Panhandle, South Alabama and South Georgia all faced different challenges as they began the recovery process. I'm extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of customers, fellow associates and the communities affected. As of today, all of our associates are safe and accounted for. All but five of our branches in the impacted areas are open and conducting business. And all our ATMs are now operating. We are working with our customers to determine their needs for assistance and have activated disaster recovery financial services, including ATM fee waivers and loan payment deferrals. I was in Panama City on Friday. And while the damage is significant, the markets are determined to come back strong. We're still evaluating the overall financial impact to Regions, but we do not expect it to be material. With respect to the third quarter, we are very pleased with our financial performance. We reported earnings from continuing operations of $354 million, reflecting an increase of 20% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Importantly, we grew loans, fees and households, and delivered positive operating leverage and significantly improved efficiency. Of note, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased again this quarter to its highest level in over a decade. It's important to point out that our results include the impact of a $60 million contribution to our Foundation during the quarter. Combined with the $40 million contribution we made in December of 2017, we've now invested $100 million, effectively positioning the Foundation to provide consistent and sustained investments in our communities for many years to come. Our third quarter performance clearly demonstrates our focus on continuous improvement is gaining traction. We remain committed to the successful execution of our Simplify and Grow strategic priority and investments in technology, process improvements and talent are paying off.  In terms of the economic backdrop, we remain encouraged by current conditions and customer sentiment. Increased lending activity coupled with substantial completion of portfolio recycling and reshaping efforts allowed us to deliver broad-based loan growth this quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, pipelines remain healthy and we're on track to achieve our low single-digit adjusted average loan growth for the year.  Let me quickly remind you the four key strengths we believe provide considerable momentum for Regions.  First is our asset sensitivity and funding advantage, driven by our low cost and loyal deposit base. This continues to provide significant franchise value and a competitive advantage, particularly in a rising rate environment. Second relates to asset quality. We believe the derisking and portfolio reshaping activities we have completed, combined with our sound risk management practices, have positioned us well for the next credit cycle. Third, our capital position supports credit growth and investments, as well as additional capital returns.  And, finally, we expect additional improvements in core performance through our Simplify and Grow strategic priority, which is well underway. Again, our goal is to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance and we believe our results this quarter provide tangible evidence that our focus on continuous improvement is working. With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave. David Turner : Thank you, John, and good morning. Let's begin on Slide 4 with average loans. Adjusted average loans increased almost 2% over the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth across consumer and business lending portfolios. New and renewed loan production remained solid, while previous headwinds associated with portfolio reshaping efforts subsided.  In addition, recently implemented process redesign and improvement efforts focused on accelerating commercial credit decisioning, also led to loan growth. All three businesses within our corporate banking group, which includes corporate, middle market commercial and real estate experienced loan growth across our geographic markets. Average loan growth was led by C&I across many sectors, particularly within our specialized lending and also within middle market commercial businesses. The investor real estate portfolio reversed trend and contributed modest average loan growth, driven primarily by growth in term real estate lending. Further, owner-occupied commercial real estate loans appeared to have reached an inflection point as average loan balances remained relatively stable in the quarter. Consumer lending produced consistent loan growth across most categories, led again this quarter by our point-of-sale partnerships as well as solid increases in residential mortgage and direct vehicle and consumer credit card lending. Let's move on to deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on growing low cost consumer and relationship-based business services deposits, while reducing certain higher cost retail brokered and trust collateralized sweep deposits. Total average deposits declined 1% compared to the second quarter and 3% compared to the prior year. The linked-quarter decline was primarily attributable to seasonal decreases, whereas a year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to strategic reductions as well as corporate customers continuing to use liquidity to pay down debt or invest in their businesses. Importantly, our teams continued to successfully grow net new consumer checking accounts, households, wealth relationships and corporate customers. For the full year, we continue to expect relatively stable average deposit balances, excluding retail brokered and wealth institutional services deposits. During the third quarter, interest bearing deposit costs increased 6 basis points and total deposit costs increased only 3 basis points. Cumulative deposit betas through the current rising rate cycle remained low at 15%. Year-to-date deposit betas were 23% and we anticipate modest increases in the fourth quarter. While we expect deposit betas to increase, we continue to believe our large retail deposit franchise differentiates us in the marketplace and positions us to maintain a lower deposit beta relative to peers. Now, let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income increased 2% over the prior quarter and net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.50%. Both net interest income and margin benefited from higher market interest rates, partially offset by increased wholesale funding, which included expense associated with debt issued during the quarter. Net interest income also benefited from higher average loan balances. Looking to the fourth quarter, recent loan growth, the high likelihood of another rate increase in December, and an expectation for a modest increase in deposit costs, should result in a continuation of recent growth trends in net interest income and a 3 to 5 basis point expansion of net interest margin, putting us solidly within our 5% to 6% NII growth expectations for the year. We also experienced a good quarter as it relates to fee revenue. Adjusted non-interest income increased 1% from the second quarter as increases in service charges, market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, and other non-interest income were partially offset by decreases in capital markets and mortgage income. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily attributable to a net $5 million increase in the value of certain equity investments, and a $2 million net gain on the sale of low income housing tax credit investments. Other non-interest income also benefited from a $4 million decrease in operating lease impairment charges. For of the full year, we continue to expect adjusted non-interest income growth between 4.5% to 5.5%. Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense decreased 3% compared to the second quarter. Most expense categories reflected a modest reduction in the quarter, with the primary contributors being a reduction in salaries and benefits, and lower expense associated with Visa Class B shares sold in the prior year. The adjusted efficiency ratio improved approximately 230 basis points this quarter to 58.1% and through the first nine months of 2018 is 59.7%, below our full year target. Also through the first nine months of 2018, we generated adjusted positive operating leverage of 3.4%. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted positive operating leverage of 3.5% to 4.5% and relatively stable adjusted expenses. The third quarter effective tax rate was 18.7%. It was favorably impacted by retrospective tax accounting method changes finalized in the quarter. Our full year effective tax rate expectation remains unchanged at approximately 21%. Let's shift to asset quality. Overall asset quality remained stable during the third quarter. Total non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased to 0.66% of loans outstanding, the lowest level in over 10 years and business services' classified loans decreased 7%. Business services' criticized loans as well as total troubled debt restructured and past due loans increased modestly. Net charge-offs increased 8 basis points to 0.40% of average loans. The provision for loan losses approximated net charge-offs and the resulting allowance totaled 1.03% of total loans and 156% of total non-accrual loans. While overall asset quality remains benign, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected.  Through the first nine months of 2018, net charge-offs totaled 38 basis points. With respect to the full year, we continue to expect net charge-offs to be towards the lower end of our 35 to 50 basis point range. So brief comments related to capital and liquidity. Through open market purchases and our previously disclosed accelerated share repurchase agreement, we've repurchased approximately 60 million shares of common stock during the third quarter. We also completed the sale of our Regions' insurance subsidiary. The resulting after-tax gain was $196 million and is reflected as a component of discontinued operations. Regarding 2018 expectations, our full year expectations, which we updated in mid-September, remain unchanged. They are summarized on the slide for your reference. So a quick summary. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Believe we are on track to achieve our 2018 expectations and have good momentum as we head into 2019 and beyond. With that, we're happy to take your questions, but do ask that you limit them to one primary and one follow-up question. We'll now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Just on the expense side, I wanted to talk little bit more about the efficiency ratio. I know you're currently in the 50 range and you're expecting below -- still below 60 for the full year of '18. When you look at '19, just given your expense efforts but also your -- some of the momentum you have in the top-line, where do you think that can go? And then longer term, do you think a mid-50s is still an appropriate goal beyond that? Thanks. David Turner : Hey, John. This is David. Yes, so we had a nice improvement on our efficiency ratio in the quarter. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio will improve throughout the year and into 2019. We had mentioned that we thought getting into the mid-50s was a reasonable goal for us over time, helped in part by our efficiency efforts, continuous improvement and lift in revenue from rates and the efforts we have to grow revenue through our investments. So, we still believe mid-50s at this point is a good target. Over time maybe we get below that. But we're going to update all of that for you in February typically. John Pancari : Okay. Alright. Thanks. And then, separately, on the loan growth side, I want to get a little bit more thoughts on -- a little bit more color on, where you're seeing the strongest demand? And we are hearing that a good number of the banks like pay downs are still relatively elevated and they are impacting their growth outlooks, while others are also flagging a competitive backdrop and lowering their guidance, given the competitive dynamics. It doesn't seem that you're seeing that in a profound way. And so, I wanted to get some of your -- some of the color you have around those factors? Thanks. John Turner : Yes. John, this is John. I would say, we continue to remain optimistic about our ability to deliver on our commitment to low single-digit loan growth on an adjusted basis. Loan growth was pretty broad-based, particularly within the wholesale business this quarter. So about -- if you adjust for the run-off and dealer indirect, about 1% growth in consumer and almost 2% in the wholesale book, we are not facing the headwinds that we had been facing that were the result primarily of our own derisking activities. So, we predicted that we would likely hit a bottom in investor real estate sometime in the second quarter. We did and we began to see a little pickup in activity there. And so, grew a little in the second quarter and that growth continued in the third quarter. Similarly, within our commercial banking activities and corporate banking, the growth has been broad-based across our specialized industry groups, our diversified industries teams, manufacturing, distribution and across our geographies. I would tell you that it is very competitive despite the fact that we grew, we passed on about half as much business as we actually produced and the reason we passed was primarily because of pricing or some other structural element. We didn't experience the paydowns in the third quarter that others have talked about, but we very much did in the first and second quarter of this year, and you might remember in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. So it is very competitive, compensation comes from a variety of sources. But we have really solid pipelines and I feel good about our ability to deliver on low single-digit adjusted loan growth for the year. John Pancari : Okay. And one more thing, could that low single-digits move up to the mid-single, as you think about '19? John Turner : We are still committed to low single-digit loan growth, John. We think it's important to be very disciplined, to be very prudent about what we booked, focus on client selectivity and risk-adjusted returns. We don't need a lot of loan growth to achieve our stated objectives. And so -- and we are going to be careful and thoughtful about what we book and so our targets are still low single-digit at this point. John Pancari : Got it. Alright. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor : You guys used a lot your 2018 CCAR approval buybacks this quarter, but your capital levels are still high and obviously the market is selling off overall here, including your stock. I'm just wondering about thoughts in terms of going back asking for more and how aggressive you could be on that front? David Turner : Yes, Matt. So we have our targeted capital range that we've spared before in common equity Tier 1 in that 9.5%. We've been working towards that. As you know, when you follow a CCAR plan that we did and receive an objection that had timing built into that as to when we would buy those shares back as well as have our dividend increased. So in order to change that, we would have to have a resubmission. We think we're on a good guide path right now, given where we are. We made a lot of progress this quarter, as you laid out. Our repurchase program will be completed in the fourth quarter and we can be in the market executing on our next quarter plan after earnings, so our share -- our accelerated share repurchase program I was referring to. Matthew O'Connor : Okay. When you say your repurchase program completed in 4Q you're talking about the ASR or you're \u2026.? David Turner : Yes. I want to clarify that, so the component part of the program, the piece of this accelerated share repurchase program will be completed in the fourth quarter. We have all our repurchases that are baked into our CCAR submission after that. Matthew O'Connor : Okay. And just to get thoughts on the 9.5% CET1 target, I suppose that was said maybe a couple of years ago and it seems like some of your peers have been guiding to, hopefully, getting into the call it 8% to 9% range. John Turner : Yes. Well, I think our peers are really all over the board. For us, it's incumbent upon us to keep the amount of capital we think we need to run our business and we will continue to update that each year, challenge ourselves, but we also have to be cognizant of where we are. We're nine years into an expansion. Next May it will be 10 years. And we think given our risk profile where we are and considering all other things at 9.5%, common equity Tier 1 is proper for us at this time. That being said, we'll be looking at that as we wrap up this year, then to the first quarter and we make any adjustments we deem appropriate at that time. Matthew O'Connor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Thank you. My first question is -- thank you for reminding us about your deposit base. And as we think about of further rate hikes from here, how should we think about the stickiness of your interest-free deposit balances? And I'm wondering if you could help us get a sense of the $35 billion in average interest-free deposit balance, how much of that would you call operational or part of checking accounts that are less vulnerable to mix shift? John Turner : Yes, Erika. I'll -- maybe I'll start. This is John. I would say to the question of how -- what percentage of our deposit balances we think are operational, 67% of all of our deposits are consumer deposits. We think approximately 93% of all of our consumer households maintain some sort of operating account balance with us. Obviously, on the wholesale side or corporate bank, all of those deposits, let's say in demand deposits, we think kind of as being operational. So I would believe that the vast majority of our demand deposits are in fact operational in nature. When we look at our consumer book, one of the things that gives us a lot of confidence about our deposit gathering franchise and the strength of our customer base is that over the last year we've actually grown consumer demand by over 5%. We've grown consumer savings by about 7.3% and grown NOW deposits by over 1%. So despite the fact that we've been aggressively managing our interest cost, the core of our business, which is consumer operating deposits, has continued to grow as has checking accounts through the last 12 months. David Turner : Erika, I'll add. The non-interest bearing from a corporate standpoint, as mentioned in the prepared comments, we did see companies utilize their excess liquidity to pay down debt, to make fixed capital investments, and in some cases, seek higher yields that we were willing to pay. And so, we are not losing the customer, they're just choosing to seek the highest return as you would expect all treasurers to do. So, we think we have the ability to really gather deposits. We're looking at loan growth. We want to pair that off and our commitment is to grow our deposit base, our core deposit base commensurate with our loans over time, you may have a mismatch in the given quarter, but we feel good about where we are in terms of deposit growth looking out -- looking forward. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just as a follow-up to John's line of questioning. John, I was interested in -- when you answered the question about the amount of business that you passed on over during the quarter and I'm wondering if you could give us a sense as it's much talked about this quarter on the level of non-bank competition that you are experiencing. And perhaps, David, if you could give us a sense of any residual exposure on balance sheet, your leverage lending or sponsor backed term facilities? David Turner : Yes. So we are seeing competition from non-banks in the real estate mortgage space or commercial real estate mortgage space, the life insurance companies, and commercial banking activities largely around M&A, sponsor-based transactions from business development corporations, private equity backed funds, and that is having some impact on our business. But as said by John, the impact was more significant in the first part of the year, particularly in quarter one and in parts of quarter two, particularly with respect to the commercial mortgage business. And on an ongoing basis we continue to see private equity backed funds take more risk in the leverage space than we're willing to take. And as a consequence, we would think that or suggest that our exposure to leveraged lending and to sponsor backed transactions is very reasonable at about 20% of our leverage exposure down from over 35% about a year ago. So, we've continued to reduce our exposure to sponsor-based leveraged loans and in part that's a function of risk selection and I think a part of reflection of just their activity in the marketplace. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The other consumer indirect bucket continues to be a helpful driver of growth. Can you maybe start just remind us what is in that and what's been driving the growth there? David Turner : Sure. So, we have indirect coming from a couple of different places. We have indirect auto and then we have indirect other, which is our point-of-sale initiative that we have with several entities. We continue to experience good growth there and good economics on that portfolio. We continue to challenge ourselves on that -- on all of our portfolios. The profitability on indirect auto has been challenged. We are a prime -- super prime book, and all the losses are improved. The economics there are -- have been challenging and we're continuing to look at that, yields are growing a bit for us there. So those are really the two kind of point-of-sale in indirect auto as two good categories Geoff. John Turner : Yes. I would just add. We got into that business to -- because we began to see consumer preferences develop and evolve. We wanted to learn largely what was going on in that space. We've established some internal concentration limits to manage our exposure to effectively consumer indirect, unsecured lending, I think it's to-date good for us. David suggested the credit quality has been good, returns have been good, and we've learned some things through observation and on the balance sheet a little bit. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. It looks like it's been a pretty important driver of the NII growth. On those concentration limits, how much are you willing to see the portfolio grow? John Turner : I don't recall that we have necessarily been public about the limits we've established, but we don't expect the portfolio to grow whole lot more than its current size. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question, just a follow-up on the liability side. David, you said you issued the debt this quarter and you had some ins and outs about deposits that led to a little bit more on the FHLBs, which might happen quarter-to-quarter. But I'm just wondering in terms of the structure of the liability side and the capital stack, where are you in terms of the efficiency on the right side of the balance sheet in terms of that mix of long-term debt? How much more you would be issuing naturally over time and whether preferred has become a more likelihood as that capital ratio grows into itself? Thanks. David Turner : Yes, Ken. So, we did -- that we are opportunistic with regards to our $1.5 billion that we raised recently, some in the holding company and some in the bank to take advantage of FDIC costs. As we look out at our plan for the holding company, we'll have another debt issuance in the holding company probably in the first quarter and that number will be in the $500 million range. But from a preferred standpoint, we have to -- there are a lot of moving targets in terms of preferred. We need to see what happens from a capital standpoint. We have a lot going on all the regulators and we need to see what happens with the buffer in terms of whether or not we need to issue and how much and when. So you need to stay tuned a little bit on the preferred offering in the -- which may or may not occur in the second half of the year if it occurs. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay. And then my follow-up is just on, coming back to the left side of the balance sheet and the mix of earning assets, you've kept the investment portfolio pretty stable here for a bit now, now that the loans have started to turn up, can you just talk about what you're doing in the investment portfolio? What your kind of front-book, back-book looks like and are you comfortable with the size of it at this point? David Turner : Well, let me talk more about the total left side of the balance sheet. So, our securities book, we feel good about where that is. Obviously, we want to comply with LCR, to the extent some of that gets changed regulatorily, maybe we can put certain of those investment securities in a little healthier return than some of the securities we have today, Ginnie Mae securities as an example. But in terms of front-book, back-book, we have about $14 billion of assets that are repricing over the next 12 months, that repricing of securities and loans, and that's a pickup of the 75 to 100 basis points even if rates don't move. If rates stay right where they are right now and that's a pretty good tailwind to us from an NII growth and resulting margin as well. We've been able to give you the confidence that we could hit our NII growth goals for this year and of course we'll update those for the next year later on, but that's important to note. Ken Usdin : Alright. Thanks a lot, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning, everybody. I could -- just on credit quality, it obviously 40 basis points, still very low. You did see a bit of an uptick, but still within sort of the guidance range. But any -- can you give us any color on the uptick and any areas of your portfolio you just feel may have more risk than others, just sort of a -- just a general view on where you think credit quality is heading? Barb Godin : Yes. Saul, it's Barb Godin. Relative to the uptick, it was related really to two credits, nothing systemic in the portfolio that we see, but two credits drove that uptick. And for the rest of the portfolio, it was well behaved, remained in good condition, moving on the right direction. And as we think about the future in terms of fourth quarter as well, we don't see anything major on the horizon, and again, feel good about our guidance of 35 to 50 basis points. And as you mentioned, 40 is still right there in the middle of our guidance. John Turner : I would just add. When you look at our overall credit metrics, we continue to see improvement in the level of classified assets, the level of non-performing loans, a little uptick in criticized loans this quarter. That to Barb's point does not reflect anything systemic at all and all the results reflect the outcome of the recent [stake exam]. Saul Martinez : Got it. If I could just sort of stay on the theme of credit quality, I know you guys have been critical on certain aspects of CECL, but where are you -- can you just give a sense where you are in terms of your preparation? When do you think -- assuming there are no fundamental changes to how CECL works, when do you think you'll have a rough estimate of what the financial impact could be? David Turner : Yes. Saul, this is David. So we've been -- we spend an awful lot of time and effort on our modeling and leveraging some of the CCAR models and building some new ones. We are in pretty good shape. We are clerking third-parties to make sure we do this right and we'll be running parallel, we'll start that in 2019, we'll adjust and learn, so that we're prepared for January 2020. As you know, there are discussions on CECL and whether or not there may or may not be modifications to the standard, whether or not there may be a delay or not, we'll just have to see, but it's incumbent upon us to be prepared either way. And as far as when we'll be prepared to give that guidance? We really -- before we do that, we want to make sure our models are reflective of our best numbers we can come out with. So it will be in the 2019, probably no earlier than the middle of the year and we'll just have to see how things develop before we can give you that kind of guidance. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Could we talk a little bit on the expense side, I know in the prepared remarks you've highlighted the operating leverage and the outlook. But maybe if you could give us a sense of the drivers and if this is going to be taking place in the near term due to Simplify and Grow or is this something that is a little bit longer-tailed with regard to acceleration in operating leverage? David Turner : Yes, Betsy. So there are several things working on operating leverage and efficiency, the revenue side and the expense side. Let me start with revenue. We continue to make investments to grow revenue, those investments are in people and in technology, making investments in higher growth markets for new branches, and we do pay for those investments and so we've been leveraging our continuous improvement process that we started out for Simplify and Grow. It's going to continue. This is something we want to culturally advantage. How do we get better each and every day through process improvement, leveraging technology? A big part of the expense side has been savings and the SMB line item that you saw this past quarter, which we told you about beginning of the year that you'd see the benefits of that in the third quarter, you'd see it again in the fourth quarter. We're substantially through with the larger numbers of headcount reductions. You'll see some, but not to the degree that you saw thus far through the nine months to September. And then from there we have to continue to become more efficient. And getting back to John's earlier comment on the efficiency ratio, where you think you can go? I just think our industry will continue to become more efficient leveraging all the new technologies that are out there to get efficiency ratio, which we think we could target in the mid-50s. We'll see if we can get better than that over time. But that's with a healthy revenue growth in making investments to grow our business are really important to us. Betsy Graseck : And then just on the NIM outlook, I know we talked through some of the drivers including securities book. Can you give us a sense as to how stickier you think are uplifts that you're looking for in 4Q, can persist going forward? David Turner : Well, our margin of 3.50% is better than most of our peers. And so, it gets harder as you have a -- if you continue to outperform, it gets harder to keep outperforming. That being said, we are leveraging what we see as our competitive deposit base, continuing to make investments to grow earning assets, in particular the loan portfolio as you saw this quarter. So leveraging off of that in the future growth that we see should help us and obviously we think December has a pretty high probability of a rate increase in that. And so, if LIBOR starts moving 30 days prior to December rate increase and you will see that benefit even more. Our beta has outperformed and we do expect our beta to get higher, to continue to increase the pace of which we'll see what happens. For the year, we're only at -- cycled to-date about 15%. So, we think that continues to increase, that is baked into our guidance already that we've given you and we think that that continues to help propel us to continue to grow NII in the fourth quarter and into 2019. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And LIBOR has actually widened a little bit recently, so maybe that's a tailwind into 4Q or are you already have that baked into your 4Q outlook? David Turner : We have that baked in already. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, David; and good morning, John. Can you guys share with us, when we go back and look at your numbers as well as your peers\u2019 for the last 20 years on non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits, the industry and yourself included has seen a significant increase in that percentage, in fact with you guys and post the merger of course, it looks like it's running around 19%, 20%, right around that time in '07, '08, now it's obviously in the mid-30s, so I think it was 38% this quarter. Is there something structurally different with the customers that they keep that -- that you're able to garner much more of your deposits and non-interest bearing? David Turner : So Gerard, we have really focused on continuing to grow customer accounts, demand deposit checking accounts, we've been very good at that. We've grown checking accounts this year, about 1.5%. And so, we think that that will continue. We expect that to continue. Our non-interest bearing demand deposits have also grown over time. We have seen that shrink as have all of our peers this past quarter. We performed a little better than most -- and again as because we see large companies putting that non-interest bearing to work either to pay down debt, make fixed capital investments or reinvest some higher earning securities. We do think that the non-interest bearing will be higher than history. We think as companies have gone through the liquidity scare that we had in a way that people are thinking differently about their liquidity. We think we'll see it for right, but we think people will hold on to more of that liquidity and leverage up versus using it all and then leverage it, at least that's our assumption, we'll see how that plays out. But I think it's going back to that liquidity scare in 2008. That's a little bit of a change in terms of how people think about it. John Turner : Yes. I'd agree with that Gerard. I'd also offer -- I mentioned 67% of our deposits are consumer deposits, 93% of our consumer households have a primary operating, what we would consider a quality primary operating account with us. The average balances in our deposit accounts are more granular we think than some of our peers. It reflects the markets that we're in, it reflects the type customers that we're banking and we think that that's a competitive advantage. It in fact does result in our maintaining more demand deposits, let's say, in the consumer space in some regard than we did before and it is a real strength of our franchise. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then on the other side of the balance sheet, you guys have been very frank and candid about what happens in the investor real estate portfolio post the financial crisis and the recession and you've been clear about winding down to a level that you're comfortable with, which seems as you pointed out the inflection point might be in this quarter. So as we move forward, what type of projects are you guys looking at on the investor real estate, whether it's the construction projects or the investor real estate mortgage area and I think John, you said you didn't really give any guidance on how big it allow different portfolios to grow to as a percentage of total portfolio. But in this one, I don't know if you'd be willing to disclose how big you would allow this one to grow to again as a percentage of the total portfolio? David Turner : Yeah. Today, it's in the 7 plus percent sort of range as a percentage of total and I think we'd expect it to stay there to grow potentially up modestly as a percentage of total. You might remember that, now going back almost three years, we committed to try and change the mix of business within investor real estate. In 2014, 85% of our production was construction primarily of multifamily and we began to work that level of production down. It had a significant impact on balances as you see and so our balances have significantly declined. We did reach a point in the second quarter when we began to -- I think it was in part because of seasoning, again to have the opportunity to win a few more commercial mortgage opportunities. And those are typically going to be financing season properties with stabilized cash flows largely on multi-family office projects. We have some retail exposure, but most of what we're doing is multi-family office and some industrial and with that comes full relationship. So we pickup deposit balances, we pickup opportunities to generate fee income through our capital market, secondary market offerings, placement products. And so, we think it's a business we want to grow sort of with the economy, maybe plus or little as it provides a lot of ancillary opportunities, but again it won't grow to be too much larger as a percentage of the total than it is today. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : Good morning. I just wanted to ask another question on expenses. You had a nice drop in expenses in the third quarter, do you think they could drop a little bit more in the fourth quarter given the full quarter benefit of the headcount reduction? And then looking at 2019, would you expect expenses to be kind of flat, maybe even down a little, just given a full year benefit of the lower headcount? David Turner : Yes, Peter. I think really focusing on improvements in the efficiency ratios and by the way to answer your question, we are making investments, as I mentioned earlier, to grow revenues, make investments in higher growth markets. We're trying to pay for that, keep our expenses relatively stable as we mentioned for the year, which means we have to have reductions in other places to pay for those investments. So, I -- we feel good about where we're going to end up for the year, fourth quarter already strong, and we'll now end up and update you on 2019, actually for the next three years, in February. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I will turn the call back over to John Turner for closing remarks. John Turner : Okay. Well, thank you very much. We appreciate everyone's participation, and thanks for your interest in Regions. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

I would like to remind everyone that all participants' phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Angie. Welcome to Regions\u2019 fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance, and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement, are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. We reported record full-year earnings from continuing operations of $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase of 28% compared to the prior year. Importantly, we grew loans, net interest income, noninterest income, and households. We delivered positive operating leverage and markedly improved efficiency. Of note, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased to its highest level in over a decade. David will cover the details in a moment. I'm very proud to announce we effectively achieved all of our 2018 targets, as well as our long-term targets laid out at Investor Day in 2015. We achieved these targets despite a market backdrop that was significantly different than we anticipated. It's important to note our financial accomplishments took place against a backdrop of substantial transformation for the Company. In 2018, we successfully navigated significant leadership changes and undertook one of the most significant organizational realignments in the Company's history. With most of the organizational changes behind us, we have intensified our focus on building a culture of continuous improvement, improvements which reflect our efforts to make banking easier for our customers and associates, accelerate revenue growth, and drive greater efficiency and effectiveness. These efforts include investments in technology where we've expanded the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As of year-end, we rolled out Zelle, giving our customers industry leading person-to-person payments capabilities. We also rolled out our new e-signature platform, completing our first end-to-end, fully digital consumer loan closings. With respect to markets, recent volatility has only heightened our focus on the fundamentals of our business and things that we can control, providing customers with quality advice, guidance and financial solutions, while maintaining appropriate risk-adjusted returns and unwavering credit discipline. On that note, recent credit quality continues to reflect a relatively strong economy and is performing within our stated risk appetite. Total non-performing, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans all continued to decline in the fourth quarter, while net charge-offs increased. The increase in net charge-offs is driven by higher consumer net charge-offs attributable to fourth quarter seasonality, continued normalization and an expected increase associated with growth in consumer indirect categories. As we talk to our customers, they feel good about their businesses and remain encouraged about their outlook for 2019. On the retail side, consumer sentiment is also positive as unemployment remains low and wages continue to increase. As we enter 2019 and our next three-year strategic plan period, our goal is to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance. We achieved meaningful progress over the past year as we worked to create a more efficient and effective organization. We have a variety of work streams still in progress and believe we're only beginning to realize the benefits that will ultimately be derived from our efforts. With that, I'll now turn it over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John, and good morning. Let's begin on slide three with average loans. Adjusted average loans increased 1% over the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth across consumer and business lending portfolios. On a full-year basis, adjusted average loan growth was 2%, in line with our expectations of low-single-digits. Once again, all three areas within our corporate banking group, which include large corporate, middle market commercial, and real estate, experience broad-based loan growth across our geographic markets. Total average loan growth was led by C&I where well-diversified growth was driven by our specialized lending, government and institutional businesses, and REIT lending portfolios. In addition, the investor real estate portfolio grew 3%, driven by growth in term real estate lending, primarily within the office and industrial property types. Average owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined modestly. There's been a lot of industry focus on leverage lending of late. We define leverage lending primarily as commitments exceeding $10 million where leverage as a multiple of EBITDA or cash flow exceeds 3 times for senior debt and 4 times for total debt. These credits are subject to enhanced underwriting and monetary standards. The portfolio is well-diversified and aligned to our specialized industry verticals with dedicated teams of bankers, underwriters, credit officers, and enterprise valuation specialists. During the fourth quarter, these outstanding balances declined modestly. With respect to consumer lending, loan growth remained consistent across most categories, led by indirect other consumer as well as increases in residential mortgage and consumer credit card lending. Consistent with forecasted GDP growth, we expect to grow full-year 2019 adjusted average loans in the low single digits. Let's move on to deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on growing low-cost consumer and relationship base business services deposits, while reducing certain higher costs retail brokered and trust collateralized sweep deposits. Total average deposits declined less than 1% compared to the third quarter. However, ending balances increased $1.2 billion or 1% as we've experienced success growing interest-bearing checking, money market and time deposit balances. Importantly, our bankers continue to grow new consumer households, wealth relationships, and corporate customers. On a full-year basis, average deposits, excluding retail brokered and wealth institutional services deposits, decreased less than 1%, in line with our expectation of relatively stable. Our large, stable deposit base continues to provide a significant funding advantage. Cumulative deposit betas through the current rising rate cycle remained low at 18%. Fourth quarter deposit betas increased modestly to 39%. This supports a low, cumulative overall funding beta of 22%. Our large retail deposit franchise differentiates us in the marketplace and positions us to maintain lower deposit and total funding costs relative to peers. So, let's see how this impacted our results. Net interest income increased 2% over the prior quarter and net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.55%. On a full-year basis, adjusted net interest income grew 5.4%, in line with our expectation of 5% to 6%. Both net interest income and margin benefited from higher market interest rates, partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest income also benefited from higher average loan balances. So, let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 7% from the third quarter. Service charges increased 3% and capital markets income increased 11%. The increase in capital markets income was primarily attributable to higher loan syndication income, fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and merger and acquisition advisory services, partially offset by lower customer swap income. Swap income declined approximately $6 million in the quarter, entirely due to negative market value adjustments at year-end. Offsetting these increases, market volatility in the fourth quarter also drove significant valuation declines in assets held for employee benefits, and negatively impacted bank-owned life insurance income. Revenue associated with market value adjustments on total employee benefit assets decreased $22 million, and bank-owned life insurance income decreased $6 million. Mortgage incomes decreased 6%, primarily due to seasonally lower production and sales revenue, partially offset by higher hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights and increased servicing income. Continuing with our strategy to leverage our mortgage servicing advantage and capacity, we completed the purchase of rights to service another $2.7 billion of residential mortgage loans during the fourth quarter. The decrease in the other noninterest income was primarily attributable to a net $3 million decline in the value of certain equity investments in the fourth quarter compared to a net $8 million increase in the third quarter. In addition, $4 million of third quarter leverage lease termination gains did not repeat. On a full-year basis, adjusted noninterest income grew 3.8%. Excluding the impact of fourth quarter market value declines on employee benefit assets, bank-owned life insurance and customer swaps, full-year adjusted noninterest income grew 5.2%, in line with our expectation of 4.5% to 5.5%. Let's take a look at expenses. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense decreased 1% compared to the third quarter. Excluding the impact of severance charges, salaries and benefits decreased 1%, reflecting the benefit of staffing reductions. This decrease was partially offset by one additional work day in the fourth quarter, and an increase in incentive-based compensation. Professional fees decreased 16%, attributable to lower legal expenses, and FDIC insurance assessments decreased 36%, reflecting the discontinuation of the FDIC surcharge. Partially offsetting these declines, occupancy expense increased 5%, attributable to storm-related charges associated with Hurricane Michael. On a full-year basis, adjusted noninterest expense increased less than 1%, in line with our expectation of relatively stable. Excluding the benefit from market value adjustments on employee benefit assets and the discontinuation of the FDIC surcharge, the increase in adjusted noninterest expense remains less than 1%. We achieved our efficiency target for the full-year adjusted ratio of 59.3%. The adjusted efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 58.1%, providing good momentum for 2019 and beyond. We expect full-year 2019 adjusted expenses to remain relatively stable with adjusted 2018 expenses. Additionally, we generated adjusted full-year positive operating leverage of 3.6%, in line with our expectation of 3.5% to 4.5%. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was approximately 17% and reflects favorable retrospective tax accounting method changes and adjustments for certain state tax matters. Full-year effective tax rate was approximately 20%, in line with our expectation of approximately 21%. We do expect the full-year 2019 effective tax rate to be in the 20% to 22% range. Let's move on to asset quality. As John noted, overall asset quality continues to perform in line with our expectations. Total non-performing loans excluding loans held for sale, decreased 0.60% of loans outstanding, the lowest level in over 10 years. Business serves as criticized and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 5% and 14%, respectively. Net charge-offs increased 6 basis points to 0.46% of average loans, driven primarily by seasonality within our consumer portfolios, normalization of consumer charge-offs and the growth in indirect consumer loans. The provision for loan losses approximated net charge-offs and the resulted allowance totaled 1.01% of total loans and 169% of total non-accrual loans. On a full-year basis, adjusted net charge-offs totaled 39 basis points, in line with our expectation of 35 to 50 basis points. Given where we are in the cycle and the continued normalization of certain credit metrics, we expect full-year 2019 net charge-offs to be in the 40 to 50 basis points range. Let me give you some comments on capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 22 million shares of common stock for total of $370 million and declared $144 million in dividends to common shareholders. On October the 24th, 2018, our accelerated share repurchase agreement transaction closed and final settlement resulted in an additional delivery of 8.75 million shares of common stock on October 29th. This brought the total shares repurchased under the ASR to 37.8 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 88%. And as of quarter-end, the Company remained fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule. Slide 11 reflects our 2018 performance against our targets and we've also provided you a select group of full-year 2019 expectations that were previously mentioned throughout the presentation. We will provide additional 2019 and long-term expectations at our Investor Day, next month. So, in summary, we're very pleased with our 2018 financial results, we generated record earnings grew loans, checking accounts, households, wealth relationships and corporate customers. We also generated almost 4% of adjusted positive operating leverage and improved our adjusted efficiency ratio by 210 basis points. As John mentioned, these accomplishments remained while our Company has undergone significant change, changes that have positioned us well for 2019 and beyond. With that, we're happy to take your questions. We do ask that you limit them to one primary and one follow-up question. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Steve on for Jennifer. John Turner : Hello, Steve. Unidentified Analyst : I just wanted to talk to you guys about your asset sensitivity. Any plans to hedge away any of this? It seems that that's going to be pausing, and then forward curve is actually looking for a decrease in 2020 right now. David Turner : Steve, it's David. We continue to look at our asset sensitivity and think about what the rate environment would be. We still are fairly asset sensitive of as little over $100 million over a 12-month period of time. We have put some hedges on, as we've discussed previous quarters that we have forward starting to help us manage what we think the rate environment might look like out a couple of years from here or year and change from here, such that we get to a point where we're getting more neutral at that time. We still think the Fed is going to be [data] [ph] dependent in terms of what they may do on raising rates in the short term. So, we think still be an asset sensitive at the moment is the right place for us to be. And so, we're gauging how much of that we want to take off in the future. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect, thanks. And then, as far as pay-downs in the fourth quarter, how do these compare to the first three quarters of 2018? John Turner : We didn\u2019t see nearly the pay-down activity that we experienced let's say in the first two quarters, which were the most active. I think it was more of a normal quarter, I would characterize it. Operator : And your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow-up on loan growth. We saw the loan growth pick up for the industry in the fourth quarter, number of banks have talked about that kind of accelerating. So, just kind of wondering, did you see this fourth quarter loan growth demand pick up? As you mentioned, the pay-downs were little bit better. And I guess, my follow-up, I'll ask that at the same time. What kind of pipeline momentum do you enter 2019 with? And could you see loan growth be a little stronger for Regions in \u201819 versus \u201818? What are the puts and takes that you have in particular as you look at \u201819? Thanks. John Turner : We ended the year with really very strong quarter, particularly in the wholesale side of the business. And as a result, you saw an increase in ending loan balances because quite a bit of the activity was toward the end of the year. The loan growth was really well-balanced as we referred to earlier, across most of our segments within industries. We grew our energy, our power and utilities groups, technology and defense, financial services, our government institutional banking group. So, a number of areas where we have specialized expertise across both our corporate and our commercial banking platforms grew during the quarter. Within real estate, we grew our term lending portfolio, which has now been an important strategic initiative of ours. We're beginning to see a much better balance between term lending production and construction originations. And within that category of term lending, we grew office and we grew industrial, broadly across our geographic footprint. So, it was a good quarter, production was up significantly over the prior quarters. As a result of that we ended the year where the pipeline is little softer than we began the fourth quarter with. We're guiding toward low single digit loan growth again, given that we'll have puts and takes within the portfolio. We continue to focus on portfolio optimization, on risk-adjusted returns and improving the quality of the portfolio. And so, we don't expect, John, to grow much more than GDP plus possibly a little. That's our plan. And if we do that, we can achieve all the financial objectives that we set out. Operator : And your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. I was just wondering on the service charges, you had real nice growth year-over-year. And remind us if you had any price increases or was the year-ago level depressed or anything? David Turner : Hey, Matt, it\u2019s David. No, really not price increases. Service charges have a tendency to follow our account growth, and our focus on growing core checking accounts has really been a hallmark of our franchise, and we continue to see that. And as a result, service charges have responded favorably. John Turner : Consumer checking growth now is up about 1.3%. And as David says, with that comes service charge activity, debit card usage, and other things, all of which have been very positive. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, just quickly on credit quality. The charge-offs did pick up a little bit. I think some of it was coming from home equity. Is there any noise from recent hurricanes that might be distorting that? John Turner : Let Barb answer that. Barb Godin : Yes. No, there's very little, if anything that came from the hurricanes this time which we were blessed on. The charge-offs that we saw, the increase between this quarter and last quarter quite frankly was expected, given the seasonality in the consumer portfolio, it reflects our focus in the past several quarters on some of the higher yielding products that we have in consumer. We\u2019re getting appropriately paid for the risk. So, again, we feel pretty good about the credit quality. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : I know you're going to provide us more detail in a month and a half or so at your Investor Day. But, I'm wondering as we think about our two-year earnings outlook for Regions, should we look forward to continued efficiency improvement? And can that efficiency improvement occur, even if the revenue environment becomes more challenging than budgeted? David Turner : Hey, Erika, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of managing our expense base as well as growing revenue evidenced through our Simplify and Grow continuous improvement process. That is a journey. It\u2019s not program where we continue to look at every aspect of our business in terms of how we can improve every single day. We have a number of projects on the table today that we will continue to benefit from. Clearly, our goal is to improve our efficiency ratio. We have talked about over time getting into the mid-50s. We\u2019re going to talk a little bit more about that at our Investor Day, as you mentioned. But clearly, there's aspects of revenue growth and expense management in that. As revenue becomes more challenged, we have to continue to look for ways to get to that efficiency ratio. We feel pretty confident we can get there. And so from a revenue standpoint, if it becomes more challenging, we'll do something else on the expense side. John Turner : Erika, this is John. I\u2019ll just reiterate that commitment to continually improving our efficiency ratio. We think it's fundamental to our long-term performance and to building a consistently performing sustainable bank and that's our intention. So, we are very committed to that. Erika Najarian : Thank you for that. And my follow-up question is, again, as the market seems to be pricing and set on hold for some time, how should we think about the margin trajectory for 2019 under that scenario? And also, how should we think about the delay in terms of repricing or how long do deposits reprice after the Fed pauses? David Turner : Yes. I think you will continue to see deposit costs increase, a little lag effect as things go through for the year. We think -- and for the quarter, this quarter coming up, we could be relatively stable, given everything that's going on. We do have tailwinds still from repricing a fixed rate assets, loans and securities that will be coming through this year, about $12 billion repricing. Those repricings benefit us in the call it, 30 to 50 basis-point range, maybe a little better today as we continue to see the 10-year move up a bit. So, from a pause standpoint, we still benefit from our -- what we believe is our competitive advantage, and that's our very-loyal customer deposit base, two-thirds of which is retail. And if you look at our deposit beta and our total funding beta continues to be below peers. So, we think that gives us an opportunity to continue to outperform through 2019 and beyond. Operator : And your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. John Turner : Good morning, Saul. We lost him. Saul Martinez : Can you hear me? John Turner : I can now. Yes, we can now. Saul Martinez : Sorry about that. I need to learn how to use this fancy technology called the telephone. So, I wanted to ask about fees. How do we think about what the right jump off point is for the fee line? Obviously, you had a lot of moving parts in there with market volatility, the $22 million that you called out, $3 million of equity investments. Is it as simple as just adding those back in, because you kind of have been in sort of that $500 million or $510 million run rate in recent quarters? I mean is that -- is it, should we just kind of add back those items and is that a reasonable way to think about looking on a go forward basis? John Turner : So, I do think those are things that added those back. We're trying to give you the information where you could do that. Our continued growth in NII -- I mean NIR will come through, if you just look at our core lines, our service charge line continuing to grow along with the account growth that we have. Card and ATM fee is the same way. We continue to grow cards and accounts, more transactions are moving to that mode of payments. So, interchange should continue to improve there as well. We made investments in wealth management this year in the form of hiring wealth advisors; we\u2019ll be doing that to help us grow there. Capital markets has been a good growth rate from us. There's volatility in that business from time-to-time. They finished up well. We talked earlier about that being $200 million business, and that's where we finished for the year. So, I look at capital markets continuing to add a little bit of growth opportunities. Mortgage is the one that's a little bit more of a challenge. We perform a tad better than others, because we're primarily a purchase shop versus a refi shop. Our production was down this quarter, but we are making investments there as well. Those investments are -- and mortgage loan originators that will strategically place and it marks as our footprint that we think can give us additional growth there. So, the market value adjustments happen from time-to-time. As you know, this fourth quarter was unusually noisy and we don't think recurs, at least to that extent going forward. Saul Martinez : Okay. So, other than the market value judgments, it's -- the equity impact, it's kind of steady as she goes, and seeing growth in your fee lines? John Turner : Yes. Saul Martinez : Yes. And on capital, you've obviously drawn, the CET1 down to 9.8%, you've guided to 9.5%. Is the idea still that you get to the 9.5% in 2019? And beyond that, I mean, how are you thinking about potentially maybe bringing that down further, obviously, with the regulatory backdrop NPR out there, is there scope to reduce your target CET1 beyond the 9.5%? David Turner : We set the 9.5%, based on how we view our risk profile, obviously, starting with a 4.5% minimal threshold and adding in buffers and then looking at our risk. And that's where the 9.5% is. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the regulatory regime and CCAR. So, hopefully, we get a little bit of relief to manage our capital little more freely than we have been, which we would see as a big plus, so that we can optimize our capital and keep our capital at that 9.5% level. I mean, mathematically, given our risk that we have today, we could operate a little less than that, but we are choosing not to do so. We think that's the best thing for us to give us a little bit of dry powder and be able to take advantage of opportunities to invest that in organic growth and just be prepared should anything happen. But, we think that 9.5% is also a capital level that allows us to provide appropriate risk-adjusted return to our shareholders in the form of return on average tangible common equity that they expect. And so, we don't see taking that down. Saul Martinez : Okay. And the buybacks in the first and second quarter obviously be lower, but like what's your projection when you kind of get to that 9.5% now? David Turner : Yes. It will be towards the middle of the year. And of course it's all dependent on what loan growth. So, we had pretty good loan growth in the fourth quarter that eased up a little bit in the capital. And at the rate that we're growing at, we could get there towards the middle of the year. Operator : And your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Turner : Good morning John. John Pancari : Good morning. I know you had indicated that the higher charge-offs in the quarter were at some of the normalization of consumer, indirect consumer charge-offs. And I wanted to see if you can give a little bit more color on what exact areas within consumer and indirect are you seeing at that normalization and what are your expectations in terms of how that -- those losses can trend through the year, particularly in consumer? Barb Godin : Yes. This is Barb Godin. The normalization that we're seeing is really across all products. Our residential mortgage is coming off some really low level, running 4 to 6 basis points of loss, which again is not normal. So, that will raise just a little bit. Home equity is doing very well. Home equity will move up just a little bit. Indirect auto has been behaving well for us. So, we see that holding pretty steady. Some of the third-party relationships that we have again they are performing as expected. So, where we see in the consumer portfolio overall, we do see things as being pretty straightforward. Our indirect balances have gone up, and that\u2019s created a little bit again in terms of a little more marginal off there. But, all-in, credit feels really good where we are right now in this cycle. John Pancari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, my second one is also on credit, two parts here. One, your delinquencies -- early stage delinquencies were up 21% this year -- this quarter. And some of that\u2019s consumer and I get it, but commercial was up. So, I wanted to get some color on what drove that. And then, separately, how are you thinking about the loan loss reserve overall here? You have bled it by about 2 basis points on a reserve to loan ratio this quarter. So, what's your outlook there for the year? Thanks. Barb Godin : Yes. Let me start with the allowance. You are right, it came in at 1.01%, which is down just a tad. A lot of that is due to loan growth. We think that allowance will probably hover right in that area, might go down to 1, but, I don't see it going sub-1 on the allowance. Relative to delinquencies, yes, we did move up just a tad. One of that was -- 30-day plus delinquency quite frankly was due to one large C&I credit that by the way repaid us immediately after, made payment immediately after the end of the month, especially given the holidays et cetera that caught us in the mail. So, that one\u2019s is cleared. So, again, on the delinquency front, we see those as being generally stable. And again, we look at the consumer book with the delinquencies, just go up a tad. Again, that\u2019s seasonality, we see that every fourth quarter. So, nothing there that we are concerned about. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, couple of questions. One, on deposit betas. I know you talked through how you\u2019ve -- it's been low relative to peers and also this quarter. Could you just give us a sense as to whether or not you think any of that was impacted by people moving from maybe market exposures to deposit exposures? Should we expect to see a little bit of a pickup in the first quarter? And if you could give us a sense as to whether or not there were some change in deposit betas on the corporate versus the consumer side this past quarter? David Turner : Yes. I think, Betsy, you should expect that deposit betas continue to move up. We\u2019ve continued to outperform. Our team looked at beta at 39, it\u2019s in pretty good shape -- or 39 this quarter, I'm sorry, cumulative up 22. So, I think that we -- and you're going to see that continue to trickle up a bit. Some of that will be due to mix change. As we think about corporate betas, corporate betas have moved up to about 81% from 72%. So, we continue to see that increase a bit, as expected. And that's really been baked into our margin guidance all along. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then, just separately, I know you talk through the 9.5% on the CET1. I guess, a couple of questions there. One, does it matter if you don't have to do the CCAR this year? Two, is there a triangulation that you're doing between CET1 and maybe other ratios like TC to TA, or other ratios that the rating agencies have out there that you're thinking about that ends up with what looks to me like it might be a little bit on the high end of the range relative to your competitors and relative to the risk in your own book? David Turner : Well we -- everybody has to run their capital ratios based on their own risk profiles or what they perceive to be the risk. We think common equity Tier 1 are most expensive form of capital. It behooves us to optimize all of our capital elements, but that one in particular, given how expensive it is. As we move down closer to that 9.5%, we are solving a portion of our Tier 1 with common equity. So, we will have to backfill the common equity piece for Tier 1 with preferred stock. We\u2019ve had that in our plan; we've talked about that before. That's something that'll happen most likely in the middle of the year. We're evaluating how much of that and when we want to put that on. So, there are a lot of moving parts there. But, you're exactly right. We're going to have to bolster Tier 1, one for regulatory purposes but also for rating agency purposes. And they know what our capital plan is and they know what our optimization plan looks like. Betsy Graseck : And then on stress test, if you don't have to do that this year, does that -- I guess that doesn\u2019t really matter. David Turner : No. We do our own stress test anyway. We will have to fill out all the forms that are associated with it. And it\u2019s maybe the year of the off cycle. But, we're really looking for and hope we get through the NPR and is released to manage our capital real time. So, we have espoused -- as an example, we\u2019ve espoused a 9.5% limit where we want to be on common equity Tier 1. If we could manage capital the way we want to, we would be there right now. We would have to wait for time because when we submit a capital plan, you have to execute if dividend changes and share repurchases along the timeline that you provide in your plan, which you filed a year before, and things change. As things change, we need to be able to maneuver our capital appropriately. So, hopefully, we'll get back, but we'll have to see. Betsy Graseck : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : I was wondering, the net interest income outlook for 20 19, is it fair to assume it should grow at a similar pace to the loan growth? David Turner : Given -- there a lot of other moving parts, but in general -- generally speaking, that's accurate. The balancing sheet growth is -- depending on what rates do, is going the bigger determinant of our growth in NII. We do think, as I mentioned earlier, we have a little bit of a tailwind with just asset reprice -- fixed rate assets repricing this year, $12 billion between securities and loans that we can pick up 30 to 50 basis points in NII as they come through the pipe. But yes, I think it's something important for us to get appropriate balance sheet growth to continue to grow NII at the pace we want. Peter Winter : Okay. And then, just a big picture question with expenses, you guys over the years have done a very good job holding expenses flat and still investing in the business for a number of years. If we look beyond 2019, is there still levers to pull on the expense side? Are you kind of close to exhausting those? John Turner : Peter, this is John. The whole purpose behind our Simplify and Grow initiative was the recognition. And at some point, we would quit benefiting from rising rates, we would quit benefiting from improving credit, and we would have to be operating more efficiently and effectively. We'd have to be operating in a way that it allows us to grow our business because we were easy to do business with. And so, our commitment to continuous improvement is based upon the belief that we can continue to find ways, be more efficient and effective to invest in our business, whether it's hiring more bankers, spending money on technology, building some branches in markets. We\u2019ve got to continue to grow our business through reinvestment which we largely want to pay for through our efforts to be more efficient and effective. Peter Winter : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners LLC. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, guys. I just wanted to ask, Barb, about CECL and sort of her thoughts on how this will play out the rest of the year, and to what extent you will disclose maybe in a couple of quarters how CECL looks for next year? Barb Godin : Yes. We're doing a lot of work on CECL as all of our peer banks. We are in great shape as far as I'm concerned, we're about to as start running parallel, the old process and the process. So not much to disclose there in terms of what the numbers look like, but again, feel good about the entire process, and we're going to be ready for it. John Turner : I think we're in really good shape. We've committed to our Board to report to them on a quarterly basis as to just how the parallel reporting manifests itself and what the impacts will be. And as Barb said, I think we're in really good shape and will become January 1, 2020. Christopher Marinac : Sounds good. Thank you very much. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : And your last question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : John, when you think about the risks to the Regions\u2019 earnings stream over the next year or two, aside from a recession, which we all know would bring on the credit provision risk, what do you worry about when you go home at night about your outlook for the Company going forward? John Turner : Well, obviously, first and foremost, we want to protect and continue to grow our core deposit base, and we think that's really the strength of our franchise. And I think we have demonstrated at least over the last 24 months or so the power of that deposit franchise, much of which wasn't being valued prior to rates beginning to rise. And so, that would be first and foremost. We've got to continue to grow our businesses and particularly those core businesses. So, demonstrating 1.3% or 4% consumer checking account growth, growth in consumer demand deposits, growth in consumer savings, really again core to our business and to what I think makes our franchise valuable and allows us to build that consistently performing and sustainable bank. And then, the other piece is credit. Are we focused on the credit risk appropriate in our business, are we managing concentrations, are we building diverse books of business, do we understand the risks and are we effectively managing those and reacting to emerging risks quickly and expeditiously and effectively? So, those are the things I think about when I think about what does it mean to be a good banker and how do you build consistently performing and sustainable bank. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and next question I guess is directed to Barb. Over the years, obviously you've had a good understanding of what the regulators are thinking about in terms of risks in the industries portfolio, as well as your own portfolio. We all remember in the 2015-2016 time period with energy credits. Can you share with us, when you talk to them today, what's their kind of focus in terms of worry on credit? And if you could also tie-in, I apologize if you've already addressed this, your leverage loan exposure and what you guys are doing in that area as well? Barb Godin : Yes. I think the regulators and us, are all in a good place, what's happening, as you know in the industry is, we're looking -- as we're looking at normalization, and where does that go to, and over what period of time. So, there's nothing in particular that they're really focused on, like us, we're focused on and you mentioned it, leverage loans. And let me just kind of comment on that in general. I know David already did but our primary definition for leverage loans in the Company consistent with the inter-agency guidelines from 2013, that's 3 times senior, 4 times total committed debt-to-EBITDA that may or may not be fully secured by margin collateral. Of course there's some different thresholds based on certain industries such as midstream wireless, towers et cetera. But, we don't exclude borrowers from the leverage designation based on credit quality, on borrower ownership for the purpose of the financing. And we make this leverage lending determination at the time of any credit events such as refinancing, renewal acquisition amendments all that. And as you know, I guess the difference is every institution has their own policy quite frankly on how they call a loan leveraged. And so, it\u2019s just a little difficult in terms of comparability. So, all-in, as I think about the leverage loan book, we feel very good about this book, it\u2019s got strong underwriting. We have a dedicated team, by the way, Gerard, that\u2019s focused on these deals. And on top of that, we stress test these loans to ensure that they're going to perform at a downturn economy. So, all-in, yes, leverage loans are right now on top of a lot of people's minds. But we feel again, really good about that because of really strong, good, well performing book. John Turner : Yes. I would just add, Gerard, diverse -- very diverse, it's been across a number of industry groups, largely aligned with our specialized industries, bankers and their expertise. About 27% is sponsor-owned, and that's down from the mid-30s. So, as we think about risk and managing risk in the business, we've been exiting some relationships that we think are the most risky parts of that portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : I guess I could sneak just one last question on leverage loans. One of your peers announced earnings this week and pointed out that they had pick-up in their criticized loans. And one of their individual credits was a borrower who are now in the non-bank market and obtained leverage loans, and it alarmed them, so they put -- they had a criticized loan. What techniques or what monitoring technology do you have or how do you figure out who of your good borrowers, who don't have leverage loans with you, but could actually go out and do something like that and then you guys have that indirect exposure? John Turner : We're actively servicing those credits on a quarterly basis, generally sometimes less frequently, sometimes more depending upon the risk and the particular credit relationships. And so, as the credit profile or risk profile changes, because the Company takes on additional debt or you're in the bank environment or non-bank environment, we would take that up as a risk factor and a consideration as how we think about the credit. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to John Turner for closing remarks. John Turner : Okay. Well that ends the call. Thank you all for your participation. Again, we are very pleased with our 2018 results. And I think we have a very solid plan for 2019 and look forward to seeing all of you, hope, at our Investor Day on February 27th. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement, are available under the investor relations section of our regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today\u2019s call. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying we are pleased with our first quarter results. The momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter has continued in the 2019. We reported earnings from continuing operations of $378 million delivering solid year-over-year revenue growth, broad-based loan growth and stable, but normalizing acid quality, all while reducing expenses and generating positive operating leverage. Loans grew somewhat faster than we anticipated in the quarter, driven in part by increased line utilization by our business customers. We intentionally funded a portion of this incremental loan growth with commercial and corporate treasury deposits and while this was more economical than also borrowings, deposit costs were impacted during the quarter. We expect loan growth will moderate through the remainder of the year, providing opportunities to optimize our deposit mix. With respect to the economy, we feel good about the health of the consumer and businesses. I\u2019ve traveled across our footprint in the last few weeks to markets including Tampa, West Palm Beach, Atlanta, Nashville, Houston, Greenville and Spartanburg, South Carolina and Mobile, Alabama. I\u2019ve met with clients of varying sizes and industries, and customer sentiment remains positive. Many customers experienced record revenues in 2018 and are expecting even better results in 2019. In general, our clients do not expect a recession in the near-term and neither do we. That being said, we remain focused on building a balance sheet that will position us for consistent and sustainable performance through all phases of the economic cycle. The outlook for the interest rate environment continues to evolve. clearly, the lower rates and the shape of the yield curve makes near-term revenue growth more challenging for the industry. However, as we did over the last four, five years, we will make the necessary changes and adapt to the evolving market conditions. In the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to focus on the things we can control, providing customers with the quality financial products and services they need, maintaining appropriate risk-adjusted returns, prudently managing our interest rate sensitivity profile, and effectively controlling expenses while continuing to make investments in technology and talent. Again, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. Our focus on continuous improvement remains key to our ability to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 3 with average loans and deposits. Adjusted average loans increased 2% over the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth and the business lending portfolio, and relatively stable balances across a consumer lending portfolio. Once again, all three areas within our corporate banking group experienced broad-based loan growth across industries and geographic markets. adjusted average business loan growth was led by a 4% increase in adjusted commercial and industrial loans, where growth was driven by our diversified specialized lending and REIT lending portfolios. Average investor real estate loans grew 8% in the first quarter, while average owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined 4%. both were impacted by a reclassification of approximately $345 million of senior assisted living balances from owner-occupied commercial real estate to investor real estate at the end of last year. Excluding the impact of this reclassification, average investor real estate loans increased approximately 3% driven by growth in term real estate lending, which is consistent with our strategic initiative to achieve better balance between term and construction lending. As John noted, a 160 basis point increase in line utilization also significantly contributed to this quarter\u2019s loan growth. With respect to consumer, adjusted average loans remained relatively stable as growth in indirect-other consumer and credit card portfolios was offset by a decline in home equity lending. Average mortgage loans remained relatively stable. However, the sale of $167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans late in the first quarter, will impact second quarter average balances. Despite solid growth this quarter, we continue to expect full year 2019 adjusted average loan growth in the low single digits. And with respect to deposits, we continue to execute a deliberate strategy focusing on growing low-cost consumer and relationship-based wealth and business services deposits. Total average deposits increased 1% during the quarter, reflecting 1% growth in consumer and 2% growth in corporate, partially offset by declines in wealth and other. Importantly, our bankers continuing to grow new consumer checking accounts and consumer households as well as corporate deposit accounts and total wealth relationships. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the composition of our deposit base. To protect our deposit advantage, we continue to execute strategies to ensure we are effectively serving our customers. These strategies facilitated growth in interest bearing checking, money market and time deposits at the end of last year, which contributed to total average deposit growth this quarter. Increasing deposit rates combined with overall deposit growth and portfolio remixing drove an increase in total deposit costs this quarter to 46 basis points. Despite the increase, we remain well-positioned relative to peers, further illustrating the significant funding advantage provided by our deposit base. Our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta increased to 25% this quarter. assuming no additional rate increases from the Federal Reserve, we expect a through the cycle deposit beta in the low 30% range. Retail deposits include consumer and private wealth deposits. Our cumulative retail interest bearing deposit beta increased to 10% this quarter, while our cumulative consumer deposit beta remained low at just 6%. As previously noted, a portion of this quarter\u2019s loan growth was funded with commercial deposits contributing to additional pressure on overall deposit costs. However, we remain committed to our long-term return targets and we will continue to optimize both sides of the balance sheet. So, let\u2019s look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income decreased 1% over the prior quarter and net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.53, both net interest income and margin benefited from higher market interest rates offset by higher funding cost, including the impact from our January parent company debt issuance. Net interest income also benefited from higher average loan balances, both negatively impacted by two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest margin, however benefited from fewer days, but was negatively impacted by average commercial loan growth. In the current interest rate environment, growth and net interest income and margin will be driven by balance sheet growth and business mix. With respect to net interest margin, rates consistent with the current yield curve and moderate balance sheet growth is expected to generate a relatively stable to modestly lower full-year margin, implying moderate margin compression for the rest of 2019. With that said, we continue to expect full-year adjusted revenue growth of 2% to 4%. With respect to fee revenue, adjusted non-interest income increased 4% this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Significant asset valuation declines in the fourth quarter associated with market volatility improved in the first quarter. Variable market value adjustments on total employee benefit assets increased $19 million while also contributing to an $11 million increase in bank-owned life insurance income. The increase in bank-owned life insurance also included the additional claims income compared to the prior quarter. As we look forward, we are taking actions to reduce future volatility associated with certain of these assets. Service charges and card and ATM fees declined 5% and 2% respectively reflecting seasonality and fewer days in the quarter. Capital markets income decreased 16% attributable to lower loan syndication income and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers, partially offset by an increase in merger and acquisition advisory services, and higher revenues associated with debt underwriting. As you know, capital markets income can be volatile for quarter to quarter. However, we do expect an increase in the second quarter. mortgage production and sales revenue increased compared to the prior quarter. However, total mortgage income decreased 10% primarily due to lower hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights. Other non-interest come includes an $8 million gain associated with a sale of $167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans late in the first quarter. In addition, fourth quarter other non-interest income included a net $3 million decline in the value of certain equity investments and a $5 million loss associated with impairment or disposal of lease assets. Let\u2019s move on to expenses, which we believe were well-controlled in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense increased 1% compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to a 2% increase in salaries and benefits reflecting higher payroll taxes as well as an increase in expense associated with Visa Class B shares sold in a prior year. Partially offsetting these increases, occupancy expense decreased 5% primarily due to fourth quarter\u2019s storm-related charges associated with Hurricane Michael. Furniture and equipment expense decreased 7% primarily due to a benefit in property taxes recorded during the quarter and professional fees decreased 26% driven primarily by a reduction in consulting fees. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.3% and the effective tax rate was approximately 21%. For the full year, we continue to expect relatively stable adjusted expenses and an effective tax rate between 20% and 22%. let\u2019s shift to asset quality. in line with our expectations, asset quality remained stable while continuing to normalize this quarter. Net charge-offs improved 8 basis points to 0.38% of our average loans. including the impact of loan growth, the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge-offs resulting in an allowance equal to 1.01% of total loans and 163% of total non-accrual loans. Total delinquent loans decreased $102 million as loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $106 million while loans 90 days or more past due increased modestly. total non-performing loans excluding loans held for sale increased 2 basis points to 0.62% of loans outstanding. business services criticized and troubled debt restructured loans increased $197 million and $27 million respectively. These results include the recently concluded Shared National Credit exam. While overall asset quality remains within our stated risk appetite, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected. We continue to expect full-year net charge-offs in the 40 to 50 basis point range. So, let me give you some brief comments related to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the company repurchased 12.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $190 million through open market purchases and declared $142 million in dividends to common shareholders. We continue to execute our 2018 capital plan that as you know, we\u2019re not required to participate in the 2019 CCAR process. However, we were required to provide our updated planned capital actions to the federal Reserve in early April. These planned capital actions, which remained subject to approval by our Board of Directors, provide a path for us to achieve our targeted 9.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio this year. At quarter-end, the loan deposit ratio remained unchanged at 88% and the company continued to be fully compliant with liquidity coverage ratio rule. Our full-year 2019 expectations provided at Investor Day remained unchanged and are summarized on this slide for your reference. So in summary, we are pleased with our first quarter financial results. Despite market uncertainties, we are focused on things we can control. We have a solid strategic plan and are committed to achieving our 2019 and long-term targets. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions, but do ask that you limit them to one primary and one follow-up question. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. John Turner : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. David, just on your comments about the outlook for the changing rate environment and the potential pressures that brings forth, can you talk through where that manifests itself the most? Is it the investment portfolio? is it loan spreads? And if you could go back a little bit further into that ability to kind of remix those deposits as you move through the year? Thanks. David Turner : Sure, Ken. So yes, we\u2019ve looked at the rate environment clearly changed, since going into the year, not anything different than we\u2019ve experienced before as we showed you at Investor Day. We had a three-year outlook, if rates were lower than we thought and we adapted and overcame that and we\u2019ll do it again this time. As we think about rates, from a reinvestment standpoint, we still have a front book, back book benefit, is not as much as it was originally. But we still benefit from that. In this particular quarter, we had a couple of things that impacted us. We had loan growth that was a little stronger than we had anticipated with 160 basis point increase in line utilization. We had to fund that and we chose to fund that with higher cost deposits versus going to the wholesale market. So, if you look at deposit betas, that caused our deposit base to be up. our overall funding beta is kind of in line with peers. But we thought that was the right thing to do. The loans that we put on were a little center spread, which puts a little pressure on our margin. The margin actually was impacted by our parent company Danish once we had in the first quarter, as well as a reclassification of purchasing card assets that don\u2019t carry any interest carry. those two things were two basis points of margin in the quarter. So, as we look forward, what we need to do is continue to remix the balance sheet both on the loan side and the deposit side as we seek to optimize both levels to get our net interest income, where we want being in the resulting margin. I will go ahead and answer the question, because it\u2019s probably coming up that our margin expectation for the year, we believe to be a commensurate with what we had last year in the 3.50 range, give or take a point or two. So, that\u2019s kind of how we see the rates and our expectations for the year. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. And then one follow-up on the loans. You\u2019ve reiterated that with a good start to the loan growth, the adjusted loan growth. Can you give us an idea of just the summary of the non-core, the combination of the auto stuff and then the new ones you sold than what you expect that would be on the full year? Thanks, David. David Turner : Yes. So we\u2019re still guiding on the adjusted loans with cards out the runoff portfolios to be in the low single digits. You\u2019ll see some of the remixing there. A little bit of that growth that you saw in the first quarter where companies that have access to the capital markets that chose to come to the bank market, because it\u2019s cheaper. We expect that to change over time and so you should expect some runoff there. And we\u2019ll refill that still to get our low single digit \u2013 low single-digit growth. The auto book continues to run down. We\u2019ll be in the $700 million, $800 million range on those runoff portfolios. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. John Turner : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Yes. Good morning. John, on that point, on the deposit and margin commentary there, given the loan growth you saw on the quarter, you said it came in a little bit better, why did you make the decision to fund that growth with higher cost funding versus a deposit? John Turner : What we \u2013 what I said was we chose to have \u2013 fund that with higher cost deposits versus wholesale funding, because the deposit growth was cheaper than what funding was. What I was trying to address is the deposit beta was negatively impacted, because of that decision. If you look at our total funding beta, our total funding beta was fairly consistent with the peers. So, it\u2019s just a mix of what we chose to fund that growth with versus what somebody else might have done. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. And I misunderstood that. I just wanted to get clarity on that, okay. And then separately, around the loan growth expectation for the year and that you expect it to slow from here; could you just talk about some of the give and takes, what you think will drive to the net moderation off of this level versus any incremental, strengthening on the commercial side for example. David Turner : Yes. So, as John mentioned in his comments, we feel good about \u2013 our customers feel good about the economy and they\u2019re continuing to borrow. We had and that increase we saw part of that this first quarter. Again, we\u2019re \u2013 customers we believe have access, we know have access to the capital markets that chose to use their bank lines of credit to give them more flexibility in terms of timing on when they would go to the capital market system. It\u2019s just a matter of time before that happens. So, we\u2019re going to see those loans run out of the bank as we continue to grow consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. So, when you get net-net to the end of the year, we think net loan growth is still on that single, the low single digits. John Pancari : Okay. thanks, David. And one last thing on credit, could you just give us a bit of color about around the drivers of the higher classified in special mentioned loans. And then I guess your thought around the longer-term loan loss reserve level of here. I know it stands around 1.01%, I wanted to get your thoughts on where that could trend to? Barb Godin : Certainly, John. It\u2019s Barb Godin. relative to criticized and classified in terms of those numbers, that\u2019s attributable to really two or three credits that moved over, and given the lows that were on, it\u2019s simply starting to slowly normalize. Also recall that our results include the results of the recently completed Shared National Credits survey or credit exam. So that\u2019s all encompassing. We don\u2019t see any trends in there that we\u2019re looking at that concern us at all at this point. And in terms of our loan loss reserve, we\u2019re sitting at one-on-one; we think that area 1% one-on-one is probably the right number as we look forward as well until we get the seasonal next year. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you, Barb. David Turner : Yes. John, I would just reiterate that I think we still feel very good about our credit metrics. As Barb said, we\u2019re really a better than 10 year lows in terms of criticized, classified, non-performing loans. And so from time to time, we\u2019re going to see a little movement up or down I think in those metrics in this particular quarter, as Barb mentioned, we had one or two credits and impacted both criticized loans and non-performing loans. And so given the low base we\u2019re coming off, I think you\u2019re going to see some back and forth there, over the coming quarters as credit begins to normalize a bit, but we feel still feel very good about our credit quality. John Pancari : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. David Turner : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I just had a question on your capital target. I know you mentioned that with the expectation that you have for buybacks this coming year, you should be able to get to 9.5% target seats you won. I\u2019m just wondering if given the proposal the Fed has for, its NPR that\u2019s outstanding out there for banks to your side, would you be at all rethinking the target seats you won at any point or is that something that you think you need to have it as high as 9.5% going forward? David Turner : Yes, Betsy. We had mentioned at Investor Day that mathematically, our capital that we think we need based on the risk profile that we have, would lead one to a common equity Tier 1 of 9%. And we said to our \u2013 those attending and listen that we added another 50 basis points of cushion on that. We believe that that capital level one provides the proper capital we need to have plus a little bit. Wow, allowing us to get to our return expectations that we also laid out, so that those targets were not derived based on supervisory input or CCAR mechanism. So, I don\u2019t see that changing at all. As you know, we have to get through the second quarter, which is based on last year submission. And then the third quarter, we\u2019ll start \u2013 we\u2019re not under CECL, but it\u2019ll start our capital planning and that\u2019s why we have confidence. We will get to our 9.5% by then. And we\u2019ll have \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to toggle between loan growth and share buybacks as we seek to manage the capital at that level. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Since the teams are very \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of cushion in there. So, I\u2019m wondering, maybe it reflects the view that you feel your portfolio might be a little more risky than peers or you\u2019re just superconservative. David Turner : Well, as I mentioned our math, based on our risk profile would lead you to 9. We choose to have an extra 50 basis points in there, which we think gives us flexibility, especially as you think about, where we are in a 10 year run. And if the county were turned down, we have the ability to perhaps take advantage of some opportunities that might come our way to invest in the assets. they could give us growth. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we think inappropriate amount of cushion, because it didn\u2019t weigh us down from our return objectives and gives us that flexibility. So that\u2019s why we do it. Betsy Graseck : Yes, I got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. David Turner : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the comments on capital actions. So, if we filled in the template that the Fed distributed or getting to about a max preapproved capital action of about 2.15 billion for 3Q 2019 to 2Q 2020. And I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s a ballpark with how your team calculated the template? David Turner : Well, I think, again, the way we want you to get there is by looking at our target of common equity tier 1 of 9.5%. We think that the toggle we have to think through on buyback is what\u2019s loan growth going to look like. Now we\u2019ve said we wanted to pay out a dividend in the 35% to 45% of a range that uses a piece of it of earnings. and then the rest of it is either going to be used for loan growth or it\u2019s going for the most part or we\u2019re going to buy shares back. So, trying to now stipulate exactly what the buybacks going to be is when we don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary as much because we\u2019re giving you what the end result\u2019s going to be. So you have to \u2013 you have to come up with your expectation of what our loan growth is going to be and it\u2019ll help you get your buyback number. Erika Najarian : I met all-in. Okay. And just taking a step back, you unveiled a mid-term efficiency ratio of 55% or below during your Investor Day. And of course, the curve dynamics have gotten less friendly since, I\u2019m wondering, as we think through the next few years, is there that much expense leverage left, to be able to get you to this target of less than 55% by 2021. Would this type of curve backdrop or are we underestimating some of the investments that you\u2019re making that could boost revenue beyond rates beyond 2019? David Turner : Yes, Erika. I would say it\u2019s combination of both. First of all, we\u2019re committed to the 55% efficiency ratio by the end of 2021 and we believe we have appropriate levers both in terms of revenue growth from investments we\u2019re making and opportunities to reduce expenses to be reinvested in additional initiatives that will help generate revenue growth to get to the 55% efficiency ratio. We\u2019re absolutely committed to get there. Erika Najarian : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. David Turner : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi. I\u2019m wondering where do market rates have to go to fly it out than them. obviously, you\u2019re guiding to flattish to them on a full-year basis, but trickling down from the 1Q level. And then just conceptually, and I realized that 10 year is not the only right that matters, but what\u2019s kind of the break-even point on the 10 year, where it does fly now that this kind of 3.53 that this is trickled down? David Turner : Well, if you just think about the 10 year just on reinvestment that security\u2019s book. So, we\u2019re coming off a 2.70-ish range, reinvesting in the 2.90, the 3% range. So, we\u2019re getting some lift, just reinvesting those cash flows over the near-term. It\u2019s really not curved dynamics as much that drives versus the mix of what we put on both on the right and the left side of the balance sheet. So, I think you could have \u2013 you could be where rates are in the curve can look, where it is now and depending on what your choices are would depend on whether or not you can continue to grow an NII resulting margin or whether it stays flat. We\u2019re looking to optimize our balance sheet for not only NIM, but net interest income growth, return, credit risk management, all that has to work together. And again, we\u2019ve laid out our three-year expectations and our one-year expectation and we intend to kid all of that. So, there are a lot of moving parts that you have to deal with. And it\u2019s that\u2019s a hard one to explain. Matt O'Connor: Okay. No, I understand. I think what\u2019s changed versus a few months ago is the rate environment versus I think your strategy, so \u2013 and obviously, rates, they move around and we\u2019re up to 20 bps off the bottom and maybe, two months from now, we\u2019ll be 20 bps higher and we\u2019re up about\u2026 David Turner : Yes, Matt. I\u2019d add, our expectation for that rates were going to go down at some point, which is why we began our hedging program over a year ago. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re about 70 \u2013 we\u2019re about 75% through our hedging program right now. And we did that in large part with forward starting swaps to begin in 2020 as we expected GDP to decline to 2.5% in 2019, 2% in 2020 and 1% in 2021. And that the probability of rate cuts would increase in 2020 and 2021 and we wanted to be protected there. What you\u2019re seeing of late as a reversal from the Fed? And it put more pressure on not getting, not only not getting an increase this year, but having some probability of a cut this year, which we don\u2019t think will happen by the way. And so that that\u2019s really, where we\u2019re more exposed as if there were cut right now. Again, we\u2019ll take that risk, because we don\u2019t believe that\u2019ll happen. John Turner : The other point, I guess I make just if I might on, a balance sheet optimization is we\u2019ve indicated we think that loan growth will begin to moderate a bit. At the same time, our core deposit base continues to grow very consistently. Consumer demand deposits grew over 4% last year. They\u2019re growing for the seventh year in a row point to point up about 7%. We see growth in consumer savings, consumer checking continues to grow. And so that\u2019s a more consistent to lever an increase in deposits that will occur over time and as that catches up with loan growth, which will be moderating. We have an opportunity to also optimize our deposit base and we think that will accrue to our benefit. Matt O'Connor: Okay. I guess the optimization and the mix that you\u2019re talking about, I thought it would have been beneficial from them. John Turner : Yes. Matt O'Connor: Okay. But the combination of that and where we are in rates still causes it\u2019s trickled down a little bit. David Turner : Well, I think you can ask some noise in the interim. Again, we\u2019re at 3.53, we said we\u2019d be at 3.50 for the year give or take a foreigner too. And it\u2019s going to be dependent on how well we optimize and the 10 year has moved quite rapidly, it\u2019s gone from 3.50 to almost 3.60. We\u2019re down a little bit this morning. So, if we continued \u2013 the 10 year continues to move up a little bit, then the reinvestment helps us to increase, net interest income and helps us from a margin standpoint. Matt O'Connor: Got it. And then if you don\u2019t mind, I just want to squeeze in the line utilization increase of 160 basis point, was that concentrated in like a handful of credit and if not, I guess what makes you think it\u2019s going to decline so much to if you don\u2019t meaningfully slow the loan growth? It was so good this quarter. Thank you. David Turner : Yes, Matt. I\u2019ll ask Ronnie Smith, who heads our Corporate Bank to answer the question. Ron? Ronald Smith : Yes, Matt. It was very broad-based. It was not in a handful of clients and really focused in on most of our higher quality clients that I think David mentioned earlier that have access to other markets and we\u2019re anticipating that we\u2019ll see changes with those advance rates as we go forward, but very broad-based across the industries and within geographies as well. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. David Turner : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. And hi, good morning. Question on credit, Barb. Two questions. First of all, I assume you\u2019re running parallel right now. I\u2019m wondering if you have any preliminary estimates on what the day one impact will be for CECL. And my second question is on your criticized leverage loans that slide was very helpful in the deck. Is there any industry concentration within those criticized leverage credits? That\u2019s it. Barb Godin : First question on CECL is, yes, we are in the midst of doing a lot of work, running parallel, making sure our models are operating the way they need to et cetera. We\u2019ll probably disclose something in the second quarter, but we\u2019re not quite ready to do that yet on the CECL front. Relative to the leverage loans et cetera, there\u2019s nothing that sticks out in terms of anything that\u2019s an anomaly. So, a pretty good book. David Turner : Just for clarification, I think in our second quarter release, probably we\u2019ll provide some information on the third quarter \u2013 third quarter release, day one impact. So, we\u2019re still a ways off. John Turner : It\u2019ll be in the third quarter release something. Yes. We want to run parallel for a couple of quarters to see what it looks like. Jennifer Demba : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. David Turner : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : David, I wanted to \u2013 hey, good morning. I\u2019d talk to you a little bit about NII versus net interest margin. When you had a little bit of extra loan growth this quarter and then you went out and funded it, I mean you literally could have funded it through the securities portfolio, which would have increased your NIM, just by substituting higher rate assets, loans being investment securities. So, I think the temporary nature of what you did or thought your loan growth is going to have and the sense of the run up, it\u2019s going to come back down. You just went out and funded it, which incrementally caused some pressure on your net interest margin. And if you look at NII is still growing relatively nice year-over-year, but you have the day count in the first quarter. So, it just seems like to me the margin this quarter was exacerbated just given all in the incremental funding of the balance sheet. David Turner : Yes, Marty. So, the NIM to us is the result of all things that we do. And you\u2019re exactly right, but we put on, we want to be fixated at our NIM and then we could have done different things. I do want to make sure if I caught the fact that our NIM was impacted 1 basis point by our parent company issuance. And then we had the reclassification of our purchasing card into loans, which is a non-interest bearing asset. So that weighted us down another point. So, we could have kept the margin relatively stable at 3.55, but we were able to keep NII level, not withstanding two days, which caused us $10 million in the quarter. So, we thought it was pretty good. Again, we\u2019ll optimize the balance sheet and those loans that we did put certain of those loans we put on had thinner spreads to them. They\u2019ll run out to the capital markets, we\u2019ll get a capital market fee when that happens, we\u2019ll remix the balance sheet and we\u2019ll be off to the races. So, we\u2019re not overly fixated on the margin. Marty Mosby : Well that\u2019s what I thought. And then when you thought, you talked about a deposit betas and you said that through the cycle or the key motivator right now is about 25% and you said by the time we\u2019re done, we\u2019re going to be at 30%. now that would, in general assume that you had further rate hikes that then we\u2019re going to push deposit rates up. But if we kind of stabilize here and rates don\u2019t go up anymore, let\u2019s just assume that they don\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t deposit pricing, maybe with a little bit, till increase in the second quarter began to kind of flatten out. So, I just want to make sure we\u2019re being consistent with that. How much of the excess you expected in deposit pricing going forward? David Turner : Yes. So, what our history tells us is that it takes about 12 months and change after the last Fed hike for deposit rates to stop moving. So that\u2019s a piece of this that\u2019s usually just even if we don\u2019t get another increase, you\u2019ll see that continuing to come through. Mix has a big deal to do with it too. So as we continue to grow low-cost core checking accounts and interest freak accounts, that\u2019s helpful. but our commercial customers want to, they\u2019re trying to take their excess cash and get the best yield that they can. If rates stop moving, that will abate to. So moving up into the 30s, we can argue, where in the 30s, we might end up. The point is we\u2019re going to continue to see some costs, some funding costs, increases continuing to come through that we need to deal with. And we have a little bit of the headwind on reinvestment on the left side of the balance sheet. And then the optimizations really will carry the day for us. Marty Mosby : And then I guess the thing that I would suggest or highlight is that this deposit beta market has not been like any historical period we\u2019ve seen in the past. It\u2019s been a lot different and it\u2019s actually reacted much better than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. So, why shouldn\u2019t we expect that maybe we could see this thing slowed down or actually begin to flatten out a lot quicker given that the deposit beta has been better than what we\u2019ve seen in the past cycles? David Turner : Well, you\u2019re certainly correct that is different. Betas last time were in the 60 range and now we\u2019re talking in the 30 range. And part of that is because of how slow the recovery has been and the pace of those increases. Also coming off historic lows and so I think all that matters and there is a chance that things flatten out quicker than we have anticipated. if that happens, then we\u2019re going to be better off than we think. And we\u2019d much rather give you a number that we \u2013 that we can hit versus trying to promise something that will struggle achieving. Marty Mosby : And then just last question, the swaps next year, is there any net increase in earnings from the spread lock, enough freights were flat given the fixed rate that you locked in? Is there a \u2013 there should be a little bit of a positive spread. So, I was just curious if there\u2019s some upcoming income that you\u2019re going to get out of those swaps once they actually hit the four dates. And when does that actually happen? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So, the forward dates are in 20 and you\u2019re right, we would have some positive carry there, but we \u2013 we also entered into some interest rate floors, where you had to pay a premium and you amortize the premium. So, the amortization unfortunately offsets the swap benefit. So, again, if rates didn\u2019t move from here, we kind of pushed there. So, you won\u2019t see any real positive carry. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : Hey, good morning everyone. David Turner : Good morning. Stephen Scouten : I\u2019m curious, just digging down in the name a little bit further, obviously Investor Day, you laid out this range of 3.40 to 3.70 and by the commentary from you, David, that \u2013 we might get to 3.50 for the year implies that the NIM will move into high 3.40s by year-end. So, can you talk to me a little bit about how that lower end, even on a zero policy range scenario would only get down to 3.40 and maybe what\u2019s \u2013 what dynamics have changed since 2016 when we were at 3.15, 3.16 that sort of range? David Turner : Yes. So part of which \u2013 what we want to do is try to frame up the range at Investor Day like we did. And what changed since then was the near-term risk before our forward starting swaps began in 2020. So even if you saw a dip in 2019, we actually start recovering that in 2020 when our derivatives kick in. So that\u2019s the piece that gives us confidence that we\u2019re still within the range that we told you back then. If we received a rank cut in 2019, that would \u2013 we\u2019d have a different ballgame. We\u2019d be telling you something different. We just don\u2019t think the probability is very high than that happens. So, anyway, that\u2019s\u2026 Stephen Scouten : Yes. That\u2019s a perfect answer. Thank you. And the swaps are really what prevents you from getting down into those levels we saw back in 2016, even if we were to revert back to a similar rate environment. David Turner : That\u2019s exactly right. Stephen Scouten : Okay. And then just lastly on the security\u2019s book, is there any chance that you guys look to reduce that as a percentage of average earning assets to fund some of the growth or is that kind of 22% range, where you\u2019d like to stay? David Turner : I think there, we have a little bit in there that\u2019s helping part of our hedging program right now that works against us again on our margin. It\u2019s not a tremendously large number. We kind of like, where we are from that standpoint. I think what you should expect over time as a remixing of our security\u2019s book, kind of today, we still have treasuries and Ginnie Maes in there that we used for LCR purposes. And to the extent that that changes, then maybe we can put those, working a little more effectively force into mortgage backs. So, you\u2019ll see us do that from time to time. As a matter of fact, you saw us take security loss as of this quarter to pair off with a gain that we had on selling the affordable mortgage loans. So that we could get better carry going forward and we\u2019ll pay for that in less than a year. So, those are the kinds of things you should expect us to do over time. Stephen Scouten : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey guys. A quick \u2013 I just wanted to follow up on the line of questioning on the deposit betas and actually, just wanted to make sure I understand the math kind, what you guys are saying, So, the 25% \u2013 the 25% through the cycle Beta thus far basically implies that your deposit costs have moved up in the neighborhood of about 55 basis points given where the Fed funds is that right now. if I assume no further hikes and you get to the low 30s, that implies an additional 15 to 20 basis points of deposit cost pressure over the next 12 months. Is my math more or less, right? Is that what you\u2019re kind of baking into that at assumption? David Turner : Yes. I think you\u2019re close \u2013 just probably closer to 10. But we\u2019re at 46 basis points of costs, one of the lowest. So, when you start looking at beta and percentages, you get, you can get some odd numbers, but we feel, we feel like, again, back to, I think as Marty asked a question if we miss it, we\u2019re going to outperform what we\u2019re telling you. Saul Martinez : It\u2019s closer. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s closer to 10 basis points is what you\u2019re kind of baking in, in terms of incremental deposit cost pressure without any further hikes? David Turner : That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Saul Martinez : Is that on total deposit or interest bearing? David Turner : Those are really more interest bearing. Saul Martinez : Interest bearing. Okay. Want to make sure I got that math. And then I guess on the \u2013 just a broader question, the 2% to 4% revenue, I say, you\u2019ve talked about NIMs and NIM was sort of stabilizing at 3% to 5% for the full year \u2013 of being at 3% to 5% for the full year, but in the 2% to 4% revenue growth, how do we think about that in terms of NII growth versus fee growth? David Turner : We kind of put those together, Saul at this time, because there \u2013 obviously, there\u2019s challenges in terms of managing earning assets in the mix and all that. So, we put that together with NIR, we\u2019re still convicted that will be within 2% to 4%. Right now, there is more pressure on the NII component of that, but not enough that would cause us to not meet that, that goal that we had. Saul Martinez : Okay. Right. Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good afternoon. How are you, John and David? David Turner : Hey, Gerard. Fine. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys give us a little further color on the portfolio of the breakout that you showed on leverage loans and then the Shared National Credits; are you comfortable with these levels or we\u2019re talking a year from now these numbers going to be much different than they are today? John Turner : No, I don\u2019t think so, Gerard, and not let maybe far, speak as well, but I think we\u2019ve established some internal limits, just as we have concentration limits for lots of other aspects of do we manage risk in our portfolio and we\u2019re at a level with respect to leverage lending that we\u2019re comfortable with. We expect to continue to manage to about the level that we\u2019re at. I think the most risky exposure we\u2019ve talked about before in the portfolio has been loans to sponsor own companies. We brought that down from kind of the mid-30% to somewhere in the 26%, 27% range as I\u2019d recall. And we\u2019ll continue to work on that to ensure that the leverage exposure that we do have is to customers that we have full relationships with that it\u2019s in industries that we know well is distributed across a variety of different industries. So, we don\u2019t have any real concentrated exposure by industry sector either. And I think we do feel comfortable with it, but I\u2019ll let Barb respond to that question as well. Barb Godin : I think you\u2019ve done a great job responding, John. John Turner : Thank you. Barb Godin : The only thing I have to add is just as you said; these are to our best quality CNI customers that we do leverage lending to in particular. So, we are very comfortable with them. We look at them on a regular basis. We look at the book on a monthly basis and we recycled. If we see something that either is not carrying its weight or that we feel that that\u2019s probably a good opportunity for us to move out of. We take immediate action on it. So again, I\u2019m feeling very good with that book. Gerard Cassidy : I\u2019m just curious, Barb, do you recall during the last downturn what the non-NPL percentage was for leverage loans for regions, where we could dig it up, but if you don\u2019t? Barb Godin : Yes. We\u2019ll have to dig it up; we don\u2019t have it at the top of my head. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. I\u2019m not expecting that. Okay. I\u2019m not expecting that to be the same this time. But I was just curious and maybe, coming back to you, John. At Investor Day, you talked about the expansion into some priority markets in St. Louis, I believe, Atlanta, Orlando, Houston, can you share with us how that is progressing and how do we, as outsiders, determine whether you\u2019re being successful in those markets? John Turner : Well, we think it\u2019s progressing well. We have about 40 de novo branches that have \u2013 that are now open and operating I guess for less than a year, largely across those markets. We continue to reposition our retail franchise as an example in St. Louis as we shift that franchise and we shared this with you at Investor Day, I think we now have access to 10% more households, more wealth, more businesses. The same would be true as we think about the expansion in Atlanta. I think we now have access to more than a million, more or nearly million more customer households, businesses and wealth. And so those opportunities continue to be available to us. The year-over-year checking growth, about 15% of our growth is attributable to de novos. And so \u2013 and we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to provide you all with some information like a percentage of growth attributable to de novos as an example. that\u2019ll give you some sense of how we\u2019re doing. I think, again, core to our strategy is looking for ways to continue to grow our core customer base. So, as we\u2019re growing consumer checking accounts, as we\u2019re growing debit cards usage, as we\u2019re growing credit cards on the consumer side, as we\u2019re growing small business accounts and small business deposit balances, those should be indicators to you that, that our expansion strategy is gaining some traction. We\u2019re recruiting talent in those markets and feel good about the teams we continue to build. all-in-all, I think, we\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue it to on the path to execute that strategy. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. John Turner : Thank you. David Turner : Let me \u2013 this is David. I just want to clean up one thing. So, I think as Saul had asked a question about the impact of beta going into the 30, I said \u2013 and we said more like 10 points on and I said, interest bearing that\u2019s a total, it shouldn\u2019t be total. So, I want to clean that up. John Turner : Okay. I think that\u2019s all the questions we had today. Really appreciate your time. appreciate your interest in regions and thank you very much. Have a good day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shelby and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. The slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement, are available under the investor relations section of our website. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today\u2019s call. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying in the face of significant market volatility, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We reported earnings from continuing operations of $374 million, a 3% increase over the second quarter of the prior year and earnings per share of $0.37, an increase of 16%. We also delivered solid pretax, pre provision income growth compared with the prior year, and generated 4% adjusted positive operating leverage. This quarter's results demonstrate our core business remain strong. And our focus on meeting client need is producing sustainable growth. We grew revenue, average loans and deposits and new customer relationships across market while reducing expenses. We are also experiencing success in our priority market which included Atlanta, Houston, Orlando and St Louis. For example, in Atlanta, the pace of new account and deposit growth is approximately 2x that of net of the total company. Further, we are outperforming the general market in terms of household account growth in each respective location.  Shifting to the corporate bank, in just six months we've added a significant number of new clients across these same markets. Commercial banking growth has been particularly strong in Houston where pipelines for credit and deposits are in all time high. Although it's early, we believe these facts provide evidence that our investments for growing are paying off. We remained focus on those things we can control. And we can continue to feel very good about our future. We are largely complete with our hedging strategy that we began about 18 months ago. These instruments will provide stability to our net interest income and net interest margin. Dave will spend some time discussing the details of that strategy in just a moment.  We also remain well positioned to prudently manage through the next credit cycle because of our ongoing risk mitigation activities, including client selectivity, sound underwriting, rigorous credit servicing and appropriate concentration limits. We remain focused on appropriate capital allocation, balance sheet optimization and risk adjusted returns. This work led to our exit of indirect auto and insurance and the decision to exit a point-of-sale relationship earlier this year. It also informed our strategic decision to achieve better balance between construction and term commercial lending within our real estate business. Another meaningful example of our commitment to build a business that's sustainable over the long term. This quarter, we reposition a portion of our investment securities portfolio, continue to focus on client selectivity and relationship profitability with our loan portfolios and improved our funding mix. These actions will help support net interest income and the net interest margin going forward. Despite recent market uncertainty, the economy still feels pretty good. And while our customers are more cautious than they were just a few months ago, they maintained a positive outlook and most continue to expect better performance this year than last. Many of our customers have a backlog of orders. With the biggest challenge being an insufficient supply of skilled labor. Fundamentally, the domestic economy remains solid, and credit quality continues to reflect relatively stable performance with some continued normalization. And while lower interest rates support continuing economic expansion, they will certainly pressure future revenue growth. To respond, we will continue to build on the momentum we've established through our simplifying grow initiative. To make banking easier, accelerate revenue growth and importantly, become more efficient and effective. Should the market's current path for lower interest rates persist, with short rates declining in second half of 2019 and remaining at lower levels into 2020, and the economy softened faster than we expect, achieving some of our long-term financial targets will be challenging. That being said, we remain committed doing all we can to appropriately adjust our plans and to respond. So to summarize, this was another solid quarter for Regions and despite the market volatility and uncertainty, I feel good about where we are today and believe we're well positioned to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance throughout all phases of the economic cycle. With that, I'll now turn it over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John. During last quarter's call we spent time talking about certain balance sheet optimization efforts. And we're either underway or actively being developed. And today, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the results of those efforts. When we say balance sheet optimization, we're referring to the strategies we execute every day to challenge the efficiency of our balance sheet in order to maximize net interest income and margin, as well as overall profitability and returns. This quarter, adjusted average loans grew approximately 1%. As you may recall, late last quarter we experienced loan growth from certain large corporate customers that while high in quality generated thinner spreads. We anticipated some of these customers which used refinance in the capital markets. Although, we have experienced some movement, the moderation in loan growth this quarter was primarily due to our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability. As John mentioned, loan demand in our markets remain reasonably healthy, but maintaining our disciplined approach impacted overall balance growth. We remain focused on risk adjusted returns and are not interested in trying to out grow the economy by pursuing nominal loan growth for short-term benefit. With that said, we continue to expect full-year growth in average adjusted loans to be in the low to mid single digits. During the quarter, we also executed strategies to better optimize our securities portfolio. We reduce the overall size by approximately $1.5 billion through a combination of maturities and sales. We also sold another $2.8 billion of lower yielding securities and reinvested those proceeds into higher yielding securities, improving our yield run rate by 8 basis points, while recognizing approximately $19 million of net losses. The new securities were selected to ensure appropriate prepayment protection with a focus on improving performance in a declining rate environment. Turning to the liability side of the balance sheet. Average corporate segments deposits decrease 3% during the quarter and included seasonal declines within public fund accounts, as well as an intentional exit of approximately $700 million of higher cost deposits that were added during the first quarter to support loan growth. Despite this reduction, total average deposits still increased approximately 1% driven primarily by growth in consumer. Exhibiting the strength of our core deposit franchise, average consumer deposits increased $1.3 billion and importantly average noninterest-bearing consumer deposits increased almost $600 million. These optimization strategies also triggered a reduction in wholesale funding needs during the quarter. Average FHLB advances are down approximately $1 billion compared to the prior quarter. So let's look at how this impacted net interest income and margin. Net interest income was down slightly compared to the first quarter and net interest margin totaled 3.45%. As expected, continued deposit pricing pressure was the largest driver of this quarter's margin. What is important to know, however, is we did see deposit costs peak within the quarter in May and subsequently trend down in June. Our total deposit costs remain one of the lowest in the industry. And our cumulative deposit beta for the recent tightening cycle is 29%. Assuming the Federal Reserve begins to ease in orderly increments of 25 basis points, we currently expect an initial deposit beta of approximately 35% at the beginning of a down rate cycle. In addition to deposit cost and after normalizing for days, another driver to this quarter's margin was declining market interest rates. This includes the decline we saw in LIBOR in anticipation of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, as well as the decline in loan-in rates. Currently the market is pricing in further interest rate declines over the second half of 2019. So let's spend a few minutes looking at how this could impact our results. While reducing deposit could provide some relief using the June 30 market forwards which includes roughly 325 basis point reductions, we would expect full-year net interest income to be modestly higher than the prior year. While fourth-quarter margin would approach 3.40%, the low end of our long-term range. However, we would expect the first quarter's margin to expand into the low-to-mid 340s as the benefit of our forward starting hedges begins. Now I want to take some time and walk you through our hedging strategy, and its expected financial benefit. Slide 6 contains additional details regarding our use of forward starting swaps and floors along with their anticipated impact to our future asset sensitive profile. The chart provides a cumulative build of the notional value of our hedges broken out by the quarter in which they become effective. We are substantially complete with our hedging program. And importantly, the bulk of those forward starting hedges become active on January 1st, 2020. In addition, these forward starting hedges have maturities of approximately five years from their respective starting. These longer tenures provide better support to future net interest income to the extent rates remains low for an extended period. Because the preponderance of our hedging program is forward starting, many of you may be modeling a negative impact to our future net interest income that will look markedly different six months from now. To illustrate the benefit of our future dated hedges, we have provided the estimated impact to annual net interest income associated with a standard 100 basis point gradual, parallel shock for each future period presented. The table highlights this inverted relationship. As our forward starting hedges become effective, our asset sensitivity is reduced. The key takeaway from this slide is our forward starting hedges will stabilise our interest rate sensitivity profile in 2020 and beyond. So let's move on to fee revenue. Adjustment noninterest income increased 2% compared to the first quarter. Service charges, card and ATM fees and mortgage reflected seasonally higher revenue, combined with continued customer account growth and an increase in transaction activity. Wealth management income increased primarily due to sales and market driven revenue from investment management and trusts, combined with higher sales volumes from investment services. Within mortgage income, our net MSR hedge impact remained relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter. However, as expected in a declining rate environment, we are beginning to experience an increase in prepayment decay. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in capital markets, like on the life insurance and other noninterest income. The declining capital markets were primarily due to lower M&A advisory fees and customer swap income. The decline in customer swap income was almost entirely due to market related credit valuation adjustments tied to customer derivatives. Excluding these market-based adjustments, total capital markets income would have increased approximately 5%. Let's move on to noninterest expense, which continues to be a really good story for Regions. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 1% compared to first quarter. Furniture and equipment expense, outside services and professional fees increase this quarter, but were partially offset by decline in salaries and benefits. A decline in staffing levels of just under 300 full-time equivalent positions combined with a favorable reduction in benefits expense contributed to the decline in salaries benefits. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.3% unchanged from the prior quarter. Despite success in managing our cost, the challenging revenue environment necessitates even more focus on expense management. One area with expense save opportunity is within corporate real estate. This quarter we took advantage of market opportunities and sold a large office building in excess of 100,000 square feet. We also made a decision to market the sale of another large office building in excess of 300,000 square feet. These transactions will benefit future occupancy expense and are expected to help us exceed our goal to reduce over 200 million square feet of space by 2021. Additionally, we continue to make significant progress in the digital space. Digital checking account openings are up 53% and digital card production is up 43% year- to-date. The effective tax rate was 19.4% and it was impacted by excess tax benefits associated with invested equity awards. So let's shift to asset quality. Asset quality continue to perform in line with our expectations this quarter, and reflected stable performance within a relatively benign credit environment, while some normalization of certain credit metrics continued, overall credit results remained well within the acceptable range of our establish risk appetite. Net charge-offs increased to 0.44% of average loans, in line with our expected range of 40 to 50 basis points for 2019.  Provision match net charge-offs resulting in an allowance equal to 1.02% of total loans and 160% of total non-accrual loan. Non accrual loans increased modestly while Business Services criticized loans remained relatively unchanged. And total troubled debt restructurings decreased 7%. While overall asset quality remains stable and within our stated risk appetite, volatility and certain credit metrics can be expected. So let me give you some brief comments related to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the company repurchased 12.8 million shares of common stock for $190 million and declared $141 million in dividends. In June, we announced details related to our 2019 capital plan. We intend to reach our 9.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio target in the third quarter and managed at that approximate level going forward. Our capital plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $1.37 billion of common stock. However, the exact amount and timing of repurchases will be determined by actual loan growth and our overall financial performance. We also expect to increase the quarterly dividend within our stated range of 35% to 45% of earnings. The Board will consider this increase at their meeting next week. Our full year 2019 expectations are presented on slide 11. Assuming the market forward curve at quarter end, we would expect to be at the lower end of our 2% to 4% full-year adjusted revenue growth target. Given the certain revenue environment, we are increasing our focus on expense management and expect full-year adjusted noninterest expense to be stable to down slightly. And we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the year. As John noted, we remain focused on the things we can control. And we are responding to the changing market dynamics as we have in the past. So in summary, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results. We have a solid strategic plan, designed to deliver consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle. With that, we're happy to take your questions. But do ask that you limit them to one primary and one follow-up question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. RyanNash: Hey, good morning guys. So it looks like you've seen an inflection and deposit cost. So they're like a 29%, you had one of the lowest faded cycle to date. So you're talking about the NIM approaching 3.40% and then increasing. Can you just talk about how you feel about your ability to bring down deposit across -- a deposit cost across most of across retail wealth and commercial? And then as you think about the sensitivities you've outlined, given all the changing dynamics on the balance sheet, how do you think about the sensitivity to short versus long-term rates? Then I have a follow-up. DavidTurner: Okay. This is David. So we're encouraged by the reaction of our team's on deposit cost. We clearly are competitive. But we are -- we are able and in the month of June through our actions we took the month before that to reduce deposit cost a couple of basis points. And we put that in the chart to show you that we expect that to have already peaked to the extent that we continue to get short-term rates down that will give us even more ability to reduce deposit cost.  We have about 10% of our deposits are indexed; 10% of our interest bearing deposits are indexed, but we also have another 10% of our interest bearing deposits that are have been exception priced that really money market type deposits if get to address as rate change. So we can move pretty quickly as the market changes which give us some confidence that we continue to hold our margin at that 3.40% level for the remainder of the year. Even then if we get the two roughly three cuts that the forwards imply. RyanNash: Got it and maybe as my follow-up, you talked about the environment being challenging and it might be hard to hit some of your targets. I guess if the rate environment does improve do you think you could still approach the low end of your efficiency and ROTC targets? And then second do you expect to continue to be able to generate positive operating leverage, even if you don't hit the target? Thanks. DavidTurner: Yes. So we made a commitment at Investor Day that we would generate positive operating leverage each year of our three-year plan. Clearly, the rate outlook put some pressure on that, but we still are committed to generating positive operating leverage. If you recall the last three year plan that we had, the market didn't behave quite like we thought it was going to either and we pulled whatever it took to make sure we met the targets. And so we have confidence in that. Clearly, if we have a persistent low rate environment for this whole three-year period that does put pressure on certain of those metrics. But I would like to point out, we're six months into our three-year plans. There are a lot of things that can happen and so we're confident we have a good plan that we have the ability to toggle and do what we need to do to continue to improve our financial performance. And we will do that that was the commitment that was in our prepared comments both from John and from me. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari, Evercore ISI. JohnPancari: Good morning, John. On the expense topic still just I guess longer-term you had an expectation for below 55% efficiency ratio in 2021 or by 2021. Can you just think, just let us know how you are thinking about the, that level and if it's still attainable despite the rate backdrop just giving you're hedging et cetera? Thanks. DavidTurner: Yes. So as I tried to mention to Ryan then, three years is a long time. If you just did the math on this rate persisting for that entire three-year period of time, would be pretty hard to get to a 55% efficiency ratio because we don't want to do is cut our expenses so much we damage our franchise. We can get pretty close to that even in that rate environment because of all the hedging that's in place. But could we hit 55% it would be, again this rate environment persisting the entire time would be pretty tough. JohnTurner: But I would say, John, I mean we're going to remain focused on effective expense management while investing in our business. And so you can expect us to continue to deliver on our commitment to maintain expenses to flat just down slightly while investing in our business. And hopefully growing revenue despite what is a challenging interest rate environment. DavidTurner: Let me add some to that John because we are talking about the interest rate environment. If we have low rate environment with slope to the yield curve that's very helpful. If we have, obviously a higher rate environment with slope that's ideal. A low and flat rate environment with as where we have would have pressure on that 55% margin. JohnPancari: Got it, okay. That's helpful color. DavidTurner: I am sorry, efficiency. JohnPancari: Right, right, got it. Okay and then my follow up are around credit. Just wondered if we can get a little bit more color on the increasing charge-off on the commercial front? Where they come from? And then also your non performers still saw a moderate increase in the quarter despite the higher charge-off. So implying that we are seeing a pick up inflows here. Can you talk about what is driving that? Thanks. BarbGodin: Sure, it's Barb. Relative to charge-offs driven by one loan, it was in the -- it came out of healthcare sector something that we've been working on for quite a while. And finally came to a resolution. So we don't see anything systemic in there. Relative to the NPLs, it was three loans that really drove those numbers of which one has since been paid off. And the other two, we, at this point we don't expect any loss from them. So, again nothing systemic. We are still seeing credit is being stable in our outlook going for the balance of the year. And we are committed again to the 40 to 50 basis points range again for the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. MattO'Connor: Hi. There is puts and takes on the balance sheet kind of outside of loans. You talked about loans and securities, reinvesting them. Just as we think about earnings assets, ex loans, are those kind of relatively stable going forward with the restructuring? I just want to make sure I got all the puts and takes there. DavidTurner: Yes, Matt. I would tell you some of those investment transactions were toward the end of the quarter. So if you look at our average, our average is below with ending was, so you --we're going to feel a little bit of pressure on earning assets from that trade into the third quarter. So it's really not as much on growing net interest income and margin on earning assets as it is the mix. And being able to react to deposit pricing should we have rate reductions. MattO'Connor: Okay. So those -- so the buckets of kind of non loan earning assets will be down a bit on average 3Q verse the 2Q level? DavidTurner: In particular in the investment security portfolio because that trend happened at the end of the quarter. MattO'Connor: Yes, okay. And then just following up on the line of credit discussion right before me. The early stage delinquency numbers also moved up and did that relate to healthcare loan or the commercial inflows, one of which paid off or was that driven something different? BarbGodin: Yes. Part of that is seasonal in our 30-day buckets, 90 day buckets were down, and 30 day was up marginally. And there is nothing systemic in there at all. That is part, it's just a part and parcel of our seasonality. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. JenniferDemba: Thank you. Good morning. Question for you on M&A. Could you just give us an idea of what your interest level is at this point in bank and non-bank M&A? JohnTurner: Yes. Thank you. Our interest in Bank M&A hasn't changed. We remain focused on the execution of our plans. We don't see any material change in the economic analysis of M&A and Bank M&A. And so we're going to continue to watch the market. We're going to continue to pay attention to what's occurring, but our position hasn't changed. With respect to non-bank M&A, we continue to look for opportunities to add capabilities to help grow and diversify revenue to meet customer needs. We recently announced the acquisition of Holland, which is a wealth management capability that complementary to our healthcare business. And one that we're excited about, it's a smaller transaction like the others that we've done. But it's meaningful and that again it helps us, we think grow and diversify revenue and meet a customer need by adding some capabilities. We have been actively looking at mortgage servicing rights acquisitions, but with the rate environment those transactions have become more challenging to find. But we'll continue to do that and within our other businesses, we're again always looking for opportunities to add to our capabilities and will remain active there. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter winter of Wedbush. Peterwinter: Good morning. You guys are putting a little bit more emphasis on the expense side. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the levers because it certainly doesn't seem like you're in slowdown, the investment. DavidTurner: Yes. Peter, that last statement is really important because we are continuing to look for ways to make banking easier for our customers, looking to make investments in talent, technology. We have to pay for that. And way to do that is to continue to focus on our expenses and leverage our simplifying grow continuous improvement program that we started a little over a year and a half ago. If we're going to control our expenses, we have to really have an intense focus on our top three categories, salaries and benefits being number one. Down some 300 positions at this quarter, we continue to look to opportunities to streamline operations by leveraging technology. And most of that gets handled through attrition. We've looked at occupancy, our next biggest category as we had in our prepared comments, we had some 400,000 square feet of space that we're exiting. Some of it we have exited; some what we just put in held for sale and we will be getting out of that space to save us on run rate occupancy. Also furniture, fixtures and equipment, our third category as we have here people, we have a smaller space we can save there as well. And our fourth category would be kind of purchasing or vendor spends, if you will. We have a, do had procurement that is really put in a lot of rigor in terms of helping us from a demand management standpoint on controlling what we need from a purchasing standpoint. Whether it is consulting hours or products or whatever the case may be. And so we're, we, this type of challenging revenue environment and a commitment to positive operating leverage, you just have to pull every string that you can in terms of controlling expenses. JohnTurner: And I'd add, Peter, we're, as we've said a few times, we're really pleased with our simplify grow initiative and we're really only beginning to see the benefits of the continuous improvement work that's occurring. And I asked John Owen who has led that initiative just too briefly talk about a couple of other things that opportunities that we see through the use of our digital capabilities to drive improvement. John? JohnOwen: Yes. Good morning, everybody. We had about 17 new initiatives to our simplify and grow list. In the second quarter bringing that number up to about 62 initiatives. We've already completed 13 year-to-date. We will complete another 11 initiatives in the second half of 2019. When I think about some of the things we point to, go back to Investor Day, we talked about launching our digital lending platform and the consumer side of the house. That has really taken traction. We're seeing 38% of our applications today come in through that digital channel. On the e-side, e-close part of this, we're up to about 58% of our direct loans, closing of e-signs are really good traction of digital lending capabilities. On the account opening, we're in a digital front. I think I'd point you to, we've had a team as part of simplify and grow working now for about a year, how do we streamline account opening, and how do we make the credit card process more smooth process and quicker process. I would revise the application, we've streamlined and we now are getting about 53% increases in our digital account opening and checking accounts. And about a 44% increase in credit card production to that digital channel. So really good traction there. On the AI front, we continue to look for use cases on how we can roll out AI across the bank. You're all familiar with what we've done in the contact center. We've expanded a couple things in the contact center with AI. One of those is now where we launch password resets, which is one of our top calls into the center. We launched that in this month and we're seeing really good traction and having our AI virtual agent handle those password resets. The last thing is we're having good success with AI and our quality assurance functions, where we're actually having the AI virtual agent Quality Assurance call types categories and really go through and make sure that our reps are following the right disclosures and right scripts. That's reducing our expenses in that QA area by about 70%. So good traction with AI as well. Peterwinter: And then if I could ask with the hedging strategy really starting to kick in beginning in next year and you gave the outlook for the margin in the first quarter. Should we expect the margin going forward next year to be kind of flat to up? DavidTurner: Yes. I think to the extent, so we're all assuming that the forwards actually work their way through for next year. As you can see on the chart, I think of slide 6 where we are trying to show you more and more hedging more and more the derivatives actually become effective, which helps us stabilize margin and what we're trying to do through the hedging program is just neutralized impact of insurance policy on lower rates, which prevents us from having to grow net interest income and margin from coming out of a hole. So now you can have organic growth and the balance sheet putting on good earning assets to give you the kind of growth that you want to have. So we're not having to work against say, a headwind like we think many others might have. And so we do have the ability to grow depending on what we put on in terms of earning assets in 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. KenUsdin: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just a follow-up on that last question. So your scenario that you put out on page 5 which is really helpful, takes in three potential cuts that are in the forward curve. And this might be just more of a semantic one but I'm just wondering if the Fed only gives us one, how that saving changes potentially in terms of the decline before the hedge is come on. Like is it just like you end up in the same place but from a slightly different way of getting there or I just wanted to get --just trying to understand how the cadence might change if we don't fully get the three cuts of the curve? DavidTurner: Yes. So, Ken, couple things to think about our sensitivity. We really have two things working. First is to your point the short end of the curve. So the short end of the curve is where our derivatives are tied to generally speaking one month LIBOR, we have received fixed so cuts in short term with the protection on the other receive fixed derivatives, and our ability to reduce deposit cost in that 35% deposit beta that we are talking about gives us the confidence that we have in 2020. So even if you have one, two, three cuts in the short end, we have protection under any of those scenarios. It's then the second part is what happens to the long end of the curve. And so if we have slope to the curve even in us in a lower rate environment, if we have slope we are protected as well because the reinvestments coming off the investment portfolio on the like are really are tied to the long end. It's the, we don't want us to have a lower and flatter yield curve which is horrible for our industry as you know. So we're not as concerned about whether it's one, two or three because we'll react appropriately as long as we can get the, at the long end, at least stay where it is and maybe even increase a bit. KenUsdin: Got it. So regardless of the pacing then you feel pretty good that 1Q, 2020 loaded mid 3, 20s can happen in most any circumstance except for a meaningfully flatter curve environment? DavidTurner: That's exactly right. And we had our protection. We've -- we put the started putting this on over a year and a half ago with the expectation that we are going to be in this environment. We just thought it would be beginning in 2020 which is why we did forward starting. We did, we thought there are going to be rate increases through 2019 and we want to stay asset sensitive, so we've caught, been caught a little bit exposed in the latter part of 2019 as has have every peer of ours. But we're feeling pretty good about what can take place in 2020. And going forward, we have duration on those swaps in floors of five years beginning in 2020. So we have really good protection then. KenUsdin: Okay, got it. And then last just clean up on those forward charting swaps that you've got the fixed-rate strike on there. Are they at -- are they meaningfully different ones? The average is obviously 2.48% for the swaps and 2.08% for the floors on page six, but as you put them on, are they all around kind of a general average there or they are depends on which one they could be very much in or out of the money across the book? DavidTurner: Yes. The averaging that we've given you, so we went to disclose a lot more this time to give you the ability to do your models. And we think the averaging is going to be representative enough. There will be 25 points here there but nothing that's really going to skew that from using the averages. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. ErikaNajarian: Good morning. I just wanted to clarify the response to Ryan's earlier question. As we think about the 35% deposit beta, given that deposit costs already peaked in May? Or is that for the initial 25 basis points? And as we think about 2020 what do you think, and if the forward curve is right and that will get three cuts and then maybe not anymore, what could the ultimate sort of reverse deposit data be on those 75 basis points of cut? DavidTurner: Yes. I think we're going to start at 35. I think over time we're at 29 cumulative going up. So if you're starting at 35 you would expect that to drift down a bit as time goes through. I think that's what you're asking. ErikaNajarian: So the initiative to clarify the initial impact is immediate in terms of the 35% especially on the 20% of your interest bearing deposits that you are identifying as either quite expensive or indexed? And then it would taper that the repricing would taper off in terms of percentage of cuts rather than accelerate. I guess -- DavidTurner: Yes. You're exactly right. So it starts at 35 and then at the end of the day you're going to drift from that 35 down into the higher 20s as that -- and the driver of that is the 10% indexing at the exception pricing engine then just looking at the market of all of our deposits we compared to our peers. And we get the benefit of our floors. And we get the benefit of our receive pick swaps. ErikaNajarian: Got it. And, John, just wanted to clarify, you loud and clear that 55 and below on efficiency isn't difficult in this rate environment. You did something earlier as an answer, a reply to a question that's flat to down slightly on expenses still a commitment. And is that what we should think about over this three-year period regardless of the rate environment? DavidTurner: Yes. So this is David. So the flat to slightly down was an answer to 2019 changing our guidance there. I think your question is then what does it mean for the next three years, if we're in this challenging revenue environment. We clearly, we have to 2% and 2.5% inflation baked into our expense base every year. And so we have to continue to see cuts, if we want to keep expenses relatively stable. We have to find ways to cut that 2.5%. So and then if we want to make investments on top of that we got to find even more. Our commitment is that we would generate positive operating leverage under any of those environments, each of those three years. Clearly, a lower rate environment, a flatter yield curve makes that very tough. But that's what we seek to do. And we're going to do whatever it takes to meet our expectations that we've laid out. The commitment was 55% three years from now, we're only six months there. So we're not giving up on 55% by any stretch. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. SaulMartinez: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So I guess I'm still a little bit confused on the 35% deposit beta. And either glide path thereafter for future cuts. So are you saying that on the first 35 or the first 25 basis point cut, you'll see a decline in your interest bearing deposit cost of 35% beta on the decline on your interest bearing deposit cost? And over what time period does that occur? That's sort of an immediate decline or is that something that drags on over a couple quarters as new pricing filters in? Because it seems like, the commentary from some other banks has been that there is going to be a lag in terms of what deposit beta is and that they are going to accelerate not decelerators as rate cuts, further rate cuts happened. DavidTurner: Yes. So we felt like ours are going to happen a little quicker because of the indexing that we have on 10% of our $60 billion of interest bearing deposits, another 10% exception price that we can move quickly to. So we think that can be pretty high early on. And we think that that could be maintained perhaps for a couple of quarters. At some point though that has to taper off. We're only up 29, so if you start at 35 some point it has to taper off as you get to an absolute floor in terms of deposit cost. So does that help? SaulMartinez: Yes. I think so. But so the 35% then you're saying is pretty immediate? DavidTurner: That's correct. SaulMartinez: Okay. I guess just more of a conceptual question then on NII and how to think about net interest income growth in 2020 and 2021. I'm not certainly not asking for guidance. I know it's too early for that. But the extent you have stabilized your rate sensitivity, you've neutralized it to a large degree. When we think about NII growth beyond this year, should we be thinking net interest income grows more in line with loan growth average earning balance growth and mix shift and that occurs not necessarily independently of rates, but that being a much bigger driver of net interest income growth regardless of what the rate environment does. DavidTurner: That's exactly what we were trying to communicate that our hedging program gave, is giving us the opportunity do not have to climb out of a hole to grow NII margin rather neutralizes that it was insurance protection of low rate environment not to give us a tailwind but to keep us from having this massive headwind. And therefore we could participate in growing NII and margin as we continue to grow earning assets watching our deposit cost. Our deposit franchises still our number one competitive advantage. And we think that's going to help us continue to grow NII with appropriate balance sheet growth. SaulMartinez: Okay, no, that's helpful. If I can sneak one quick final one in. I don't know if I missed it but the outlook for indirect auto and indirect other consumer, now that you guys have GreenSky or exited not renewed the commitment there. How do we think about, can you remind us what your expectations are for balances there and how much fines and what the other consumer line balance should do? DavidTurner: And so if you look at in hour supplement on page 21, you'll see our indirect vehicle decline this past quarter some $350 million. So we're kind of on that kind of run rate. We're not renewing that. It'll take some time. The whole average for the year will be about $800 million on the indirect auto decline. I'm sorry that's not auto, I mean GreenSky. SaulMartinez: Yes, GreenSky, okay. Thank you. JohnTurner: Yes. We need to clarify that. I think it's $800 million on average on the indirect auto portfolio full year, right, that's right. And then the runoff with respect to the indirect unsecured portfolio, it will top out over the next month or two as that contract expires and then we kind of expected 2 to 2.5 year sort of weighted average payout on that portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. ChristopherMarinac: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the environment [Indiscernible] late this year or next year about hiring teams of producers. Is this the environment where you invest in that or perhaps a few new markets come into the Regions' footprint because of external opportunities? JohnTurner: Yes. I mean we're -- all of our business leaders' as well commercial corporate, real estate is actively recruiting all the time. Our consumer business similarly. One of our --one of their tasks is to always know who the best bankers are in their markets and in contiguous markets who the best bankers are in their specialized businesses. And so we're always actively recruiting. And we've had good success recruiting already this year across particularly our priority markets where we are investing St. Louis, Atlanta, and Houston and in Orlando and we'll continue to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. KevinBarker: Good morning. I was hoping you can give us a little more color on 9.5% CET 1 ratio target for the third quarter? It would seem that would imply a pretty aggressive buyback this quarter. And then maybe a tail off through the rest of the CCAR cycle? And maybe you just help us out with the cadence of the buyback in the near term and then through the cycle. DavidTurner: Yes. Kevin, so you're exactly right. We put into our prepared comments that we were going to get to our 9.5% in the third quarter. Obviously we have loan growth that uses up some of that and dividends and then buying back to get us to that 9.5%, we will -- it will be exactly that every single quarter. But we're going to do what we can to keep it at that level because that's a level of capital, we think we need to run the company based on our risk profile. That does imply a quicker buyback or more of a buyback here in the short term. It will moderate after that and we will use the repurchase ability. So we have authorization for our board up to $1.37 billion of stock buyback and how we think about capital allocation is first and foremost, we'll pay a dividend of 35% to 45% of our earnings. Then we're going to use some for organic loan growth and then we'll use the rest, we'll buy stock back to keep us at that 9.5%. Should loans grow faster, buybacks will be smaller and vice versa. If loans don't grow buybacks will increase, so that we can keep the capital optimized in the company. KevinBarker: Okay. So given the authorization that you have for this cycle it would imply that or it would seem better imply that we keep the loan growth relatively low single digits or somewhere very close to that or maybe even closer to stable in the near term. Is there anything you're doing within the balance sheet in order to decrease risk weighted assets or some other way in order to keep the ratio at 9.5% given the buyback authorization you have in place? DavidTurner: No. We're --we, our teams are out there growing loans when it makes sense from a risk adjusted return standpoint. We grew the first quarter a little quicker than we had expected. We slowed that down a bit this quarter. We still have the low to mid-single digit growth expectation for the year. Again any given quarter you can see a pace change. The third quarter for us over the last couple years haven't --has not been as stronger for growth even though our pipelines look pretty good. The fourth quarter on the other hand it's actually been pretty strong. So we're sticking to our -- to that commitment on the loan growth. My point is that we use 9.5% and we toggle between loan growth and share buyback. We're not trying to manufacture one or the other. We want all the goods, we would much rather use our capital to grow organically than to buy our stock back. But we also want to have appropriate risk-adjusted client relationship type returns on the loan side. And if we don't get those and we can't use our capital to grow appropriately, that we will buy our stock back that makes sense. Operator : Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. GerardCassidy: Question. Can you guys share with us -- we've seen a lot of commentary on by the strength of the consumer business and we all know how low the unemployment rate is in this country and the wage growth seems to be accelerating. But there seems to be some cross currents in the business side of our economy with what's going on with the trade negotiations, et cetera. So can you give us some insight of what your business customers are sharing with you about their business. And could you tie that into the forward curve of 325 basis points rate cuts in 2019. Just seems like the forward curve as being a little aggressive on those rate cuts. But I'm just curious to see what you guys think. JohnTurner: Well, to answer the second half of your question, no, we cannot tie it into the forward curve. I would tell you that our business customers are still cautiously optimistic. It was clearly over the last 90 days or so, I sense more caution on the part of our business owners. But they're still optimistic, their 2018 results were very good. Most of them are having really good 2019 as we look at our credit quality across a variety of industry sectors really don't see any significant issues other than within the restaurant sub sector, we've called out before fast casual, don't appear to be any other stresses of any consequence that we see. Customers have good pipelines and so as I think I said in my prepared remarks, the primary constraint we see on the economy is the availability of skilled labor.  And that's the thing that tends to constrain businesses from investing not the interest rate environment. And so I really can't tie our view of the economy through our customer's eyes to the forward rate curve. GerardCassidy: Very good. And then can you guys share with us an update on CECL, where you stand and when we may get Day 1 estimate on the build up of reserves in January of 2020? DavidTurner: Sure, Gerard. So we've been -- our teams have been working really hard to run parallel this year. We're feeling good about being prepared for the adoption also in January 2020. We're looking to put something in our 10-Q that would give some indication as to where we might be here shortly on Day 1. As we've mentioned before, consumer portfolios get hit really hard relative to commercial portfolios. And so we have about 40% of our loans, our consumer loans versus business services loans. So mortgages, HELOCS, credit cards, those unsecured credit, those get hit pretty hard in the seasonal adoption not as much on the commercial side. But stay tuned here shortly on our 10-Q filing. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. I'll turn the call back over to John Turner for closing remarks. John Turner : Well, thank everybody for their interest. I hope you can tell we think we have a solid quarter despite the volatility in the market. We're focused on things that we can control. Client selectivity, sound underwriting, credit servicing, effective expense management, resource allocation and risk adjusted returns. We have a good plan. We think to neutralize our interest rate sensitivity. And we believe we're well positioned to continue to execute on our plans. And we stay focused on that. So thank you for your interest in Regions. And have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions' third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance and David Turner, will take you through an overview of the quarter. Earnings related documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our Web site. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the Q&A segment of today's call. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana. And thank you all for joining our call today. This morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $385 million, a 9% increase over the third quarter of last year, resulting in earnings per share of $0.39, an increase of 22% over the prior-year. This quarter, we also delivered the highest pre-tax pre-provision income that we produced in nearly a decade, while generating 3% adjusted positive operating leverage year-to-date. All-in-all, despite lower interest rates and significant market volatility, it was a very solid quarter. Over the last two years, our core messaging has reflected our intention to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance through all phases of the economic cycle. We've been planning for the time when we would no longer benefit from a rising rate environment, and when credit would begin to normalize. Since late 2017, we began taking incremental actions to reduce our interest rate risk, build a stronger and more resilient balance sheet and improve returns on capital. We executed a robust hedging strategy that will protect us in a declining rate environment, and allows us to maintain a healthy and stable margin without having to stretch for loan growth. With respect to credit, our team has spent the better part of the last 10 years fundamentally changing and improving our credit risk management framework. Today, we have a robust and dynamic process, sitting on appropriate concentration risk, sound underwriting, rigorous client servicing and early identification of potential problems. We've also intensified our focus on risk adjusted returns and appropriate capital allocation, balance sheet optimization, derisking, and repositioning. Just as important we launched our continuous improvement initiative called, Simplify and Grow, focusing on our desire to make banking easier for our customers and associates, accelerating revenue growth and driving efficiency and effectiveness. We've already benefited significantly from these efforts and we have much more to do. We have completed 16 of 67 initiatives, and expect to complete seven more by year-end. These efforts have allowed us to make significant investments in technology to better serve our customers and we're seeing the benefits of those investments. For example, through our digital platform, year-to-date checking and credit card production have increased 24% and 91%, respectively. Loan applications have increased 55% and with mortgage in particular approximately 60% of all applications are completed online. Mobile deposits have increased 60%, now represent 13% of all deposits. These efforts are paying off and positively impacting the performance of our businesses. Simplify and Grow has allowed us to make investments in talent, improve services and capabilities and in our markets, all while prudently managing our expense base, and these investments are also paying off. We continue to grow consumer checking accounts and households, as well as wealth assets under management. We're also succeeding in our priority growth markets, Atlanta, Houston, Orlando and St. Louis. Consumer deposits and checking accounts in these markets are growing more than two times faster than the consumer bank average. Similarly, Corporate Bank revenue and loans are growing faster than the Corporate Bank average. Although, it's relatively early, we are very pleased with the performance of these markets as we are delivering results above our expectations. With respect to the economy, our customers are still generally optimistic about their businesses. But they are becoming more cautious, given continued market volatility and uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs. Many are taking a wait and see approach when it comes to business investments. However, pipelines remain steady, good, but not great. So in summary, we have a lot of positive momentum and feel good about how we're positioned. Our plan is to remain focused on the things we can control; meeting the needs of our customers with best-in-class service, while leveraging technology and making it easier for our customers to bank with us. We're also focused on the fundamentals of our business; generating positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management, while making prudent investment decisions. We're focused on soundness, profitability and growth and that order of priority. We believe our efforts will keep the company positioned to deliver consistent, sustainable results through every economic cycle. Thank you for your time and attention this morning. I will now turn the call over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average total loans decreased approximately 1%. Adjusted average consumer loans increased modestly, led by residential mortgage and indirect other consumer lending. Adjusted average business loans decreased 1% and were impacted by our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability. Average business loans also reflected  Average business loans also reflected lower line utilization and elevated paydown activity during the quarter, including increased capital markets activities. We continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and are not interested in pursuing nominal loan growth for short-term benefit. And as John noted, due in part to our hedging program, we are not pressured to stretch for growth. With that said, we continue to expect full-year adjusted average loan growth in the low to mid single-digits. Turning to average deposits. Despite interest rate decreases on deposits and seasonal declines in public fund accounts, average deposits decreased less than 1% during the quarter, exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise. So let's look at how this impacted net interest income and margin. Despite lower rates, net interest income was down just slightly compared to the second quarter and net interest margin declined only 1 basis point to 3.44%. Net interest margin and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower market interest rates and lower average loan balances, partially offset by declining deposit costs and the benefits of repositioning strategies in the investment portfolio that were executed in the second quarter. Net interest income also benefited from one additional day in the quarter, which negatively impacted net interest margin. As expected, total deposit cost declined 4 basis points compared to the second quarter to 49 basis points and interest-bearing deposit cost declined 5 basis points to 77 basis points, one of the lowest in the industry. The deposit beta associated with declining interest rates was 25% this quarter, and we expect to experience a deposit beta in the 25% to 30% range in the fourth quarter. In an effort to reduce net interest income sensitivity to long-term rates, we repositioned out of approximately $1.2 billion of mortgage-backed securities into prepayment protected securities this quarter. These reallocations reduced our exposure to mortgage-backed securities by approximately 7% and our related book premium by approximately 8%. We're also exploring additional opportunities to further reduce sensitivity to long-term rates. In fact, we added additional hedges subsequent to quarter-end that are intended to reduce the impact of lower long-term rates on 2020 loan originations. Assuming two 25 basis point reductions in the Fed funds rate by year-end, we expect some near-term pressure on net interest income and net interest margin in the fourth quarter, which we can partially mitigate through reductions in deposit costs. Net interest margin is expected to move in the high 330s in the fourth quarter. However, we expect the first quarter margin to expand into the low 340s, as the benefits of our hedging strategy began. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expenses. We delivered strong results this quarter with adjusted non-interest income increasing 9% compared to the second quarter, led by growth in service charges, wealth management and mortgage, as well as favorable market value adjustments on employee benefit assets. The increase in wealth management income includes a modest benefit from the recent acquisition of an institutional investment firm, Highland Associates. Total mortgage income increased significantly, driven primarily by increasing hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights. Additionally, mortgage production and sales income also increased, consistent with elevated production, highlighting the benefit of our strategic focus and our decision to add mortgage loan originators earlier in the year. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in capital markets income and card and ATM fees. The declining capital markets income was attributable primarily to decreases in M&A advisory services and loan syndication revenue. Customer swap income was also negatively impacted by CVA adjustments during the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to finish this year on a strong note with fourth quarter revenue exceeding this quarter's reported results. The decline in card and ATM fees reflected the impact of favorable commercial interchange rebate adjustments recorded in the prior quarter that did not repeat. We continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of approximately 2%. Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense increased less than 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher salaries and benefits, partially offset by decreases in professional fees and outside services. The increase in salaries and benefits was driven primarily by an increase in the market value on employee benefit assets, as well as higher production-based incentives, one additional weekday in the quarter and the addition of Highland Associates. These increases were partially offset by continued overall staffing reductions. The decreases in professional fees and outside services were primarily due to lower legal costs, and our continued success in reducing overall third-party spends. The company's third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio decreased 90 basis points to 57.4%, and the effective tax rate was approximately 20.6%. As John mentioned, we continue to benefit from our continuous improvement process, and several Simplify and Grow initiatives are exceeding our initial expectations. For example, at Investor Day, we committed to reducing our total square footage by 2.1 million square feet and our third-party spend by $60 million to $65 million by 2021. We also told you we plan to consolidate 100 branches during the same period. We are proud to say that we are on track to exceed our targets in each of these areas, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to pull forward or expand on initiatives where we can. These efforts exhibit our commitment to achieving positive operating leverage. Based on our results through the first nine months and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we expect full year 2019 adjusted expenses to be relatively stable with 2018. With respect to our effective tax rate, we tightened full year 2019 range to 20% to 21%. So let's shift to asset quality. Overall, credit results remained in line with our risk expectations during the quarter. We saw improvement in several categories, while experiencing some normalization in others. Net charge-offs were unchanged at 44 basis points, in line with our expected range of 40 basis points to 50 basis points for 2019. The allowance for loan losses amounted to 1.05% of total loans, and 188% of total non-accrual loans. Non-performing loans decreased 13%, while delinquencies and total troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4% and 7%, respectively. Business services criticized loans increased 9%, driven primarily by increases in classified loans, partially offset by reductions in non-accrual and special mention loans. The largest increases to classified loans were attributable to energy, retail trade and manufacturing sectors. As a reminder, our third quarter credit metrics also include the results of most recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Provision exceeded net charge-offs during the quarter, primarily due to these downgrades as we've begun to see some stress within the energy and tariff-related sectors. However, potential losses associated with these credits are expected to be modest and within our expectations. Moreover, we anticipate several will cure in full over the next few quarters. Let me comment briefly on the CECL. In our second quarter 10-Q, we disclosed an expected increase in our allowance for credit losses of approximately $400 million to $600 million due to the implementation of CECL. As we get closer to adoption, we expect subsequent disclosures to include a tighter range of impact and will reflect evolving macroeconomic conditions and forecast, as well as any appropriate updates to loan composition and quality. So let's take a look at capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the company repurchased 39.7 million shares of common stock for $589 million and declared $150 million in dividends. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio is estimated at 9.6%, in line with our target level of 9.5%. And we anticipate managing at this approximate level going forward. The loan deposit ratio at the end of the third quarter was 88%. And as of quarter end, we remain fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule. Wrapping things up, in light of the challenging and changing economic backdrop, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results. We have a solid strategic plan, designed to deliver consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle. With that, we're happy to take your questions. But do ask that each caller ask only one question to allow for more callers. We will open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So I wanted to ask a handful of questions. Maybe just first on deposit costs. So we saw them come down nicely on the high-end of peers 25% to 30% decline next quarter. I just wanted to double check to make sure that's based on September and the potential for an October. And I guess, you know, you're one of the only banks we saw a top quartile performance on the way up. And now you're outperforming on the way down. So could you maybe just talk about what you're seeing about across both consumer and commercial and if Fed is to cut in October beyond a couple of times next year, is there further room to bring down deposit costs? David Turner : Yes, Ryan, this is David. So we've talked an awful lot about how to manage net interest income and margin in changing rate environments and deposit costs being a key input is important to manage both. So let me start with consumer. We've done a really good job of adjusting our deposit cost while staying competitive in the markets we are competing in. And that's been a big driver of our deposit cost declining. I think what you'll see going forward is probably more contribution coming from the commercial side they've done a pretty good job. A lot of those deposits are indexed, if you recall in the first quarter, we increased deposit cost because we had above average loan growth that we had to use deposits to fund that loan growth that's clearly subsided and we're looking at adjusting those deposit cost on the way down. So we have a beta of 25% to 30% that we are giving you guidance for and we think that will apply to the two rate -- potential rate cuts that we see for the remainder of the year. Ryan Nash : And then if I could follow-up on expenses. I mean clearly the revenue environment has been challenging, you guys are doing a better job than others to defend the margin. David, you talked about completing 16 of 67 initiatives for Simplify and Grow and you're going have a handful more done before the end of the year, and you talked about upside some of the areas that the three big areas that you're saving on cost. So as you think ahead, you're clearly holding cost stable this year, but are there enough levers for you to continue to invest in things like technology and grow the business and continue to hold expenses flat beyond 2019? Thanks. David Turner : So I won't comment quite on '20, yet. But the way we think about it is, we are continuing to make investments in talent, mortgage loan originators, commercial ORMs, wealth advisors. We've continued to make investments in technology, 42% of our $625 million is spent on new things that we need to have to continue to make banking easier for our customers. We have to do that and we will continue to do that. But in order to make room for that and control costs, we have to get better at literally everything we do. So John has asked all of us, all 20,000 people that work here, how do we get better at whatever we do tomorrow than we did yesterday, so that we can continue to make room for investments that we want to make. We have inflation in our expense base of about 2.5%. So we have to overcome that inflation plus the investments to be able to hold our cost relatively stable like we've done for the last couple of years. We will continue to seek to hold our cost down and we have a goal of efficiency to get to the 55% range, we mentioned that at Investor Day. We were 57.4% today, obviously it's very challenging in a low rate environment, but we are not giving up. We're going to continue to seek becoming more efficient as we go forward. So there is still room to control -- control cost into 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could just talk about kind of big picture, how you think about balancing, protecting the profitability ratios versus growing the balance sheet, you've been keeping deposits relatively stable, it's helping NIM, you're obviously seeing good growth in service charges. So there's some puts and takes. But talk about the trade-off between the focus to protect the profitability. But then also thinking about trying to grow the balance sheet? John Turner : Yes, I think it is a great question. It is very much a balance. We are focused on building a business that's going to be consistently performing, that's going to be resilient, it's going to be sustainable. And that means we've got to build a balance sheet that it is resilient through every economic cycle. We've clearly traded-off some growth for quality and we'll continue to do that, Matt. As we focus on, we think it's a period of time in the economic cycle, and we need to be thoughtful, careful, client selectivity is really important to us. Early identification of problems, exiting relationships that may become problematic, really important to our future. So we talk often about the importance of soundness first then profitability and growth last, we are not going to grow just to grow. We don't need nominal growth. We think the balance sheet is positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable performance and the profitability that we believe will adequately reward our shareholders and that will continue to be our focus. David Turner : I'll add, Matt. We do expect to grow, as we said we would grow low to mid single-digits in terms of loans for the year. We were up about 4.8% year-to-date on an adjusted basis. And so what we're saying is, we do expect to grow. We're just not going to force growth on the balance sheet to generate nominal revenue and nominal income if the return gets harmed. Matt O'Connor: And I guess just following up, I mean, you obviously had really nice loan growth in the first half of the year, a little bit of run-off this quarter and I think one of your other portfolios might start to run-off by end of the year. It's as you kind of put all it together in the comments that you made, what's kind of a more medium term outlook in terms of -- grow loans. And then also just comment on deposits as well. Thank you. John Turner : Well, with respect to loan growth, I think what we've said is that we anticipate growing low single-digits typically with the economy, plus a little in the markets that we operate in. We think that that's appropriate if you look at year-over-year business services loan growth has been about 7.5%. We do have some run-off portfolios in consumer in particular. We've seen some declines in equity lending and indirect auto. We're capping our exposure to indirect unsecured lending, but we believe that our focus on continuing to build out the consumer business. At the same time, our commitment to business services lending particularly middle market commercial lending will drive an appropriate amount of loan growth and allow us to continue to grow the assets on the balance sheet. And with respect to deposits, we're focused on core relationships. And when you look at our consumer business, we believe that 93% plus of our customers maintain their primary operating account with us. We're continuing to grow consumer checking accounts at a rate we think faster than most of our peers, consumer demand deposits and consumer low-cost deposits growing over time. Similarly, with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses, winning their operating business, we think we can still continue to grow low-cost deposits, which is really the core of our business and the strength of our franchise. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : David, could you talk a little bit about the balance sheet protection, a little bit more. Just reading in the deck, you added a little bit more on the hedging side to impact of lower long-term rates. So you said the program is largely completed, I guess, can you just help us understand the math of the magnitude of the step-up that helps get the NIM up as you look from fourth to first and then how that will cascade on its own throughout the year. Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So I'll start Ken with the end in mind. We talked about the -- going into next year, we think our margin could increase into the low to mid-3.40 range. We have a chart with regards to our sensitivity our short-term sensitivity is taken close to zero. By the beginning of the year through all the hedges that kick in and starting, little bit in the fourth quarter, but primarily the first part of the year. What we want to do is we have more exposure on the long-end than a lot of our peers. So we wanted to kind of neutralize that a bit. So we've entered into a couple of million dollar worth of hedges that would really be -- that kind of got tied in when the tenure was in the mid-low 170 range to help us from the long-end. And that's really manifests itself and reinvestment of cash flows that come off the business every month. So that's baked into the guidance that we're giving you. And we believe that we're not going to have a disproportionate correlation to the tenure relative to our peers after this. Ken Usdin : And on the left side of the balance sheet, can you just discuss the MBS repositioning that you did and what premium was and how does this change that magnitude that you'd expect. Thanks, David. David Turner : Yes. So premium amortization was relatively stable in the quarter about $28 million in the quarter. What we did is we took some low-yielding investment securities that we could sell, we took those, we repositioned those into longer, a little more duration, a little more carry to help us. Just again boost a little bit from an NII standpoint, but they were really lower yielding mortgage-backed securities that we sold and reinvested. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So couple of questions. You know the background for the question just has to do with the longer-term outlook for ROTC which I know you put out at. I think it was like 15% to 18%, is that right at the Investor Day? John Turner : Actually, 18% to 20%. Betsy Graseck : Sorry 18% to 20%, yeah, 18% to 20%, sorry. John Turner : Little different interest rate environment. Betsy Graseck : So the question that I have is, how are you thinking about that, you know, when I'm looking at it, I'm hearing. Okay. You've got a lot more opportunity on the expense side and maybe that expense -- operating leverage improves as we go through the next couple of years. But then I'm also wondering about the capital side of the equation here and how you're thinking about that. I know you have your 9.5% target, but given the tailoring rule that came out and everything else that's been happening for banks in your sizes, 9.5% still the right number for you? David Turner : Yes. So I'll start with your last question. We calculate the amount of capital we need to have based on our models. Not, it's not regulatory driven, and yes, we are encouraged by the tailoring relief that we have, but does not change one iota the amount of rigor that we put in the capital planning and management. We still have, every other year our CCAR submission. So for the time being, 9.5% was our target. We try to put that in our prepared comments to even though our math really says, we could get to 9%. We've added 50 basis points of cushion to enable us to take advantage of opportunities should they arise. As the market uncertainty and the economic conditions continue to decline a bit. As it relates, and the 9.5% was going to allow us to get to the kind of returns we think are appropriate given the circumstances that we're under. Now the 18% to 20% was, as John was saying in the middle of your question that we had, and that was very different interest rate environment, we all thought rates were going to go up this year and they're clearly are down and they are forecasted to be down through the period of time we have covered by that Investor Day. So getting to 18% to 20% would be very difficult to do without taking some unusual risk, which we will not do. So we're going to come out and we'll update the exact targets for you later, but clearly, there has been some decline in terms of return expectations. I think that's what's our -- the stock prices in our industry have reflected. But exactly, where those will be, we need to get a little better handle where we think rates will go. We have two baked in for this year, there's probably another one coming in '20 as well. So more to come, Betsy. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : I wondered if you could talk a little bit more on the investments you're making in IT. I believe, you're currently evaluating, replacing your core deposit system and -- so I wonder if you can give us some details around that in terms of what's the timeframe around that type of project, what's the cost impact that we should be considering here, could it impact next year's numbers. And then, and then is there other systems -- are you looking at the core system on the loan side as well as or just the deposit system issue. Thank you. John Turner : We just had our strategic planning offsite meeting with our Board, spend a lot of time talking about the topic and so I ask John Owen to address it. John Owen : Yes, just to go back to Investor Day, we spend about $625 million a year on technology, have about 1600 plus technology professionals at the bank and every year in our strategic annual planning process, we go through about a three year to five year view and find out and we'll talk about what systems need to be upgraded, consolidated or replaced. And each year, there's about 15 systems that we identify that will need to go out and either upgrade or replace. So this is just a normal case of business from a cause of business today. You mentioned some of the core systems around deposits. We are going to have an RFP that will go out in the first quarter for our deposit system. We will get those results back probably mid-year and we'll make a choice on what's the right platform for us. The timeframe for that, it's probably a three year to six year journey for this. What you'll find with us, when we do upgrades. We don't do very many big bang upgrades. This will be an incremental approach over a multi-year time period. So again this is a probably a four year to six year system exchange in this particular case. But I would tell you, we do about 15 of these a year, this would be a larger one, of course, but again, to go back to our wealth platform, we did SCI a couple of years ago. We consolidated 14 systems into one. We're fortunate to operate on one consumer platform and we're in the point of implementing and seeing now at this point in time. So what I would tell you, it is large. We are in the RFP process, but this is nothing that we don't do 15 to 17 of every year. John Turner : In our analysis John, we indicate that we can complete the work within the context of our current technology spend. So we don't see any outsized sort of allocation to expense associated with any of the core system changes. John Pancari : And then one, I apologize, this is little bit off the radar a little bit, this question. But on Friday, you issued in 8-K that you're -- you announced that you're expanding your change of control provisions to -- an additional component of the management team beyond the C-suite executives. Can you give us just a little bit of color, what that relates to and how common is it that you're modifying your change of control. David Turner : Yes, thank you for the question. I guess, we really did two things to -- both were intended to standardize, you can imagine with the truest announcement, there's a lot of concern about what our future is what our intentions are, a lot of questions about what may happen going forward. It caused us to look at our change of control agreements and because the bank was the combination of a lot of banks over a long period of time, what we quickly concluded was we had a fair amount of inconsistency in our agreements both with respect to change of control and severance. And so we asked our Board to consider a change in the or modifications to both change of control and severance, to make them more consistent, so they apply to both an appropriate group and they applied similarly to that group. And so it simply was the housecleaning sort of initiative for us to get everything in order. No real, significant change for our shareholders or frankly for our associates. But it does create some consistency. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Given your outlook for continued low to mid-single-digit loan growth and clearly, you laid out a very specific path for net interest margin. Is it too optimistic to think that net interest income could be flat next year? David Turner : Well, we don't want to give guidance yet on what next year is. We have -- still have things that we don't know about, what will the rate environment look like. Clearly, that puts pressure on growing net interest income, we do think that, we've talked a lot about being able to grow the balance sheet consistent with with GDP and then some, then a little. Now, we've also done a lot of capital recycling to make sure that we're getting good relationship business on the books. And so you've seen some pressure on absolute loan growth there. But we expect to grow, and our teams have that expectation. So we have that piece of it, we feel good about. Let's just see what the rate profit gives us going into next year. Lower rates obviously put some pressure on us. Erika Najarian : And as I think about your earlier response is clearly the ROTC range is potentially out of reach with given the interest rate outlook, but you did say you're not giving up on 55%. And as we think about the context of revenue challenges and potentially on that because of REITs and fees potentially peaking this year. I guess is there room for expenses on an absolute basis to actually be down if you get to continued efficiency improvement? David Turner : Well, so our commitment has been and continues to be generating positive operating leverage in any environment. So we are seeking to grow revenue faster than the expenses. So where revenue continues to be challenge, we will continue to work even harder on expense management, feel that we can do that. So I think that clearly revenue is going to be challenged, kind of back to the last part, the last question is revenue will be challenged because 65% of our revenue comes from spread, and we had higher rates in the first half of the year versus the back half. And so on a comp '19 to '20, it would be very hard to grow revenue in that at least NII. So loan growth, will help us there a bit. We'll see what the rate environment is, but we have good NIR, we have good investments that we've made, we expect that to continue to grow and as we just talked through our continuous improvement program to help and control expenses, we believe will generate positive operating leverage and continue to work our efficiency ratio down at the same time. Erika Najarian : And I just want to be clear, even in an environment that you mentioned where it's very hard to grow revenue, Regions is still committed to deliver positive operating leverage. David Turner : That's correct. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Couple of questions. First, more of a clarification, with the 25% to 30% deposit beta in the fourth quarter. Is that what's the denominator on that, is that on two cuts and hence it's a 12 basis point to 15 basis point reduction in deposit cost, it's not. I am just trying to make sure it's not on an average, the average fed funds rate because obviously you had July and September cut that's fully in the fourth quarter. I just want to make sure I understand the numerator and the denominator there. David Turner : So it's based on two rate cuts that are baked in in October and December right now. Saul Martinez : So it would be at the 12 basis point to 15 basis point reduction. David Turner : Round numbers, that's right. Saul Martinez : I guess more important question on loan growth, I hear what you're saying that under over the long run -- under normal conditions, you can grow your balance sheet in line with C&I -- and hopefully then some. But if I look at your loan growth this quarter period end it up I think 1% year-on-year. Going forward, do you have indirect vehicles rolling off to maybe a few hundred a quarter, you have GreenSky as a headwind. Home equity is still a little bit of a headwind, your CRE book isn't really growing. It's contracting. I think on mortgage owner occupied, how, I mean, I'm struggling with how you get loan growth and interest earning asset growth next year. Can you just help me understand where you see the offsets, where -- I know you're not giving guidance for 2020. But how do I think about it conceptually, given you have pretty material headwinds from in multiple loan lines. David Turner : So yes, there is a lot of stories inside the loan book. Let's kind of start at the top. So our big driver of loan growth has traditionally been our C&I book. Those can be lumpy from time to time. It depends on access to capital markets. It depends on line utilization, and you've seen some of that happen in this year. I mean it's, we had a lot of growth in the first quarter and no growth in the second, in the third quarter. We feel good about our pipelines, we feel good about our conversations. We're having with our -- with our clients, they are cautious, there're optimistic but they're watching this uncertainty with regards to trade and tariffs clearly put some pressure and downward sentiment in terms of wanting to make the next dollar fixed capital investment. But that being said, we still think there is going to be some growth there from an investor real estate standpoint we've probably have the second-lowest concentration of investor real estate of our peers, we have some opportunities there. We are being very careful and selective with clients. So from time to time, you'll see that move up and then pay-offs will move it back down, but I think investor real estate is an opportunity. Resi-mortgage continues to be an opportunity. We had a little bit of growth this quarter, production was up. About a third of that was refinanced and two-thirds of it was purchased. And we keep about almost half of what we, what we produce. So I think that'll be a plus in our direct consumer, we think it's going to be a plus. We making investments in unsecured even though GreenSky is running off, we have other avenues. I think John mentioned, we're going to cap unsecured, but we continue to see opportunities for a little bit of growth there. Now home equity has been on -- quite a bit of decline over time, and we think that that will slow down a bit. So I think that when you and you had mentioned indirect vehicles being down. Those are really the key drivers. Again, we're not looking for a lot of loan growth, but I think, we'll have solid loan growth that will be profitable for the Company. Saul Martinez : Can you remind the GreenSky is roughly $2 billion. And can you remind -- I believe and how quickly does it. What's the average, the weighted average life of that? David Turner : It's about $1.9 billion actually. It has little low right at two years in terms of duration. There will be pieces of this at linear for a while, but the bulk of that's two year. David Turner : And Saul while it's -- begins to run off. We've modestly increased our commitment to so far to grow that portfolio and we are investing in our own unsecured lending capabilities and we believe that we can match the timing of the run-off and the increase and so far with unsecured lending capabilities, all of which should help us on the consumer side in addition to growing mortgage, yearly bank card and growing direct lending. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us, we hear and you guys already touched on your technology spend. I think you had mentioned $625 million is what is expected to be expense this year. How can we as outsiders, we hear a lot of stories about the big banks taking market share from the smaller banks, how do you guys measure whether you're keeping -- I know the dollars you're spending, but how do you measure whether you're keeping up from a digital technological standpoint that you can remain competitive with the bigger banks. What are some of the metrics should we outsiders look to -- to determine whether you're keeping up with these bigger banks? John Owen : Yes, just real quick on that, this is John Owen. Like I said earlier, we spend about $625 million, about 42% of that is based on new initiatives and new projects and looking forward into new things which digital would be a big part of that, about 48% is around how we maintain the bank, maintain systems and really, our infrastructure going forward. About 10% is on cyber risk. The way we think about -- are we keeping up and keeping pace. We use a few external factors. Number one would be JD Powers -- JD Powers ranks all of the top 23 banks are on their list and they come out with a quarterly ranking and they rank everything from how we perform in the branch all the way through to our online banking and mobile banking. So that's a data point we use consistently. We are in the top quartile for branch and online, mobile moves between top quartile and second quartile. So again that's an area where we're trying to always keep that in the top quartile. The other source should be Gallup. Gallup also gives us good insights from our customers on how we're performing in digital and areas where we need to advance. The other thing I would point to is just the rapid growth of our digital at the bank. Over the last three years, our digital logins to our online and mobile properties were up 90%. You heard John talk about earlier on digital sales. Our digital sales are up 90% year-over-year. In credit card, our digital sales and savings accounts were up 35% and checking accounts, about 24%. So we kind of look at it from a couple of factors, how do our external parties validate what we're doing and also our internal growth rates. John Turner : Yes, I'll just add, Gerard. The other thing I look at it is, are we growing consumer checking accounts? Are we growing low cost deposits and who are our new customers? And roughly half of our new customers are under the age of 30. And so all of those things for me are indicators that we are in fact competing and having success, offering compelling technology to our customers. Gerard Cassidy : And David, you talked a bit about the CECL increase, you mentioned, you guys put out the number in the second quarter Q. I think you said $400 million to $600 million, which if you compare that to your existing level of reserves over a 50% increase. Everybody can -- appears to be able to handle yourself included the day one impact that you just described, how can you frame out for us. If you can what the day two impacts are going to look like? Should we as outsiders assume that we're going to see loan loss provisions of similar increases to what the day one impact was for everybody, or how are you guys looking at that at this stage? David Turner : I would not say that day two would be anything remotely close to day one. Day one just kind of level sets and we are -- we'll see what other peers are coming out and what their -- what their numbers are really is dependent on portfolios those with consumer or longer dated loans are going to have higher CECL charges than those that are business services oriented that have shorter-term duration of their loan books. Day two, you need to think about, you still have charge-offs that come through. You have to provide CECL reserves and provisioning on loan growth, those have a tendency to be somewhat higher than we have today. Under the incurred model and again, very dependent on what type of loans you're growing, so mix makes a big difference. So if you're growing mortgages versus commercial real estate, mortgages are going to carry a higher provision than commercial real estate as odd as that sounds. And then the last key factor is what's the economic outlook, how is that changing from time to time and that's why we put in our prepared comments, we've given you $400 million to $600 million, but is really dependent on what it looks like December 31/January 1, what do we think the -- the forecast looks like going forward. That makes a big difference in day two, when that change occurs things getting better or worse, you see in particular when they get worse or forecasted to get worse. You can see much bigger provisions than you do other than in current model and that's what the standard was supposed to do. It was trying to have your reserve much quicker. And that's why we've talked about pro-cyclicality of the standards is as pro-cyclical as you can get because in a down rate cycle, you're going to be reserving more for loan growth, which is -- which causes one to be concerned about the cost and availability of credit in a downturn. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous. Brian Foran : I guess I had a couple of questions on your slide appendix. First of all, thank you for this level of detail on the commercial loan portfolio or some of the key areas you're highlighting. It is quite a lot. I guess, as I look through Slide 14 or really maybe Slide 15 through Slide 17 because the energy you've talked about before. The restaurant, the retail, the manufacturing, transportation. How are you positioning this? Is this just being responsive to investor questions or are these areas you're actively concerned. Are there any sub portfolios where you seen opportunity to maybe take some market share. I guess how should I interpret all this detail why you're highlighting restaurant, retail, manufacturing and transportation? Barbara Godin : Brian, this is Barb Godin. On that note, we do have some concerns in the restaurant portfolio that we seeing some softening in the restaurant portfolio. There's certainly been some softening in the energy portfolio, a little bit manufacturing, but by and large, we decided to be much more transparent providing you with information on our portfolios, so that -- all of you have an opportunity to look and say, look, we see what's in their portfolio, we feel good about their portfolio, we feel good about our portfolios and our ability to manage it and we just felt that now was the time to be, as I said, much more transparent, particularly as we go into with potentially looks like a credit cycle that will happen in the next couple of years. Brian Foran : And then maybe in a similar vein on Slide 12. I mean, I almost hate to ask this, but it's always a little bit of a lightning rod for investors. The leverage loan balances certainly recognizing the $6 billion is a much bigger number than the standard definition of which would produce $2.5 billion, you highlight in the slides. But I think when you first gave this is about $5.5 billion. So why is it kind of crept up a little bit over the past six months to nine months, is that you participating more or is that just some credits tripping into your leverage definition. Why is the number gotten a little bigger? Barbara Godin : We do have a number of credits that again based on the way we define it, will become leverage even though they started off as not leveraged. Additionally, we've got Ronnie Smith here, who runs that portfolio and I'm going to ask him to make a couple of comments on it. Ronald Smith : Yes, just a couple of comments. And one of your responses is exactly on target. We had a couple of really long-term relationships publicly traded companies that had positive credit events that pushed it over into our definition of leverage lending and if you combine those two, it was just over $400 million. We feel good about those particular companies and we'll see at least one of those resolved within a very short period of time. The other will resolve given a little bit more intermediate period of time, but there is not really a focus on growing that portfolio, other than continuing to support our existing relationships where we can build broad and deep relationships outside of the lending transaction online. John Turner : I'd just add we actually manage it as a concentration risk like we do every other part of our portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : I wanted to ask further on the credit explanation that you just gave, should we see a higher level of total criticized than we do now or will that number kind of vary. I know you had the spec change driving a lot of this quarterly shifts? Barbara Godin : Yes, it's Barb again. In the criticized portfolio on particular classified, I think is what you're pointing to which drove that number up. So let me first start with saying, despite all that, our credit metrics for the quarter were within our broader risk expectation. We experienced improvement in several areas. As you know, delinquencies were down 4%, TDRs down 7%, NPLs down 13%, and charge-offs were flat. So we feel good there. And as well as you mentioned, David, did our Shared National Credits were included. And just to comment on the Shared National Credits, we weren't agent on any of those credits by the way. If I speak specifically to our classified loan category, I'm going to categorize what happened this quarter as follows, which is really over half of the increase came from five energy credits that moved into the category, but since quarter-end, one of these credits has totally resolved and the other three credits are to a large energy services customer, that's staying with us for well over 50 years and they have the proven ability to perform through the cycle. So for energy in general, I'll make the comment that our book right now was only 13% oilfield services and we also have gone through and have stressed our price deck on which we both lend as well as service our accounts down to $39.20. And that's against today's price, last I looked this morning. It was about $54 a barrel, give or take. So based on all of this and we've done a lot of work, we believe our energy losses will stay somewhere within a really manageable range of about $30 million to $50 million over the next year, in addition to energy -- next three year, sorry. In addition to energy, we also had some asset-based loans that we move to classified this quarter with all of them currently being well within their asset values. So as such, we anticipate minimal to no loss on those credits. And lastly, we also review the top 80% of credits that moved to our classified category this quarter and again based on this, we're comfortable both our loss range of 40 basis points to 50 basis points for this year and 40 basis points to 65 basis points over the next year based on a slowing economy. So I would summarize by saying, we don't see what happened this quarter as being a systemic issue, we are where we're coming off a period of historically low numbers and as such, we believe that some increase was to be expected. David Turner : I will add, Barbara. The 40 basis points to 65 basis points loss rate was over the next three years. Barbara Godin : Three years. I'm sorry. Christopher Marinac : Okay, great, that's helpful background. And again with the inclusion of the additional categories, does that imply that restaurants and ABL and others had deterioration in the quarter or again, you're just giving more transparency to those in general? Barbara Godin : There is some marginal deterioration, but we're really are just trying to get much more transparency. Operator : Your final question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Stephen Scouten : I just had a follow-up question maybe to Betsy's earlier question around the ROTCE guidance and kind of this -- maybe more specifically why that would move down, I just remember from your Investor Day, you guys had a pretty not negative, but maybe a muted view on the economy kind of where, GDP was going to go. Fed funds were roaring to a zero range policy and even the tenure, I think around $150 million. So granted a lot of what we're seeing today is kind of what you guys predicted. So I'm wondering, what specifically is driving the change in expectations relative to what you said that? David Turner : I think, Steven, our expectation of the tenure was closer to 3%, than the $150 million. At the time we gave that out. So there are two things that drive return is the numerator and denominator and that denominator impact on lower rates is pretty tough. When you have falling rate environment, clearly, the fair value of the investment portfolio and therefore book value increases and it's the same thing on all the derivatives that that we've added the fair value of those have obviously increased putting pressure on the denominator. So that's a -- that's more meaningful than you might think. When you go through the calculation from a net income standpoint, clearly, we had rate expectations and margin guidance that had been as high as 370, down to a low of 340. That's where we are. And so 18% to 20% wouldn't predicated on being at the low end of the range. So I think, if you look at our industry and you think of just good core commercial banking, at 20% return on capital can get -- you can get there when you have a rising rate environment margins are continuing to expand. We don't have that. We have low rates, a relatively flat yield curve and no -- at least the market saying, no real expectations for rates to change over the next couple of years. So it's really hammering out net income growth and return through making good investments to grow in IR, watching expenses, keeping tabs on credit quality. And that's what we're doing. But it's, it's, you can't get to those type of returns in this environment, if it persist. John Turner : Okay, since we have no further questions. So thank you all for your interest today. Appreciate it very much. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants' phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance and David Turner, will take you through an overview of the quarter. Earnings related documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our Web site. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the Q&A segment of today's call. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana. And thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. This morning we reported strong full year earnings from continuing operations of $1.5 billion, resulting in a 10% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. This year we also delivered the highest level of pre-tax pre-provision income in over a decade, while generating 4% positive operating leverage on a reported basis and 2% on an adjusted basis. Despite lower interest rates and significant market volatility, 2019 was a solid year and I'm proud of all that we accomplished. We continue to make progress on our goal of generating consistent, sustainable, long term performance through all phases of the economic cycle. Although market uncertainty continues, the economy is still growing. Our customers are optimistic about their businesses and consumer confidence remains healthy. We're also encouraged by progress made on the trade front. However, we will continue to monitor geopolitical tensions and the uncertainty they introduce. As we begin the New Year, we have solid momentum and feel good about how we're positioned. We have a comprehensive hedging strategy in place to protect net interest income, so we don't have to stretch for loan growth. Our core businesses continue to produce good results, generating growth in consumer checking accounts and households, credit cards and wealth assets under management. We're very pleased with the performance of our priority markets, and investments in our businesses continue to pay off. We have a robust credit-risk management framework. And while asset quality continues to normalize, overall, it remains pretty benign. And finally, although, we've made significant progress through simplify and grow we're only one-third complete with our current list of identified initiatives. There are lot of process improvements and revenue-generating opportunities left. We continue to leverage digital across our omni-channel platform to better meet customer needs and improve efficiency and effectiveness. A few quick examples. Full year checking account and credit card production increased 17% and 65% respectively. Loan applications increased 54% and in mortgage, approximately 60% of all applications are completed online. Mobile deposits increased 52% and now represent 13% of all deposits. As we look forward, we're focused on the things we can control, meet the needs of our customers with best-in-class service while leveraging technology and making banking easier for our associates and customers. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business, generating positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management and prudent investment decisions, our priority center on soundness, profitability and growth in that order. Thank you for your time and attention, this morning. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to thank the 19,000 plus associates here at Regions for their commitment and dedication throughout 2019. Because of this team, I'm confident about 2020 and feel good about our plans, which support delivering consistent, sustainable results through all phases of the economic cycle. Dave? David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with balance sheet. Adjusted average total loans decreased less than 1%, while ending loans increased modestly. Adjusted average consumer loans increased 1%, led by increases in indirect to other, credit card and mortgage, partially offset by declines in home equity. Average business loans decreased 1% and were impacted by our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability, as well as lower line utilization and elevated pay down activity during the quarter. We continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and are not interested in pursuing nominal loan growth for short-term benefit. That said we expect full year 2020 average loan balances to remain relatively stable on a reported basis and to grow in the low single-digit on an adjusted basis. Similar to 2019, we expect 2020 loan growth to be led by business services lending specifically C&I loan with modest growth in owner-occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate. Within consumer lending, we expect growth in residential mortgage, indirect to other, card and direct lending. Turning to average deposits. Reflecting seasonal trends, average corporate segment deposits increased 4%. Average wealth segment deposits increased 1%, while average consumer segment deposits remained relatively stable. Of note, total non-interest bearing deposit grew 1.5% during the quarter. Deposit growth in the business segments was partially offset by 51% decline in other segment deposits due primarily to reductions within wholesale corporate treasury deposit categories, reflective of a lower need for wholesale borrowings. So let's look at how this impacted net interest income and margin. Net interest income declined 2% linked quarter and net interest margin declined 5 basis points to 3.39%. Net interest margin and net interest income are negatively impacted by lower market interest rates. However, this was partially offset by declining deposit costs and a more favorable funding mix. Lower loan balances reduced net interest income but benefited net interest margin. With respect to funding, we completed a cash tender offer during the quarter for approximately two thirds of our outstanding 3.2% parent company senior notes incurring $16 million in extinguishment costs. The estimated run rate benefit in 2020 is an increase to annual net interest income of approximately $15 million and a 1 to 2 basis point improvement in margin. As expected, total deposit cost declined 8 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 41 basis points and interest bearing deposit costs declined 13 basis points to 64 basis points. The associated deposit beta was 28% this quarter. Regions continue to deliver industry leading performance in this space, exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise. Assuming a stable rate environment, we expect modest reductions in deposit costs moving forward. Now that the majority of our forward starting hedges have begun, our balance sheet is largely insulated from movement in short term rates, and additional hedging and securities repositioning have reduced roughly half of our sensitivity to longer term rates. $4.5 million of forward starting hedges were added during the quarter, aimed at locking in a portion of 2020 fixed rate originations. Looking ahead, during the first quarter, we expect the margins to expand in the low 340s as the benefits of our hedging strategy begin. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expenses. Adjusted non-interest income increased 1% compared to the third quarter, led by growth in capital markets, wealth management and service charges. Capital markets experienced a record quarter, driven by growth across most categories; notably, M&A advisory, loan syndication and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers. Commercial swap income also benefited from favorable CVA adjustments during the quarter. Although mortgage income decreased compared to the prior quarter, results remain strong despite seasonally lower production, as well as less favorable hedging and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. For the full year, mortgage was a significant contributor to non-interest income growth, increasing 19%. Other non-interest income declined this quarter, driven primarily by product valuation adjustments to certain equity investments in the prior quarter that did not repeat at the same level. Let's move on to the non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses remained well controlled, increasing slightly compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher salaries and benefits, marketing and professional fees. Salaries and benefits increased modestly, driven by higher production based incentives. The increase in marketing expense was driven primarily by additional campaigns targeting priority markets, while professional fees reflected the timing of legal and consulting costs. The Company's fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.1%, and the effective tax rate was 20.3%. As John mentioned, we continue to benefit from our continuous improvement process as we are only one-third complete with our current list of identified initiatives, several of which are exceeding our initial expectations. For example, at Investor Day, we committed to reducing our total square footage by 2.1 million square feet and our third-party spin by $60 million to $65 million by 2021. We also disclosed plans to consolidate 100 branches during that same period. Based on the progress we made in 2019, we are on track to exceed our targets related to square footage and third-party spend reductions, as well as branch consolidations. We're now targeting third-party spin reductions in the $80 million to $85 million range and we will continue to look for opportunities to pull forward or expand on initiatives where we can. For 2020, we recognize revenue growth will be challenging. However, we remain committed to achieving full year adjusted positive operating leverage. While our hedging strategy helps mitigate the risk from lower rates, full year growth and net interest income will be difficult. We have good momentum in growing non-interest revenue, which we expect to continue. So while total revenue growth may be modest, we will continue to lean into expenses and the opportunities identified through simplifying growth; all the while continuing to make prudent investments to drive revenue growth. We'll again spin approximately $625 million on technology in 2020. We expect to open approximately 20 new branches and we will continue to hire talented bankers across our businesses. With respect to the effective tax rate, we expect the full year 2020 range to be 20% to 22%. So let's shift to asset quality. Overall, credit results remained in line with our risk expectations during the quarter. We saw improvement in several categories while experiencing some normalization in others. Net charge-offs were 46 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, in line with our expected range of 40 basis points to 50 basis points for 2019. Provision equal net charge-offs, resulting in allowance equal to 1.05% of total loans and 171% of total non-approval loans. Non-performing loans increased 10%, primarily attributable to a single credit within the waste management industry, which we expect will be resolved over the next several quarters. Delinquencies and troubled debt restructured loans remain stable quarter-over-quarter, while business services' criticized loans decreased 3%. For 2020, we expect full year net charge-offs between 45 basis points and 55 basis points. Let me comment briefly on CECL. We continue to finalize our day-one impact assumptions and expect the impact to be in the $500 million to $530 million range. So let's take a look at capital and liquidity. During the quarter the Company repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for $132 million and declared $149 million in common dividends. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 9.6%, in-line with our target level of 9.5%. The loan deposit ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 85%. The next slide reflects 2019 performance against our targets. And we've also provided you with a summary of full year 2020 expectations. Wrapping things up, in light of the challenging and changing economic backdrop, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial results. We have a solid strategic plan, designed to deliver consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle. With that, we're happy to take your questions. But do ask that each caller ask only one question to allow for more callers. We'll open line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : So we hear you loud and clear, and I think your investors appreciate your continued discipline in loan underwriting. I think you alluded to, in previous calls, potential wholesale consumer strategies to offset some of the GreenSky runoff. I mean I know you listed the categories, David, during your prepared remarks. But maybe dive a little bit into detail about some of the consumer strategy? And could there be a potential wholesale strategy? And again, I'm not asking if you're buying a depository in terms of obtaining portfolios or accelerating partnerships to deploy your loan to deposit ratio of 85%? David Turner : So as we mentioned in the prepared comments, the growth will -- we should experience actually be more in the business services side. On the consumer side, we're going to continue to have our runoff of our indirect auto portfolio that will put pressure on total balances. We have made some shift in terms of our indirect to other consumer you saw that in the fourth quarter. That'll continue somewhat in the first part of the year, and then we kind of get to our concentration limit after the first quarter or so. So you shouldn't see that continue to grow at the same pace that you saw it in the fourth quarter throughout the year. We are going to continue to grow residential mortgage. We are going to continue to grow our credit card book some as well, those will be the big drivers of consumer. But net-net, total consumer will be relatively stable if you carve out the runoff portfolio. So the growth that we're trying to send the message really is going to come in primarily in the C&I area. John Turner : But Erika, I would say, we are actively observing what's going on in the market, looking for opportunities. We're evaluating different opportunities that may come along. Clearly, we shifted our exposure from the GreenSky relationship to increasing our exposure through SoFi that is largely result the fact that SoFi as originating loans directly to consumers versus indirectly, which was GreenSky model, we like that better. We're learning more about SoFi and the portfolio that we have. And I think you can expect us to continue explore ways, other ways to grow consumer loans over the next year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Jennifer Demba : You raised your net charge-off guidance slightly for 2020 versus '19. Just wondering kind of what's driving that? Is it more conservatism? Or are you seeing some underlying weakness in any service portfolios? Thanks. David Turner : Jennifer, this is David. So we had 40 to 50 basis points last year. We've raised it slightly 45 to 55, acknowledging couple of different things. One, if you look at last couple of quarters, we're at 44 and 46. We also see some normalization of credit, especially on the consumer side. We also, as Erika just mentioned, some shift in terms of consumer lending into other higher loss categories. We feel good about that, because we're getting paid for the risk that we take. But if you're just looking at the charge off number in isolation, it will be up perhaps slightly. So we didn't think that -- that's really not signalling any broad deterioration in credit whatsoever. Operator : The next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I was wondering if you can follow up the CECL discussion and help us understand how you're starting to think about the day two impacts, especially given some of the moving parts of your ins and outs on the consumer portfolio side in your already high 1.7-ish looks like pro forma reserve to loans ratio. But do you think you'll have to meaningfully build as you go forward and how do you start to help us understand that? Thank you. David Turner : Yes, I think the best way -- so when you see what everybody else comes up within CECL clearly, the type of lending that you have your portfolio mix makes a big difference. Consumer long-dated assets, duration assets have a much higher CECL reserve to that. As you think about CECL for day two, the first thing you ought to think about is what's the charge off expectations and Jennifer just brought that up from that, then you look at loan growth. What we told you was, on an absolute basis, our loans would be flat on an adjusted basis, they would be up a bit, so not a lot of change there. Then you have to think through the mix, what are you growing versus what's running off. And so we'll give you some better clarity on that at a later day. So we don't see a big change in CECL this particular year, because we don't currently forecast a change in the economic outlook. And that's something that all of us need to be aware of is when you forecast the change in economic outlook, they can cause a little bit of volatility in provisioning. So those are really the key pieces that I think you should consider as you try to model the provision for next year. Operator : The next question is from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : You guys had a good year on the core fee income growth that's up just about 6%. Do you think mid single digit growth is going to be sustainable in 2020? And just if you could talk about some of the businesses where you see some of the better growth? David Turner : Yes. So Peter, we were very pleased with our growth in the year for non-interest revenue, in particular in the fourth quarter. If you take our top three categories, those were really driven by continued growth in customers. So growing customer checking accounts, growing operating accounts, growing customers from the wealth standpoint, those were critically important to us and we feel good about that. We've hired additional personnel during 2019. It will help us to continue to grow customer accounts. As you look at mortgage, mortgage had a really good year this year. It will be hard to repeat that for all of 2020, but mortgage will be a big contributor to non-interest revenue and we feel good about where we are there. Capital markets had a really strong fourth quarter. We've mentioned to you before that that business has been about $45 million to $55 million revenue per quarter business. We think that that number is really in the kind of $50 million to $60 million business for us now. So we think relative to 2019, capital markets should have some nice growth. It got off to a pretty slow start in '19. We think it's going to get out to nice start in '20 based on the backlog of business that we see. So when you add that all up, we have pretty good confidence that we're going to have nice growth in non-interest revenue. And frankly, that is one of the key drivers of why we're committed to, and believe we will generate positive operating leverage in a challenging rate environment for 2020. Peter Winter : And just one quick follow-up. You guys have done also a good job in controlling the deposit costs with higher rates, and we've seen deposit costs coming down already with the cut in rates. So I'm just wondering of total deposit costs of 41 basis points, is there much room left to lower deposit cost? David Turner : Out beta for this past quarter was about 28%, that's a little lower than our cumulative beta. And our cumulative beta is about 27% this down cycle. And that's slightly below what saw in the upgrade cycle. And as a result of that, we think there's -- if we stay flat here and there's no movement, which we don't expect much movement from the Fed, we would continue to have deposit costs come down some more, probably not at the rate that you've seen. But I think there is incremental continued benefit there. And again, that's part of our margin guidance that we've given you too that we think the margin can expand along with the hedging program that we have that margin would expand a bit in 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Conour: I know there're some kind of drags to loan growth in, call it the near-term here, and I think the de-risking you guys have been very consistent and it's been well received. I guess my question is like, if we look more medium-term and think about the type of loan growth that you should have, the type of deposit growth that you should have considering the market, like what's reasonable levels, again beyond 2020 just thinking? And the reason I am asking is I just -- I feel like the balance sheet growth has been less than most of us will expect given your economies, given your markets. But I'm also appreciative of the de-risking and call it the focus on the profitability, which has helped them free up some capital. But maybe talk about the medium term outlook for those two areas. Thank you. David Turner : So Matt, we have been extremely deliberate in allocating capital to those relationships to give us a appropriate risk adjusted return, because at the end of the day that's what we think really is what our investors want us to do with the capital, not just to grow but to grow appropriately, to grow with the right return. And just an example, this year we recycled $2 billion worth of credit out of our Corporate Banking Group that we could have had. We could add an additional $2 billion for the loan growth. It has been a suboptimal return. These are customers that we seek to sell and offer more of our banking services. So we had a full relationship with great returns. And when we can't get back, when it comes up for renewal, we let it go. And so we're going to stick to that. Now that being said, as you think about loan growth for us for the short and long term, is we should be GDP plus a little bit. Our expectation for GDP this coming year is of slightly under 2%, as a matter of fact, its 1.8 in our estimate. So we have low single digits loan growth expectations for, on an adjusted basis, for 2020. And it's because if we try to push too hard past GDP, we think you make a bad credit decision. So we're going to be incredibly disciplined. We realized we need to grow. We're all about that, growing earnings, growing revenue and return. And so it's all of the delicate balance and how we do that appropriately. Matt O'Connor: And just any guess on, relative to kind of industry growth or GDP growth, as you think about medium term kinds of loan to deposit growth rates? John Turner : Well, I'd say that we said consistently that we and David reiterated this that we want to grow with the economy plus a little, recognizing that while the markets we're in are good growth markets. They're also markets that historically have demonstrated a fair amount of volatility. And so it's important to us that we stay disciplined, as David said, focused on appropriate allocation of capital and we think growing with the economy plus a little is the right place for us medium term and longer term. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy at RBC. John Turner : Good morning Gerard. Gerard you might be on mute. Okay, why don't we go to the next question, we lost Gerard. Operator : Your next question is for Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : I guess a follow-up question on CECL. As Ken mentioned, your ACL ratio moves up with your day-one impact of over 1.7%, which seems pretty high given the risk profile of your loan book and the composition of your loan book. The only banks who -- very few banks who have given day-one impacts are above that level unless they have much more consumer oriented exposure. And I know a lot of things go into it. I know you have more term loans in your C&I book, for example. \u2026 for example. But I mean, I guess how conservative do you think that estimate is? And if I look forward to the day two impact and you think about what you said, David, on mix it would seem -- how do I think about the loss content of what's coming on your books versus what's getting paid off? Because it would seem, given your de-risking that that 1.7 reserve ratio could trend lower going forward? Or is that too aggressive of a comment or an expectation? David Turner : Well, yes, a few questions to that. Let me see if I can break it down. So the 170 relative to others, you really -- the mix is hugely important. I suspect when we get to providing more granular disclosures by loan type and breaking that down so that you will have a better gauge as to what new production would cost and what benefits you might get for run off of loan portfolio. So we don't -- we tried to get this right. We've tightened up the range quite a bit 500 and 530. That's again to our 1.1% reserve today, which includes the reserve for unfunded commitments to 1.70. So I think that you're going to need some incremental disclosures to help you on a go forward basis, we'll be providing that to you at a later point. But we think the reserve that we have for CECL is pretty appropriate, and we didn't do anything to be overly conservative or otherwise. We just did what we thought the standard call for we're moving forward. We'll all learn a little bit from each other as we go through the year. And we'll be making decisions on how that might affect our business, and production, and pricing going forward. Saul Martinez : And I guess just following up, like in terms of how you'd be thinking about provisions going forward. Should we be thinking that 1.7 lifetime ratio is sort of appropriate and we should be provisioning to maintain that level of reserve ratio going forward? David Turner : Yes, I think for the time being as I was trying to get to that point earlier, is if you think about provisioning for 2020, the first thing you ought to think about is what's your charge-off expectations for us next year. Then what is the loan growth, net loan growth expectation for us next year. We've given you guidance that says our net loans will be flat. We'll grow on an adjusted basis but we have our run off of our vehicle portfolio that will be working against balances there. And then your third -- and so the third component would be what are you growing. The mix makes a difference and we'll give you some more granular data later to help you there. And then what's your expectation of the economic outlook from quarter-to-quarter. And that could be -- that could change. And we think the economy is going to be fairly stable this year, that's our going in thought, but that can change. And so those are the roughly four pieces that you need to have in terms of projecting CECL provisioning. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Regarding your expectation for positive operating leverage in 2020, can you help size up the magnitude or maybe give us just a little bit more color around it regarding the components. And then also why not provide more detailed outlook around '20? You previously have given full year expense growth and full year revenue targets. What's different about this year that you're not giving that? David Turner : Well, let say if I can help you there. So let's take that big component. So NII, which is two-thirds of our revenue, it'd be very hard to grow that this year with the low single digit loan growth on adjusted basis that we have given you and that's just a mere rate play. The first half of '19, rates being up off the December '18 rate increase would be hard to replicate. And then for the other third of our revenue, NII, we've given you a little bit of guidance in terms of what you can model. We feel good about that growth. From an expense standpoint, we said we'd be very relatively stable, from an expense standpoint. And if you add all three of those up, we will generate positive operating leverage. So I think we've been reasonably explicit in terms of how do we get there being with the numbers from that standpoint. John Pancari : And then just to confirm on what you just said that relatively stable expectation for 2020 expenses. Did that already factors in your IT investments and what you're doing on the core systems front? David Turner : Absolutely\u2026 John Turner : Yes, I would underscore the point, John. That includes our continued investments in talent, in markets and in technology. We're not adjusting our budgets at all and we believe we can continue to deliver stable expenses year-over-year. Operator : Your final question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I'm going to ask the capital question, I know I always do on this call. But I did want to understand how you're thinking about capital utilization, not only in your base case assumption where you've got net loan growth flat in total but in an environment where things -- actually loan growth accelerates a little bit more. Maybe you could give us a sense as to -- do we just hold with this what I would consider little bit of excess capital, or is the pipeline of bolt-ons robust enough to use some of this? Or do we anticipate a little bit more buyback this year? Thanks. David Turner : So it's always a good question on capital. Just to reiterate how we think about utilization of the capital we generated. So first off, we're getting close to our target we laid out 9.6% common equity Tier 1 today estimated on our current target of 9.5%. As we've mentioned before that has 50 basis points of the management buffer our quantitative calculations that would lead us to believe we need about 9% common equity Tier 1. As we think about, first and foremost, our capital is there for us to grow appropriately, organically, in particular. And so we have low single digit loan growth expectations and you can do some quick math and see we'll use a little bit of capital from that standpoint. We've targeted that 35% to 45% of our earnings to go and be paid to our shareholders in the form of a dividend, so you have that piece. We have from time-to-time done some bolt-on acquisitions, those use capital than been today have done, but it's certainly something. If we see opportunity, John just talked about we look at different things from time-to-time. And if we can deploy that capital in a meaningful manner that helps us grow our long term business, we'll do so. And then frankly, the last thing we do is share repurchases. We are crazy about doing share repurchases but we also don't want to continue to have excess capital. So if we can't deploy it in a meaningful manner through organic loan growth, bolt-on acquisitions then we'll give that back to the shareholder in the form of share repurchases like we've done this past several years. So I think those are the pieces that you need to have. Betsy Graseck : Is there anything on the bolt-on front, I mean, you had a nice pace over the past year or so, and I know you mentioned the fee outlook several times. So is the fee outlook with the current footprint that you have, or does the fee outlook -- could the fee outlook be enhanced by incremental acquisitions, if you could speak a little bit to that? John Turner : I mean, we continue to look at opportunities, whether it'd be investments in capital markets capabilities, wealth management, buying more servicing rights, not a great time to do that today, but we're still looking. There are other capabilities, potentially that we have some interest and we look at loan portfolios from time-to-time. And those are things that we'll continue to do, as we think about how we invest in the excess capital we have in other parts of our business that will help us grow over time. Operator : And your next question is for Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us, you've done a really good job over the last three years or so on being very conservative in your underwriting standards. And of course, that's resulted in more modest loan growth than some of your peers. And I'm not asking you to comment on your peers' underwriting standards, but can you just give us some color in commercial C&I that is in commercial real estate. What kind of underwriting are you guys seeing that you're just not comfortable with that may be some of your peers are? John Turner : I'll ask Ronnie Smith, who has our corporate banking group to respond, Gerard. Ronnie Smith : You know and you may have heard this earlier, but we are really focused back in on the relationship side of things, Gerard, simply because we believe that when you have a broad and a deep relationship, you become more meaningful to that client and it gives you the ability to weather through whatever storms might be out there when you are meaningful to them, have the opportunity to get in early. And really client selectivity on the front side is so important. But understanding the complete flow of business that they have the complete demand that they have for banking services is really where we try to be focused. And I would also say that we look historically at how well companies have gone through the cycles, really strongly leaned into the management, their capability, how they performed through the last cycle and of course use the standard underwritings that I won't go into the details around that today. But those are the high level pieces of how we try to look at the risk that we take on when we go through client selectivity. John Turner : The only thing I would add to that is that specifically to your question, I think what I most consistently hear from bankers is loan to value. So our willingness to provide as much capital as a customer may want -- it tends to be the differentiator. As an example, we may want to own 60% loan to value on our project than the customers can get 65% or 70% from someone else. So that's a function of variety of factors but it tends to be the most significant differentiator is in today's marketplace. Dana Nolan : Gerard, I would also add that we stay very, very close to our customers. Our people in the field do an excellent job of that and we are touching basis with them sometimes on a weekly basis, but often monthly, certainly quarterly, and making sure that if there is any early warning signs of any risks that are there that we're on top of it early. Because as you know, if you want to get on top of a problem early, you've got a lot more solutions you can give and then you have to wait until there's nothing left to do but to exit the relationship. Gerard Cassidy : And then just as a follow-up question. Obviously, you are one of the so called extended cycle banks, so you will be going through a full CCAR this year. David, are you expecting any differences between this year and what you did last year? Last year, obviously, you didn't go through it being in an extended cycle bank. Should we expect any kind of differences? David Turner : Yes, Gerard, we kind of go through stress test all time internally, it's just this is one that we have to fill out form and go through the review process with our regulatory supervisors. And we are awaiting the instructions for that and we're looking to see if there are any changes. There's an article I think this morning or yesterday, I can't remember in the banker, regarding expectations for some changes in CCGR for this year. Things like if you are in stress, do you have to continue with anticipated share repurchases at the same pace in a stress environment. I mean, that's something we would not do. So we are hoping that gets changed in the rules, or would we continue to grow the portfolio at the same pace that we are now if we're in the stressed environment. So those are the two pretty big and important things that we're hoping might get changed in the rules. But other than that, understanding what losses are, I mean, this is a good exercise for the industry for us individually and for our regulatory supervisors. And so, we are ready to go and we will be submitting that plan in first part of April. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to John Turner for closing remarks. John Turner : So I'll close by again thanking our 19,000 plus associates for all their efforts in 2019 on behalf of our customers. And thank you all who participated in the call today for the interest in our company. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Shelby, and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide some high level commentary and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. Earnings-related documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments as well as the Q&A segment of today's call. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and thank you all for joining our call today. I want to begin the call today by thanking our 19,000 associates, who despite tremendous disruption in their personal and professional lives continue to come together as a team to support each other, our customers and communities through the COVID-19 pandemic. The last few weeks have certainly been challenging. However, our top priority is the health and wellbeing of our associates and customers. In order to do our part to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we were one of the first banks to limit in-person branch activity to our drive-throughs and converted office services to appointment only. We also reopened previously closed locations to better serve our customers. Fortunately, due to our footprint, the majority of our branches have drive-through capabilities and I'm proud that we've been able to keep 97% of our branches open during this time. Additionally, almost half of our associates are now working remotely. Our teams remain committed to delivering the financial advice and guidance our customers have come to expect from the Regions\u2019 bankers. These changes will help us do so in a way that minimizes the associated health risks. We're offering special financial assistance to support our customers who are experiencing financial hardships related to the pandemic. Through Tuesday, we have processed approximately 17,000 consumer payment deferral request, including approximately 4,000 related to residential mortgages. In addition, we've processed requests for approximately 12,000 mortgage loans serviced for others. From a business customer perspective, we've processed approximately 4,000 more. Also as a certified SBA lender, we've been working very hard to help customers through the new Paycheck Protection Program. And I'm proud to say that through yesterday, we have facilitated assistance to our business customers totaling $2.8 billion. We recognize the importance to our customers and their employees of access to fund through this program. In the span of 8 days, we established a cross functional team to create an end-to-end digital application, build automation around every feasible point in the process, reassign several hundred staff from other departments and train them to accept and process loan applications for small business owners. We're hopeful Congress will appropriate additional funds as significant need remains. Importantly, the bank also continued to lend to customers outside of the stimulus programs. During the quarter, new and renewed loan originations to business customers totaled just over $10 billion. Further through the bank and our foundation, we've committed approximately $5 million toward consumer and small business recovery efforts. We're also donating advertising time, originally purchased for promoting bank products and services, to food banks across our footprints. These advertisements encourage viewers to financially support food banks as they strive to help those in need. As we navigate through this crisis, our teams will continue to come together to identify innovative and meaningful ways to better connect with us and serve our customers. For some time now, we have communicated our goal of generating consistent, sustainable long-term performance through every economic cycle. All of our plans were built around this concept. Because of our focus and the deliberate steps we have taken, we entered these challenging times from a position of strength, underpinned by a robust capital and liquidity. This will allow us to better support our customers as we work together to get through this unprecedented time in our history. We will incur some stress that's just a result of the economy we're in as we combat this public health crisis. But unlike the crisis, the financial services industry experienced a decade ago, we are providing solutions to meet the needs of our customers during this extraordinary time. We have spent decades strengthening our capital position and risk management framework through an intense focus on risk adjusted returns, client selectivity, and robust concentration risk management, we have built a more balanced and diverse portfolio. Our strong capital and liquidity positions combined with extensive de-risking efforts, has given us confidence that we can weather the pressure from the abrupt economic slowdown. In addition, two years ago, we initiated a significant hedging strategy to reduce net interest income variability and protect us from the impacts of a lower interest rate environment. The benefit from our hedging strategy provides us with a substantial competitive advantage in the current low rate environment. All of this allows us to move forward confidently and remain focused on the things we can control, providing support to our associates and communities and offering first-class advice, guidance, and education to our customers. Although we're at a time of significant economic stress, it's too soon to estimate its duration or severity. We are encouraged by the actions taken by government and bank regulators to provide relief to individuals and small businesses while also supporting the smooth functioning of the financial markets. In light of this uncertainty, we are resending our financial targets for this year along with our three-year targets previously announced in 2019. We remain committed to our strategic plan but acknowledge the need to remain flexible during this time of unprecedented and historic uncertainty. We will provide updates with respect to our financial targets once conditions stabilize and we'd have better visibility. We adopted the concept of shared value several years ago whereby what we do as a business must create long-term value for customers, communities, associates and shareholders. Frankly, I'm convinced that it has never been more important as we work through the current health crisis together with our customers and communities. Thank you for your time and attention this morning. With that I'll now turn it over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with our quarterly highlights. First quarter net income totalled, $139 million resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.14. Items impacting our results this quarter includes a significant CECL provision in excess of net charge offs and a large increase to our CVA associated with customer derivatives as interest rates move down substantially during the quarter and credit spreads widen. Partially offsetting the negative adjustments our MSR, net of hedges performed favorably during the quarter. In total, the adjusted and additional selected items highlighted on the slide reduced our pretax results by approximately $280 million. Let's take a look at our results starting with the balance sheet. Adjusted the average loans increased 1% while adjusted ending loans increased 7%. Loan growth was driven primarily by elevated commercial draw activity late in the quarter. Utilization rates increased from 45% at the end of the year to 54% at the end of March. As a point of reference, our utilization rate is typically around 45% and during the global financial crisis peaked around 51%. In the last week of the quarter the pace of increase slowed and we expect utilization rates will remain relatively stable for the time being. The draws we experienced have been primarily defensive or cautionary in nature and are broad based geographically and across all industries. Approximately 60% have come from investment grade companies, so we anticipate a portion of these customers will eventually seek permanent financing through the capital markets. However, it is too early to try and predict the timing of any refinancing. As a result, predicting loan growth is challenging. However, I do want to remind you that on April 1, we closed our purchase of Ascentium capital, which included approximately $2 billion in loans to small businesses. We look forward to leveraging the technology, speed and convenience that Ascentium is known for in combination with our broad spectrum of banking solutions to meet the needs of small businesses during this difficult time. Let's turn to deposits. Average deposits increased 1%, while ending deposits increased 3% as many of our corporate customers drawing on their lines are keeping that excess cash in their deposit accounts. We expect these balances will come down over time as customers secure financing in the capital markets, or customers get more clarity regarding the economic impact of the health crisis. As we have experienced in previous periods of stress, consumer deposits increased as customers seek the safety and soundness of a regulated and insured financial institution. We expect total deposits will continue to increase both at regions and across the industry. On an ending basis, corporate segment deposits increased 8%, while wealth and consumer segment deposits each increased 3%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the wholesale broker deposits within the other segment. Shifting to net interest income and margin, which is a strong story for regions. Net interest income increased 1% linked quarter and net interest margin increased five basis points to 3.44%. As expected net interest income and that interest margin have been a source of stability under an extremely volatile market interest rate backdrop. Specifically, lower loan yields were offset by lower funding cost and the benefit of forward starting hedges becoming active in the quarter. Now that most of our forward starting hedges have begun and given our ability to move deposit costs lower, our balance sheet is largely insulated from movement in short term rates. Loan hedges added $10 million to net interest income and four basis points to the margin in the quarter. This will increase going forward as the benefits are realized for the entirety of future quarters. Further, all of our hedges have five-year tenors and a quarter end market valuation of $1.7 billion, another relative differentiator. Of note, net interest income was supported in March as LIBOR rates remained elevated at a time when other short term rates indices, which are our large driver of deposit cost, moved close to zero. The benefit of elevated LIBOR is projected to normalize by midyear. Additionally, higher average loan balances increased net interest income, but reduced net interest margin, while one fewer day in the quarter reduced net interest income, but increased net interest margin. Total deposit costs declined six basis points compared to the prior quarter to 35 basis points and interest-bearing deposit cost declined 9 basis points to 55 basis points. Regions continues to deliver industry-leading performance in this space, exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise. Over the coming quarters, we expect deposit cost to migrate back down into the 10 to 14 basis point range. Looking ahead to the second quarter, let me start by saying these expectations exclude the potential impact from the Fed\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, but are too uncertain to include in the forecast at this time. We expect second quarter net interest income and net interest margin to benefit from the Ascentium Capital acquisition. Net interest margin is anticipated at roughly 3.4%. Excluding Ascentium, a larger, average balance sheet in the near term is anticipated, given increased loan and liquidity needs from our customers. While this will benefit net interest income, it will slightly reduce net interest margin. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expenses. Almost all non-interest revenue categories were impacted by market volatility and economic uncertainty, resulting in a 14% decrease compared to the prior quarter. After experiencing a record quarter in the fourth quarter, capital markets revenue decreased to $9 million. Excluding unfavorable CVA, capital markets income totaled $43 million. We generated record customer derivatives income in connection with lower interest rates, but experienced decreases across all other categories. Looking forward, M&A transactions, in particular, are likely to remain on hold until markets stabilize and the economic outlook becomes more certain. Mortgage income increased 39% over the fourth quarter, driven primarily by elevated sales and record application volumes associated with the favorable rate environment, as well as positive net hedge performance on mortgage servicing rights. Lower interest rates sparked a significant increase in year-over-year production. In fact, our first quarter total application volume was more than double our historical first quarter average. Wealth management revenue remained stable despite market volatility. If market conditions persist, however, we could experience a decline next quarter in line with lower asset values. Service charge revenue and card and ATM fees decreased 5% and 6%, respectively. During the last two weeks of the quarter, we observed a reduction of approximately 30% in consumer spending activity. Looking forward, if current spend levels persist, we estimate total consumer noninterest income will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $25 million per month from pre-March levels. Partially offsetting these headwinds, however, our positive revisions to anticipated mortgage income resulting from lower interest rates. Mortgage production increased 60% compared to the first quarter of the prior year and pipelines are strong. Full year 2020 production is expected to increase by approximately 40% versus the prior year. Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses remained well controlled, decreasing 5% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower salaries and benefits, professional fees and marketing expenses. Salaries and benefits decreased 4% driven by lower production-based incentives and negative market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, which are offset by lower noninterest income. Professional fees decreased 36% driven primarily by elevated legal, consulting and professional fees in the fourth quarter. The company's first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.9%, and the effective tax rate was 20.6%. We continue to benefit from continuous improvement processes as we have completed only 40% of our current list of identified initiatives. For example, since the first quarter of last year, we have reduced total corporate space by almost 900,000 square feet or 7%. While it's still early, the pandemic is already having an impact on how we interact and communicate with customers and each other. We've already initiated changes and in many instances are discovering that not all change is bad. For example, we have wealth teams calling on and winning business using Webex and video conferencing in effective and dynamic ways. Whether it's through new ways to interact with customers or increased use of hoteling, we believe there are additional opportunities where corporate space is concerned. So we are going to keep our minds open as we navigate through this disruption. So let's shift to asset quality. We adopted the CECL accounting standard as of January 1, 2020. As permitted by the Federal Reserve, we will defer the impact from the CECL accounting standard on common equity Tier 1 capital each quarter until the end of 2021, after which it will be phased in at 25% per year. As of March 31, this amount is approximately $440 million and represents all of our day 1 after tax adjustment recorded directly as a reduction of shareholders' equity on January 1 as well as 25% of our first quarter provision in excess of net charge-offs. The related impact to our first quarter common equity Tier 1 ratio is approximately 40 basis points. Under CECL, credit loss provision expense for the quarter totaled $373 million. This amount includes providing for $123 million in net charge-offs as well as $250 million of additional provision, reflecting adverse economic conditions and significant uncertainty within the economic forecast, including uncertainty surrounding the benefits of government stimulus already enacted and potential additional stimulus, all occurring since the initial assessment at adoption on January 1, 2020. The additional provision was further impacted by higher specific reserves associated with downgrades primarily in the energy and restaurant portfolios. The resulting allowance for credit losses is 1.89% of total loans and 261% of total nonaccrual loans. Charge-offs were 59 basis points this quarter and included the impact from our most recent shared national credit exam. Nonperforming loans increased $131 million primarily driven by energy credits. Total delinquencies and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4% and 9%, respectively, while business services criticized loans increased 12%. Recently, regulatory agencies issued guidance stating short-term modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of economic impacts created by COVID-19 will not be classified as a troubled debt restructured loan as long as their payments were current as of December 31. We do not expect a material increase in TDRs. In this environment, we are monitoring all of our portfolios closely. However, I want to take a couple of minutes to highlight a few portfolios currently experiencing stress. In most instances, these are the same portfolios we have been discussing for some time now. Energy is a portfolio we continue to monitor. Direct energy balances totaled $2.4 billion or 2.7% of loans outstanding at quarter end. Since 2014, we have worked diligently to remix the portfolio and reduce our exposure to the oilfield services sector, which is where most of our losses have occurred. During the quarter, we conducted an intensive review of all of our energy clients, including E&Ps, midstream and oilfield services, which resulted in a handful of downgrades in both the E&P and midstream space. We have been in the energy business for over 50 years and have always maintained a heavy focus on client selectivity. Our spring borrowing base redeterminations are in process, and we are continually reassessing our price deck. At current oil price levels, we do expect additional stress but overall believe the portfolio will perform at least as well as it did in the 2014 crisis, perhaps even better given the significant remixing in the portfolio. Within the hospitality portfolio, which includes restaurant and hotels, we are closely monitoring casual dining and quickserve. Total restaurant balances were $1.9 billion at quarter end. Casual dining restaurants with balances of approximately $550 million are continuing to experience stress due to higher labor costs, oversupply, digital transformation challenges and general pressure on margins. We expect additional pressure in this space as shelter in place orders continue. In fact, we're already receiving requests for mitigation and payment deferrals. Quickserve, which represents 63% of our restaurant portfolio, seems to be holding up well. Our exposure to hotels is primarily limited to a handful of large, well-structured REITs, which typically have lower leverage and strong cash positions. Depending on the ultimate duration of the pandemic, we expect most will weather the downturn. However, we have already experienced several requests for relief. We're also closely watching the transportation, retail and agriculture portfolios as they also have the potential to be adversely impacted by the current business environment. I previously mentioned the approximately $2 billion of small business loans we acquired as part of the Ascentium Capital acquisition on April 1. These balances will be reported with our second quarter results. But let me briefly remind everyone that under CECL, you will see a sizable adjustment currently estimated to be between $100 million and $120 million, establishing our initial allowance for these loans, which will run through provision expense. This expense will be offset by accretion of the credit discount through interest income over the life of the purchased loan portfolio. Recent annual loss rates on this book of business have been approximately 2.5%. Because they focus on business-essential equipment and high FICO guarantors, we believe the business will be resilient through periods of stress. Recall, the average yield on these loans are approximately 10%, and they do include certain prepayment protections. So while losses will increase in the near term due to the economic environment, we continue to feel very good about the acquisition and are looking forward to working together to better support our small business customers. The extent to which all of our customers are ultimately impacted will be a factor of the duration and severity of the economic impact as well as the effectiveness of the various government programs in place to support individuals and businesses. There is a lot that is still unknown. However, what we do know is that we enter this environment from a position of strength and are committed to assisting our customers and communities. As John mentioned, we know we will experience some stress. However, our strong capital and liquidity positions accompanied by decade long journey to enhance our credit risk management framework and our discipline and dynamic approach to managing concentration risks have made us better managers of risk and have positioned us well to weather an economic downturn. So let\u2019s take a look at capital and liquidity, during periods of stress, liquidity management is critical. Like the rest of the industry, we experienced a spike in credit line draws late in the quarter. These were primarily from companies being prudent and wanting to ensure they had adequate cash on hand. We did the same thing through additional advances at the Federal Home Loan Bank, which we used to increase our cash at the Federal Reserve. Liquidity at Regions really starts with our granular and stable deposit base, which provides superior liquidity value. Regions has traditionally maintain one of the lowest loan deposit ratios in our peer group in a quarter end this ratio stood at 88% and includes the impact of increased line of credit draws observed by customers late in the quarter. Further, our risk management and stress testing framework ensure our liquidity positions are prepared to meet customer needs and turbulent times such as lease. Beyond deposits, Regions also has ample sources of additional liquidity, which can be readily used to meet customer needs. Our primary liquidity sources include cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, and unencumbered highly liquid securities, these readily available sources totaled approximately $28 billion at quarter end and when combined with another $15 billion of availability at the Federal Reserve discount window, total available liquidity stands at $43 billion. FHLB advances remain the primary tool we used to fulfill short-term funding needs. We have seen great interest in the SBA and Paycheck protection program loans and we are endeavoring to meet the needs of customers. While we were use liquidity resources on hand to meet those near-term needs, we\u2019re also looking at the Federal Reserve\u2019s new Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility as an alternative funding source. With respect the parent company cash, we also maintain a conservative position. By policy parent company cash must always exceed 18 months worth of debt service and dividend payments and current cash forecast remain above our management target of 24 months. Let\u2019s turn to capital, Regions continues to maintain strong capital levels. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio is estimated at 9.4%. Our quantitative target for this ratio is derived mathematically and as we have previously discussed is 9%. We believe this is the appropriate level of capital to withstand a severely adverse scenario and still remain above post stress limits. We\u2019ve also maintained approximately 50 basis points as a strategic management buffer, which could be deployed opportunistically. We use the portion of the management buffer on the Ascentium transaction, which closed April 1. As we go forward, future economic performance and its impact on earnings will be the primary driver of near-term capital levels. In addition to the negative implications due to COVID-19, it is also important to keep in mind that we have never seen the volume at which fiscal stimulus and government lending programs have been implemented. The ability of these programs to effectively work to help support the businesses and consumers within the economy will dramatically impact credit performance for us and the industry. During this period of uncertainty, we will continue to work with our customers to help them navigate these uncertain times. Additionally, we will lean into our early warning and key performance indicators that we have built over the years, which give us a granular view into the performance of our portfolios, where we see indications that a customer will continue to face stress once a short-term relief is over, we will move those credits into more adversely rated categories and we\u2019ll continue to review their performance. As you know, we have a robust capital planning infrastructure and perform a range of stress is on credit performance within our portfolio, whereas this environment is unlike anything we have ever seen our stress testing gives us confidence that we have the capital to withstand the stress. During the quarter, the company declared $149 million in common dividends. We had no share repurchases during the quarter and have announced plans to suspend share repurchases through the second quarter. Because we established our dividend to withstand adverse conditions, we currently have no plans to reduce or eliminate our dividend. However, we will continue to exercise prudent capital management and monitor the business environment. So in summary, our robust capital and liquidity planning processes, which are stressed internally as well as externally by our regulators are designed to ensure resilience and sustainability. This gives us confidence that we can continue to meet the needs of our customers and communities during this exceptional period of economic uncertainty. As John mentioned, considering the unprecedented environment we are facing, we are resending our financial targets for this year, as well as our three year targets previously announced in 2019. We have a good strategic plan and are committed to its continued execution. When the economic outlook becomes more certain, we will provide you with updated targets. In the meantime, we are focusing our attention on helping our associates, customers and communities navigate through this difficult landscape, which in turn benefits you our shareholders. We believe strongly in the concept of shared value, in order for us to thrive, the communities we serve also need to thrive. Rest assured during this extraordinary time, Regions stands ready to help and support all of our stakeholders. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. In light of the current environment, we do ask that each of you ask only one question to allow for more participants. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. John Turner : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. I have couple \u2013 so my one question is just regarding the decision to pull the medium-term guidance, I totally understand the 2020, but when I see that you\u2019re pulling the medium term guidance, I\u2019m wondering is that because of the concern you have around the depth of how tough 2020 could end up being or is there some other rationale for that? David Turner : Yes, this is David. I just thank you. And the uncertainty that\u2019s in the environment right now is just prudent for us to just remove it all. There\u2019ll be an appropriate time for us to put back and give you our target \u2013 long-term targets. I mean, you\u2019ve known after a couple of Investor Day, where we strive to get but I just didn\u2019t seem appropriate for us to have those at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. John Turner : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : All right, thanks. Good morning guys. So I just \u2013 a question on just all the moving parts around your NII forecast. I understanding that there\u2019s the lower PPP, there\u2019s the Ascentium. I guess, with the persistence of your hedges, do you still believe you\u2019ve got that general sustainability past 2Q in terms of the ability to support dollars of NII as you look past these \u2013 the ads as you get in from first to second. How would you help us understand that? John Turner : Yes. So going into the second quarter, we said we\u2019d pick up NII resulting from our Ascentium acquisition. Clearly, the hedges you could see our \u2013 we have chart in there as to when our hedges continue to more of them kick in latter part of this quarter and into the second quarter. We only had $10 million of benefit in the first quarter from our hedges. You can see we also have $1.7 billion of fair value, which comes in over approximately five years. So if you just did some straight lining, you would see an approximate $75 million benefit in each of the quarters. And it\u2019s not straight line, but that just gives you a ballpark. So with that, we strongly believe in the support we\u2019re going to get from our hedges. We think that\u2019s a big differentiator for us. Clearly the margin will shift down a bit and then kind of stabilize there for the remainder of the year. After the Ascentium impact and you get the hedges rolling in, the growth in NII really will be driven by the balance sheet and what happens from that standpoint. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thanks a lot, David. I\u2019ll leave it there given your one question request. David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous Research. Brian Foran : Hi. Maybe a follow-up on hedges. It\u2019s interesting, I mean, all the regional banks generally opted out of including a OCI and capital as a \u2013 we\u2019ve seen as a form of regulatory relief. But now, especially for a bank like you where you\u2019ve got the outside team that it kind of understates your capital ratios in a way. So I wonder, can you just remind us, what would the capital ratios look like if the unrealized gains were included and is there any scenario where the hedges are so valuable you would actually monetize that \u2013 invest them some way in an acquisition or a buyback or is that just too far out? David Turner : Well, so we made our decision to exclude OCI, it was a choice we had. Had we not made that choice, we would have had just with the hedges that we have another $1.7 billion that\u2019s pretax in our capital. But once you make the decision, you have to live by it. And that\u2019s okay. So, to the extent that we see opportunities to terminate those swaps, we would take that gain. It would be deferred and amortized and the income therefore capital over the remaining life of the swaps, which as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier our five-year tenor. So that would only be in a case where you saw the probability of rates increasing. And then we\u2019d get ahead of that. That does not seem to be the case at this point in time. But you\u2019re asking the right question. There will come a point in time where we do that. Remember the hedges are to protect net income from being degraded as a result of the low interest rate environment. It\u2019s not an incremental. It is trying to protect what we do have. And so while we\u2019re enjoying that protection, there\u2019s no need for us to try and front end gains and use that for capital actions to sustain our profile in our consistency of generating PPNR. Brian Foran : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. John Turner : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you just talk about some of the expense levers that you can pull, while a lot of things are shutdown and there\u2019s obviously a lot of emphasis on employees. But you\u2019ve had kind of continuous improvement on expenses for several years and just talk about some of the things that you can look at in the environment here. Thanks. David Turner : Yes, Matt. So, we\u2019ve continued to be focused on expense management. I think we\u2019ve done a really good job there. If you look at our top categories, salaries and benefits, occupancy and charter fixtures and equipment, the places we\u2019ve been able to reduce expenses have been attached to our branches. We\u2019ve consolidated a whole lot more branches than we\u2019ve opened up. We continued to look at that and continue to have \u2013 we have a whole group of people focused on our retail network strategy to make sure that we\u2019re optimizing that network from a revenue and growth generation as well as cost optimization. So you should expect us to continue there. We have continued to reduce square footage that we\u2019re down some 300,000 square feet in the quarter. We\u2019ll be down another 600,000 to 700,000 for the full year. And we\u2019re learning some things working from home and we\u2019ve really had missed a beat in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. So I had mentioned in the prepared comments kind of hoteling and maybe there\u2019s an opportunity for us to continue to ramp that up even more so. Our vendor spin, we continued to have programs in place to control and reduce the vendor costs in particular, on the demand management side of things. So I think, we have 73 initiatives that we've identified in continuous improvement. I had mentioned, we're through 40% of those \u2013 actually we\u2019re through about 32 of them. We'll complete another 14 this year. So John has asked us to figure out how we get better at whatever we do, wherever you are in the bank, how do you do it better tomorrow than you did today? And so I think you should continue to see us look for ways to become more efficient and effective over time. So we're \u2013 we have some ways to continue to work on the expense side. John Turner : And I would just add, Matt, we've seen a lot of change and improvement over the last four or five weeks as we've accelerated the need to react the way we serve our customers. And so I think it bodes well for continued process improvement. With process improvement, we\u2019re getting greater efficiency. We're absolutely committed to effectively managing expenses all the time, but particularly during this period of some great uncertainty. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. John Turner : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned energy and restaurant lending being particularly stressed. What kind of loss content do you think you could see in these two buckets, considering a range of possibilities of economic recovery? John Turner : Barb, if you want to take that question? Barb Godin : Sure. Good morning, Jennifer. As we look at the energy buckets as an example, we know that\u2019s right now that there is acute demand dislocation. However, on the other hand, you also have OPEC which came out and reduced the supply by 9.7 million barrels. And then you combine that with the opening of the economy, which we're hoping will help, should happen soon, and that's going to help with demand and with some stabilization and prices. I'd also point to with the books that we now have, the fact that majority of it is now midstream and primary E&P in the senior secured position, no second lien positions, et cetera, that you're feeling pretty good about that book. We actually stressed at, Jennifer, down to $24 a barrel. We also know we're in a contango market, so we do anticipate higher future prices as well. But we also know that crude storage is an issue. So we've got our eyes on energy. We're managing again on a day-to-day basis. Are we going to see some more energy losses? Probably, but here are two, four of our E&P book, we've only taken $5 million of losses since 2012 for E&P. The one that we have this quarter, we saw the loss numbers. It was roughly a $21 million loss to an E&P customer to that grouping, but it was a Master Limited Partnership, so not truly E&P per se, and I would say, a Shared National Credit as well. So we do see some of our non-performing loans are going to increase and criticized and classified, they\u2019re going to increase, but in terms of surge-off, well we know they all increase. We think, they will be well under control. Let me talk to you a second on restaurants. Restaurants instead \u2013 but primarily for restaurant, it's going to be some of the quick serve and fast casual, et cetera. What we know is our quick service down 20% to 30%, fast casual just down 30% to 40% right now. It's 3% of our restaurant outstandings are all secured. And we know that the full service restaurants right now are experiencing the greatest impact. So again, saying that we know that there's going to be some more losses coming out of restaurants and again, we feel that they're going to be pretty well controlled given one we are. John Turner : Thank you, Barb. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush. John Turner : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : Good morning. Can you just talk about some of your economic assumptions, what you're assuming and I'm just curious, if you cut it off on March 31, because we've just seen the recent economic work have gotten a little bit worse? David Turner : Yes. So Peter, given the significant economic volatility associated with COVID-19, we actually ran several economic scenarios to determine our allowance for credit losses. We also use third-party comparisons in particular, Moody's March 27 comparison. Our models really weren\u2019t built for this type of change, so we knew we were going to have to have some overlays on top of that to get it to what we thought was an appropriate, allowance for credit losses. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion in terms of what we think about the recovery, and what shape it is? And really we think a better question would be not the shape of the curve, but at what pace does it actually recover to pre-recession levels and we\u2019ll call it pre-recession be in the fourth quarter of 2019. So, we have pretty severe numbers of GDP, approaching that 20% in the second quarter, unemployment, approaching the 10%. And while it does, we do expect it recover. We expect that it\u2019s going to be very slow. If you go back to the financial crisis, it took about 14 quarters before we got back to pre-recession GDP. Our expectation is it\u2019s going to be somewhere between 10 and 12 quarters before we get back there. So, call it the later part of 2022. So, we do not think the snaps back. We think it\u2019s prolonged. We get better from the second quarter. Right? So, you start to come up. But you\u2019re just not going to come up at the pace that you just went down. Therefore it can\u2019t vis-\u00e0-vis. It\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t know what the symbol is, but call the checkmark more so. And the slope of that will be the recovery again, getting back to GDP in the fourth quarter of 2022. Peter Winter : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. John Turner : Good Morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. My question is for Barb, if I could. So the last time, Regions went through DFAS, the nine quarter loss rate was 3.9% under severely adverse versus the Fed-run test at 6.5%. And I can see the historical bias in the CRE bucket, but I\u2019m wondering, Barb, if you could, give us a sense of what the difference is particularly in where they think your C&I loss rate would be in such a scenario versus yours? That\u2019s a pretty wide gap there. And in the most impacted industries that you outlined for us is a cumulative loss rate over two years of around 6% to 7% like we saw in the GFC fair? Or do you think there\u2019s just, strong enough underwriting that would preclude that scenario from unfolding? Barb Godin : Well, we always know, firstly, Jennifer [ph] that we\u2019re always going to have increase losses during these times of stress. So, I\u2019ll start with that. And we also know, and I feel really comfortable on this as saying that as fact that our underwriting has changed, our risk management is really strong. The entire company is focused on overall risk management. So, we are going to perform better than in prior periods. If we look at what our DFAS losses were I\u2019ll just use 2018 maybe as a bellwether, and somebody had used that in one of their analysis. And at the time they said the \u2013 that\u2019s currently, I\u2019ll see, I\u2019m sorry, my allowance is $1.665 billion and the 2018 DFAS losses at the time was $3.1 billion. So that\u2019s roughly 55% in a severe adverse environment of that. And I think that\u2019s pretty good. I think it\u2019s going to range somewhere between the high-40s and, somewhere into the 50s. So, again generally is feeling comfortable with those numbers. Did I answer your question? Erika Najarian : Yes, I guess, we just wanted to clarify what you think the primary differences are in terms of what the fed sees in your portfolio in terms of the worst loss experience and also trying to figure out the upper bound of cumulative losses in those most impacted sectors that you\u2019ve outlined in your presentation? Barb Godin : I think the biggest difference between what we look at and what the fed looks at. So, even though we take history into account, the fed models are much more heavily biased towards history, which is the reason I started with we are a changed company. We\u2019re not going back to 2009, 2010, 2011 outlook areas with curious. But those were our highest loss histories, which are currently still in the models and the fed model, as you know, they don\u2019t disclose how they arrive at your model. So, we have to make some assumptions and we know that there\u2019s still a fairly heavy weighting on that, whereas we have probably less of a waiting on that, especially given all of our performance since then has been much better. John Turner : Erika, just to add, this is John. We've spent a lot of time. I think as you know focused on client selectivity on risk adjusted returns, on balance and diversity, on de-risking. If you look across our portfolios, we don't have meaningful concentrations. In my view anyway, in any particular asset classes, we have a rigorous capital planning and stress testing process. We're applying stress as against our portfolio and making observations about it based upon what we know today. The provision and the reserves that were currently provisioned, we experience the reserves we're currently holding reflect our expectation of losses, given what we know, if this economic environment that exists currently persist, then it is very possible that we could see some additional provisioning. But we do believe our loss experience will be much better as to why our own projections are different from the fed and we're always trying to figure that out and we still have, I think work to do to better understand. We've been advocating and the fed is responding to giving us more transparency into their assumptions in their work, because we think that'll be helpful. If there's a real difference between what they believe and what we believe. We need to understand what that is, so that we can react to and so just purely from a standpoint of regulatory relationships, it is something that we continue to advocate for. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. David Turner : Good morning, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. I just have a very specific question on Ascentium, so you're taking your CECL true up on that loan \u2013 I'm sorry, on the loan book, what was the credit mark on that and by extension, how much of an incremental purchase accounting accretion benefit are you going to get on that? John Turner : Yes. So on day one, we are still working through that. We've given you a range of this adjustment in a $100 million to $120 million range that will be utilized or set up as to be amortized to margin over the life of the loan. And we'll \u2013 that's our best estimate for that adjustment at this time. And just kind of frame it up as to where that number comes from, so losses in that portfolio have been about 2.5% and the duration of that book is under three years, call it 2.5 years. And so we will have something in two times that \u2013 to 2.5 times that number, that will be recorded in the allowance for the offset and then becoming part of the purchase accounting accretion over time. Saul Martinez : Okay. So, I'm sorry, just getting into the view of the accounting, but my understanding is there's essentially a double hit. John Turner : That's right. Saul Martinez : So you'll have a similar size credit mark and then over the two years, 2.5 years you would amortize, you would have that, come back to as purchase accounting accretion and theoretically that should out flow to the bottom line given the process flow. John Turner : That's correct. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. Thank you so much. David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Turner : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Question on the credit side, based upon that we got new Moody's data that had come out after the quarter close. Does that point to a likelihood of an additional reserve build in the second quarter? And then separately, could you give us a little bit of detail of what type of loan loss reserve you have against some of those higher risk portfolios that you mentioned on those slides in the back of the deck? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So from a second quarter standpoint, we did the best we could, coming up with what we believe to be an appropriate CECL provision for the life of the loan at March 31, taking in all available evidence. Clearly, as John just mentioned, if things persist at this level and the stimulus doesn't work or doesn't work to the degree we think. There is a risk that we provide overcharge offs in subsequent quarters. The question is we just need to wait and see what it looks like at the end of June. We can't \u2013 every day is a new day. This is a very volatile environment. So things continued to trend worse at this point in time, but we also have $5.1 trillion of stimulus going into the system, which compares to about $2.1 trillion in the last crisis. And that would remind everybody that $2.1 trillion came over time, this $5.1 trillion is coming pretty quickly. And I know the government is continuing to look at additional ways to provide stimulus. So what does it all mean? It's just hard to estimate. So we can't conclude right now that we would have an adjustment overcharge offs, but that's reasonably possible given if things trend like this. That's a likely event. What was the second part of your\u2026 John Pancari : Question was \u2013 it was just \u2013 yes, just the size of the reserve that you have against some of the higher risk portfolios that you've flagged, including leverage lending? David Turner : Yes. I don't have that granularity in front of me on those particular portfolios, yet we're going have some incremental disclosure in our 10-Q of the major components. So business services, consumer, then within that, that the breakout or mortgage, credit card, indirect auto and so forth. But I don't have that John on at \u2013 that level. We can get that to you. John Turner : Yes. We are \u2013 just to break down business versus consumer. We're holding 150 basis points of reserves against the business portfolio. 260 basis points against consumer to get you back to the 190. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Dave Rochester of Compass Point. Dave Rochester : Hey, good morning guys. Appreciate all the color on the energy and the restaurant books. Just maybe dig in a little bit deeper, was just wondering how far along you are in that borrowing base redetermination process at this point? And if you have a sense for where the new deck is, how much lines have contracted for those customers and then just on the restaurant book, if you've been able to do a full review of that book as well. And if you have a sense for how many customers may no longer be operating at this point and just how you project should be for that if you assume some of those guys come back into business. Thanks. John Turner : Yes, Barb, do you want to respond to that question? Barb Godin : Yes. For the energy books, we are roughly a quarter of the way through the borrowing base redetermination for the season. So far we've seen that those borrowing bases, availability is down about 12.5%. So we know that there's clearly some impacts there. We should be through the rest of our book in the course of the next month, month and a half, so we can always give more color at that point in time. On the restaurant book, we've also looked at each client individually because there aren't that many clients. And so we were talking to them on a regular basis, daily, weekly, monthly right now, make sure we have our handle on that. We do see some continued pressure on full service in particular as I said quickservice is a lot better. But the full-service portfolio, which has got, as I said, the most impact is really because of the restaurants are closed. So until the economy opens up, we're going to continue to see some pressure there and we're going to continue to see some losses there, albeit, we believe they are at very manageable and containable. Dave Rochester : So what portion of that book would be closed right now? And then do you just assume they come back later on in your reserving process? Barb Godin : Yes. I don't have the exact numbers that are closed at this minute, but in the restaurant book, we have 3,600 customers in total. And of that it would be somewhere, a portion of that obviously. And in terms of close, it's hard to count. Do I count each individual shop in terms of someone who's got multiple units and they've only closed one or two, et cetera. So that becomes a little bit of a tricky answer to that question. But yes, there are handful probably in the nature of 10 to 20 right now. John Turner : Yes. The only thing I would add, just sort of point you to our slide number \u2013 on page 23 I think. Barb says the \u2013 a bulk of the casual dining portfolio represented by about 34 customers is just over a $0.5 million \u2013 $0.5 billion in exposure. 21% of that portfolio is currently criticized and that reflects our view of the risk in that portfolio today based upon what we know. Dave Rochester : All right. Great. Thanks guys. John Turner : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Scouten of Piper Sandler. John Turner : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Scouten : Hey guys. Good morning. I remind you dig in a little deeper maybe into some of the impacts from some of the government programs, I know it's kind of hard to say, but \u2013 and regulatory relief. And maybe specifically on the payment deferrals, if you have a percentage amount of your loans that are in deferrals currently, and how you think those pan out maybe 90 or 180 days down the line, if those do become TDRs down the line? And then with the main street lending program in particular, how might that impact your syndicated loan book and those people's ability to kind of borrow additional funds, if it\u2019s not refinanced yet? John Turner : So maybe I'll work backwards. I think there's a lot of interest in the main street lending program. We have a team working on better understanding the guidelines and how it will apply. I don't know that we have a real good feel yet for how many customers will ultimately be interested and how that might affect our customer base, but clearly one of a number of programs that the government and/or Congress have made available to customers that will be helpful over time. I can\u2019t remember the first part of your question now. David Turner : Payment deferrals. John Turner : Payment deferrals. So with our business customers and we've now granted about 4,000 deferrals, 3000 small businesses, about a 1,000 middle market customers. So our approach there is to treat those customers on a case-by-case basis to evaluate the ongoing FC of their business. And if prior to the pandemic starting, they had a viable business and we\u2019re \u2013 and doing well, or a good customer, then we'll typically grant them a deferral and in some instances that might be for up to six months, generally their 90-day deferrals interest only typically and then we revisit those at the end of that period. But that is specific to customers who were in good standing prior to the pandemic beginning and they clearly appear to have what we believe to be a viable business after the pandemic, whenever that is. On the consumer side, we're generally offering deferrals for 90 days to customers. At the end of that 90-day period we revisit where we are and consider another 90-day deferral. The bank, as I mentioned, we've granted 4,000 deferrals in our balance sheet \u2013 own balance sheet mortgage book, another 12,000 deferrals for the portfolio \u2013 mortgage portfolio that we service for others and about 13,000 deferrals of other consumer credit, whether it\u2019d be credit cards, installment loans, home equity lines, et cetera, which is roughly a little less on the mortgage portfolio, a little less than $900 million which \u2013 and that's a $14.5 billion portfolio. So that\u2019d give you some perspective. Barb Godin : Yes. And this is Barb, just to give you some percentages based on what John said. On the mortgage portfolio for our own book, it's about 7.5% of our accounts have been deferred on the commercial corporate book at 6% and the consumer book is 2.2% just given a large number of consumers. John Turner : And I think on our mortgage book Barb, half of the loans that have been deferred, the loan-to-value is less than 50%. Barb Godin : That is correct. John Turner : Yes. Stephen Scouten : Great. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it. John Turner : Hope that's helpful. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura. John Turner : Good morning. Bill Carcache : Hi, good morning. My main question is on how much you think the payment protection program will really benefit credit performance on the consumer side of your business? I'm curious because, employees who are participating in PPP are getting those benefits in lieu of what would otherwise be unemployment insurance, which suggests I think that PPP may be understating the level of initial claims. Was curious to hear your thoughts on that. And since we know historically higher level of initial claims are associated with elevated consumer credit losses. And I just wonder whether you had any perspective on whether the payment behavior of employees participating in PPP would help you guys minimize credit losses on the consumer side of your business? John Turner : Yes, it's completely anecdotal. As I talk to customers, some have furloughed employees that they intend to bring back if they get funding under the PPP program and so those employees likely went and applied for unemployment and \u2013 but may get an opportunity to come back at some point. And, and so you have that subset versus the group that have been maintaining their workforce in an ongoing basis and are hopeful to get PPP funding in order to continue to employ those teams. The funding is typically for about an eight-week period and so I think and as we look at the program, we think it is very helpful in the short run. There is a tremendous amount of interest in a program, way more interest in need for funding than has been appropriated today. We're very hopeful that Congress will appropriate some more money to help small business. I would say that in the short run, I do think that it will have a positive impact both on consumers, small businesses, and as a result corresponding credit that we have, but I don't think it's a solution three or four months from now if they're not \u2013 it's not other funding that comes behind it in some way, shape or form. Bill Carcache : That's super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery. John Turner : Good morning. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Hey, I'll just wanted to ask about the CECL forecast period, if Barb can walk us through that. Does that work against you with the new numbers on unemployment or was that already factored at the end of March? Barb Godin : Yes. For CECL, we already \u2013 we did the nine-quarter losses; we have a two-year reversion period. So we looked at nine quarters as compared to CCAR, which is nine quarters, so it's not a lot different. And really what we did, and I can quickly talk about that as we looked at several different internally developed economic forecast that we did as well as industry stress level analysis that are included, the Moody's critical pandemics that came out recently. And then both of those looking at those gave us a range of potential losses due to what's going to happen in COVID. And then we took those outlook, which included again both acute economic stress in the immediate term as well as in a general recession type outlook. And our analysis reflected the key economic variables to our models for our base forecast as well as an abrupt recession and typical recession, et cetera. So again, a lot of different input to help inform us for a potential range of future charge-offs. And then we performed specific stresses on sectors we believe would be most impacted. So as an example, I mean these are included but not limited to energy, restaurant, hotels, manufacturing, retail trade. And again, came up with what we felt was our best numbers; this was the 250 overcharge-off. By the way, this is the same process I just walked you through that we rely on when we're doing our CCAR and doing our capital planning, which is why we feel good about the process given we've been doing capital planning now for years and years, have a very strong, very solid process there and this incorporates what we're seeing here coming out of CECL \u2013 coming out of what's happening with the COVID environment. Christopher Marinac : Great. Thank you, Barbara and Thank you, John. John Turner : Thank you. Okay, that's the last question we have. Well, thank you all for your interest. These are very unusual times. We're awfully proud of the work that our team is doing to take care of our customers and to focus on their own health and safety. Hope you all will do as well and appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide some high level commentary and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. Earnings-related documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the Q&A segment of today's call. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and thank you all for joining our call today. Over the last four months, we've experienced tremendous disruption and uncertainty caused by both COVID-19 and overt examples of social inequality. The impact on our customers, communities, and associates has been profound, and the resulting operating environment has been challenging. As our country works through the current health crisis and take steps to address the systemic racial injustices that impact so many people in our society, we remain focused on the things that we can control. We're committed to supporting our associates, our communities, and our customers through these difficult times by providing much needed capital, advice and guidance, and financial support. It is incumbent on us to use our resources and expertise in ways that create positive change. Providing value to all stakeholders creates the foundation to deliver sustainable long-term performance. The disruptive and uncertain operating environment has presented both opportunities and challenges. In the second quarter, we delivered $646 million in adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income. This was Region's highest PPI in over 10 years, and a reflection of our decade long effort to optimize our balance sheet and improve risk adjusted returns while making strategic investments, all to deliver sustainable performance and reduce variability in our revenue streams. However, while the core business performance was solid, it was more than offset by an elevated provisions caused by further deterioration in the economic outlook and the resulting impact on risk ratings and credit quality. Just a few weeks ago, while acknowledging that conditions were fragile, I said we were cautiously optimistic about the prospect for economic recovery in our footprint. The southeast had fared better than other parts of the economy as evidenced by the fact that the unemployment rate in the majority of southeastern states had been better than the national average. And the number of small businesses it closed within the region, because of the crisis, was also below the national average. Most of the states where we operate had reopened, consumer deferral requests have begun to taper off and consumer spend continued to increase toward more normal levels. So clearly, there were some positive signs that we felt pretty good about. However, by the end of the quarter, certain areas in our footprint began experiencing an acceleration in COVID-19 cases and some states paused or reversed their reopening plans. The potential for a second wave of COVID-19 infections, coupled with uncertainty surrounding the extension, or renewal of various aid programs included in the CARES Act has impacted our view on the potential pace of the recovery. While we have experienced positive momentum over the latter part of the quarter, much uncertainty remains and our provisioning reflects that. As a result of this environment, we recorded a second quarter credit loss provision of $882 million. The provision reflects adverse conditions and significant uncertainty within the economic outlook, combined with downgrades in certain portfolios, particularly energy, restaurant, retail and hotel, as well as the impact of $182 million in net charge offs. This quarter\u2019s provision also includes $64 million related to the initial allowance for non-credit deteriorated loans acquired in the purchase of Ascentium Capital, which closed on April 1. We're committed to assisting our customers through this difficult time. However, we have not modified our rigorous credit review process and have continued to make risk rating adjustments as necessary. In addition, all business loans granted a deferral had been reviewed, and risk ratings have been adjusted in accordance with our existing policies. Based upon the work we've done and our assumptions around the economic outlook, we do not anticipate substantial reserve bills during the remainder of 2020. We know the economy will continue to experience stress as we combat the public health crisis. However, we've spent a decade strengthening our capital position and credit risk management framework, which have positioned us well to weather the economic downturn. In the most recent round of supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, regions exceeded all minimum capital levels. While we were pleased with our capital resiliency under stress, we believe our industry leading hedging program, which became effective in 2020 will provide additional support to pre-provision net revenue. With respect to our common stock dividend, the Federal Reserve has introduced an income test where the common dividend cannot exceed the average of the trailing four quarters net income. Management will recommend to the Board later next week that we maintain the dividend for the third quarter of 2020. We are committed to effectively managing our capital and strengthen organic growth, generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders, and continue lending activities to support customers and communities during the economic downturn. That being said, we must continue to focus on what we can control and remain committed to prudently managing expenses in the face of a challenging revenue environment. Thank you for your time and attention this morning. With that, I'll now turn it over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with our quarterly highlights. Second quarter results reflected a net loss available to common shareholders of $237 million or $0.25 per share items. Items impacting our results this quarter included a significant credit loss provision, pandemic-related expenses, branch consolidation charges, expenses associated with the purchase of our equipment finance business, Ascentium Capital, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt.  Partially offsetting the negative adjustments was a favorable CVA associated with customer derivatives as credit spreads improved significantly during the quarter, as well as net interest income derived from newly originated Paycheck Protection Program loans. In total, the adjusted and additional selected items highlighted on the slide reduced our pre-tax results by approximately $692 million. Let's take a look at our results starting with the balance sheet. Adjusted average loans increased 11%. Loan growth was driven primarily by elevated commercial draw activity, the addition of $2 billion in loans related to our equipment finance acquisition, and $3 billion average impact from newly originated Paycheck Protection Program loans during the quarter.  Looking ahead, our focus remains on client\u2019s selectivity and full relationships with appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Commercial loan utilization levels normalized during the quarter, as liquidity concerns have eased, and corporate borrowers have accessed the capital markets. In addition, corporate borrowers were generally feeling better about the economic outlook as the economy started to reopen. Although the recent rise in COVID-19 cases may tamper that perspective. With respect to PPP loans, it remains difficult to predict the timing of loan forgiveness. Currently, we anticipate forgiveness requests to begin in the third quarter and continue into the fourth. We will have a better idea around timing once the forgiveness process begins. Adjusted average consumer loans decreased 1% reflecting declines across all categories except mortgage, which was up 3% reflective of historically low market interest rates. Turning to deposits, deposit balances increased to record levels this quarter. Average deposits increase 16%, while ending deposits increased 17% as many of our commercial customers have brought their excess deposits back to regions, while also keeping their excess cash from line draws, PPP loans and other government stimulus in their deposit accounts. On an ending basis, corporate segment deposits increased 30%, while wealth and consumer segment deposits increased 6% and 12% respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in wholesale brokered deposits within the other segment. Although commercial line utilization rates have normalized, corporate customers are using cash held outside of the bank to pay down line draws, which continues to support elevated deposit levels. We anticipate funds received through government stimulus, and PPP will be spent by the end of the year, and the remaining deposits will stay with us until interest rates begin to move higher. Similarly, consumer deposits have continued to increase primarily due to government stimulus programs, coupled with lower overall spend. The delay in the tax filing deadline until July is also a contributor. We anticipate consumer balances to the decline in the second half of the year, as consumers make tax payments, increase spending commensurate with improvement in the economy and the current round of federal unemployment benefits expire at the end of July. Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain the strong story for regions. Net interest income increased 5% linked quarter, and as expected net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.19%. Net interest income remains a source of stability for regions despite an extremely volatile market interest rate backdrop. Linked quarter, our equipment finance acquisition elevated loan and deposit balances and our significant hedging program supported net interest income. The decline in net interest margin was mostly attributable to elevated liquidity, specifically, elevated cash levels at the Federal Reserve and higher low spread loan balances associated with PPP accounted for approximately 19 basis points of margin compression. Efforts to reduce these elevated cash levels are ongoing. During the quarter $7.4 billion of early extinguishment of FHLB advances, and a $650 million bank debt tender directly reduced outstanding cash balances. The implications of liquidity on net interest margin are expected to abate over the remainder of the year. However, the impact remains uncertain given the amount of liquidity in the system. Now that most of our forward starting hedges have begun, and given our ability to move deposit costs lower, our balance sheet was largely insulated from the decline in short-term rates this quarter. Loan hedges added approximately $60 million to net interest income and 19 basis points to the margin. The benefits from hedging will continue to increase as the majority of the remaining forward starting hedges begin in the third quarter. Current estimates for the third and fourth quarters have hedging benefits approximating $95 million per quarter. Recall, our hedges have roughly five year tenors and a quarter-end pre-tax market valuation of $1.9 billion an important relative differentiator. Total deposit costs were 14 basis points for the quarter, representing a linked quarter decline of 21 basis points. Regions continues to deliver industry leading performance in this space exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise. Over the coming quarters we expect deposit costs to further decline to historical lows. Lower long-term interest rates negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin during the quarter. Premium amortization increased $7 million to $33 million attributable in-part to an unusually low first quarter. Furthermore, the re-pricing of fixed rate loans and securities at lower market rates reduced net interest income and net interest margin by $8 million and 3 basis points, respectively. Looking ahead to the third quarter, let me start by saying the uncertainty surrounding the timing of forgiveness for PPP loans may create volatility in net interest income across quarters, given the impacts from fee acceleration. We currently anticipate NII to decline between 1.5% and 2.5% linked quarter, mostly from the normalization of line activity that was elevated in the second quarter. Excluding PPP and excess cash liquidity, our core net interest margin is expected to stabilize in the mid-to-high [3.30s]. Now let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Despite the challenging operating environment, adjusted non-interest income increased 18% quarter-over-quarter. Capital markets experienced a record quarter, producing $95 million of income. Excluding favorable CVA, capital markets income totaled $61 million. Growth in capital markets was driven by record debt and equity underwriting, as well as record fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers. In light of the current environment, it is reasonable to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue, excluding CVA in the $40 million to $50 million range. Mortgage income increased 21% driven primarily by record production volumes associated with a favorable rate environment. Lower interest rates have contributed to a significant increase and year-over-year production. In fact, our full-year 2020 production is expected to exceed full-year 2019 levels by 50%. Mortgage remains a core business for regions and our strategic decision to add a significant number of mortgage bankers last year is paying off. Closed mortgage loans in the month of May represent the highest single month in our company's history and we continue to experience elevated application volumes throughout the quarter. In addition, mortgage servicing continues to be a strategic initiative. During the quarter, we initiated the new flow arrangement, allowing us to grow the servicing portfolio after experiencing several quarters of net decline. We expect mortgage to remain a strength in the consumer bank for the remainder of the year. Wealth management revenue declined 6% driven primarily by lower investment services fee income, which has been negatively impacted by reduced branch activity. Service charges revenue and card & ATM fees decreased 26% and 4% respectively, driven by lower customer spend activity. Consumer debit card spend has improved across the second quarter in fact, in the month of June, transactions were up slightly year-over-year, while spend was up over 15% year-over-year. Consumer credit card spend has improved as well, although June transaction levels were approximately 6% below the prior year, while spend was down 4%. The current environment has led to reduced overdrafts and credit card balances are lower quarter-over-quarter. Looking forward, if current spend levels persist, we estimate consumer service charges and card & ATM fees will be reduced by approximately $10 million to $15 million per month from pre-March levels. So, despite elevated unemployment, consumers appear to be holding up well. They entered the pandemic in a position of strength, and while spend levels are improving; customers continue to deliver while carefully managing their finances. Wrapping up non-interest income, market values associated with certain employee benefit assets improved during the quarter, resulting in a significant quarter-over-quarter benefit. While this increased non-interest income, it was fully offset by corresponding increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased 9%, compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 13% driven primarily by the liability impact associated with positive market value adjustments on employee benefit accounts. Elevated production based incentives, temporary [COVID pay] increases, the addition of approximately 460 associates from our equipment finance acquisition, as well as our annual merit increases, also contributed to the increase. Professional fees increased 56%, driven primarily by legal fees associated with the completion of our acquisition. FDIC assessment increased 36% attributable primarily to the effects of unfavorable economic conditions, a higher assessment base and a reduction in unsecured bank debt. In addition, expenses associated with Visa class B shares sold in a prior year increased to $9 million. The company's second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.7% and the effective tax rate was 18.3%. We continue to benefit from continuous improvement processes, as we have just completed over 50% of the current list of identified initiatives. For example, excluding our equipment finance acquisition, we have reduced total corporate space by almost 700,000 square feet, or 5% since the second quarter of last year. Through the pandemic, we have learned how to interact and communicate with customers and each other in new ways. We have seen a dramatic increase in digital adoption and continue to have success through increased calling efforts using video conferencing. Our video conferencing accounts have increased by 128% since mid-March, and year-to-date we have already surpassed a number of video conferencing sessions conducted in all of 2019. This is clear evidence our associates and customers are embracing alternatives to in-person meetings. In addition, year-over-year mobile deposits are up 36%. Deposit accounts opened digitally are up 29% and digital logins are up 24%. Further, almost half of our new digital users in 2020 have come from customers 40 years and older. In fact, digital played a significant role in our ability to assist our customers in obtaining PPP loans during the pandemic. Approximately 80% of applications were submitted online and 97% were closed using e-signature. We have been actively reducing the size of our retail network for several years now. In fact, we consolidated 36 branches this quarter. Because of increased digital adoption and changing customer preferences, we expect branch consolidations to continue. Customers have an increasing desire for an omni-channel delivery model for their banking needs. So while we consolidate branches, we will continue to add new modern locations that are best suited to provide the advice and guidance our customers expect. Similarly, we are evaluating our digital and technology spend priorities to best leverage the digital momentum we are experiencing. This shift will allow us to focus on enhancing digital banking capabilities, further advancing our digital sales capabilities in leveraging e-signature to make banking easier for our customers. We also believe there are additional opportunities where corporate space is concerned whether through increased use of [hotelling], work from home or modified scheduling; we are confident overall office square footage will continue to decline. Our expense number this quarter has a bit of noise in it, and I want to spend a few minutes walking through. If you start with our adjusted total expenses of $898 million and back out unusual items we don't adjust for, such as the expense associated with employee benefit accounts and total COVID related expenses, you get back to the core quarterly run rate, inclusive of our equipment finance acquisition in the $860 million to $870 million range. To be clear, we remain committed to making the investments needed to grow our business. However, our overall expense base must always be reflective of the revenue environment. So to an extent, the revenue environment is challenged, we will look for additional efficiency opportunities. So let's move on to asset quality. The credit loss provisions for the quarter totaled $882 million. The provision reflects adverse conditions and significant uncertainty within the economic outlook combined with downgrades in certain portfolios, as well as the impact of $182 million in net charge-offs. Portfolio level downgrades were made primarily within energy, restaurant, hotel, and retail while economic outlook uncertainty is centered primarily on the impact of unemployment and the benefits of government stimulus already enacted and the potential for additional stimulus. This quarter\u2019s provision also includes $64 million establishing the initial allowance for the non-credit deteriorated small business loans acquired as part of our equipment finance acquisition, which closed on April 1. The resulting allowance for credit losses is 2.68% of total loans and 395% of total non-accrual loans. Importantly, excluding the fully guaranteed PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses increases to 2.82% of total loans. Annualized net charge-offs were 80 basis points this quarter. The increase reflects charges taken within the energy and restaurant portfolios. Additionally, for the first time, our results now include charge-offs related to our recent equipment finance acquisition. These charge-offs contributed to $24 million decline in total non-performing loans. Total delinquencies and troubled debt restructuring loans increased 6% and 5%, respectively. Business services criticized loans increased 67%. Despite our willingness to work with our customers during this difficult time, we are not relaxing our credit policies and continue to revise risk ratings as necessary. This approach as well as specific portfolio level downgrades led to a significant increase in criticized loans. We have executed a bottom up approach to review all of our stressed business portfolios and feel this gives us good insight into potential loss and underlying stress over the second half of the year. With respect to consumers, they entered the pandemic in good shape in relation to jobs, income, loan devalues, et cetera. They have clearly benefited from the government stimulus, and recent momentum in the jobs numbers has been positive. However, resurgence of COVID-19 cases has slowed some re-openings and expectation of certain federal benefits ending in July create some downside risk. Based on the work we have completed and what we know today, we do not anticipate substantial reserve builds during the remainder of 2020. Additionally, we anticipate net charge-off levels for the remainder of the year to be consistent with the second quarter. In addition, we've continued to refine our view of at-risk portfolios resulting from the pandemic. Through our engagement with customers and actual market observations gained through the quarter, we have a more informed view of which sectors can withstand operations in this new normal. As a result, the portion of our portfolio we consider to be at the highest risk of potential loss due to the pandemic declined from $12.4 billion at the end of last quarter to $8.4 billion at June 30. This amount includes loans acquired during the quarter from our equipment finance acquisition. With respect to loan deferrals, we will have better insight in the next few weeks as the initial deferral periods expire, but we continue to see positive underlying trends. As of July 1, approximately 34% of clients have made mortgage payments, [while in forbearance] in the last 61 days. For home equity, payments while in deferral have been 36%; credit card is at 56%; and auto is at 41%; and approximately 25% of our corporate banking clients in deferral have made a payment in the last 61 days. While we have modeled second business loan deferral request at approximately 40%, early trends indicate request or tracking at less than 10% for both commitments and relationships. Let's take a look at capital and liquidity. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio is estimated at 8.9%. In late June, we received notice that the company exceeded all minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 is currently estimated at 3%. This represents the amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and is inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends. These results allow Regions to manage capital in support of lending activities and focus on appropriate shareholder returns. Our current capital plan reflects a previously announced suspension of share repurchases through the end of 2020. With respect to the common stock dividend, management will recommend to the Board that the third quarter dividend remain at its current level. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain the dividend. However, future payout capacity will be dependent on earnings over the second half of the year and any constraints imposed by the Federal Reserve. Also, it is important to note that we have approximately $1 billion of pre-tax security gains in OCI that are not included in our regulatory capital numbers unlike advanced approach banks. We exclude OCI from our capital calculations, but nonetheless, it is available to absorb potential losses. As previously noted, we have an additional $1.9 billion of pre-tax gains on our cash flow hedges in OCI, which is also excluded from regulatory capital. Terminating these hedges would not provide immediate recognition in income or capital as a gain would be deferred and amortized into income therefore supporting capital over the remaining life of the derivatives. These transactions are hedges designed to protect net income in a low rate environment. We believe there is incremental value in leaving the hedges live based on the current forward five-year LIBOR curve. However, we continue to evaluate and discuss decisioning points. This demonstrates significant additional loss absorbing capacity, which is not reflected in our regulatory capital levels. With respect to liquidity, significant deposit growth during the quarter has contributed to historically elevated liquidity sources for the company. Deposits ended the quarter at record levels and contributed to a 10 percentage point decline in our loan-to-deposit ratio to 78%. So in summary, our robust capital and liquidity planning processes, which are stressed internally, as well as externally by our regulators, are designed to ensure resilience and sustainability. This gives us confidence that we can continue to meet the needs of our customers and communities during this exceptional period of economic uncertainty. Despite the uncertain environment, we remain focused on helping our customers, associates and communities navigate through this difficult time. We have a solid strategic plan and are committed to its continued execution. Rest assured, during this extraordinary time, Regions stands ready to help and support all stakeholders. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Considering the current environment, we do ask that each of you ask only one question to allow for more questions and participants. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. John Turner : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. David Turner : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Okay, a couple questions, one, just on the outlook here for net charge-offs, you highlighted, you know, flat in 2H or so and I guess I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about the trajectory from there. Is it that at this current run rate, you feel like you're anticipating the, you know, near-term impact on the portfolio? Or is it that you don't expect an uptick in net charge-offs until things like stimulus roll-off? Barb Godin : Hey, it\u2019s Barb and I'll go ahead and respond to that, Betsy. It's a couple of things. One is we've done a deep dive in all of our portfolios. You know, virtually 95% of our business services portfolio, we've had conversations with the first line and credit together; we've talked to customer-by-customer, et cetera; we've had ongoing discussions of \u2013 some of them are happening weekly, some of them monthly, some of them bi-weekly, et cetera.  So, we really feel good about the information we have on which to look and say which customers may create an issue, but we also made a change in our thinking over the \u2013 you know since the last great recession, which is we don't want to let problems age. So if we see a problem out there and we think it might hit towards a charge-off, we are actually moving it towards charge-off, hoping we'll get a recovery in due course, but that recovery is going to be much further out. So, as we think about getting to \u2013 and that's part of what's in the second half thinking. As we get to the beginning of next year, what we anticipate is that on our business services side, the commercial part of the book, that those numbers will indeed come down and consumer is a bit of the wild card because you're right, once the deferments roll-off and the stimulus rolls off, how will they behave? But so far, I'm pretty encouraged by what I see relative to people asking for things like second deferrals, et cetera, early on, but still encouraged somewhat on that front. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that's helpful color. And I noticed, yes, the NCOs are up a little bit Q-on-Q more than what we've seen out of other institutions, so that reflects your more proactive stance, I guess, with moving people into the NPLs. Can you give us \u2026 John Turner : Yes, and Betsy, you know, just to correlate that, you see a little decline in non-performing loans quarter-over-quarter, which I think is again, a reflection of the fact that we're moving those charge-offs through the system. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Yes, exactly. Okay. A follow-up question just on the outlook for NII guide down 1.5 to 2.5 in 3Q Q-on-Q, could you just give in \u2013 give us some color around the inputs to that with regard to what you're thinking about for average earning asset growth versus the NIM? And then I know with the hedges, your core NIM is mid-to-high 330s. You know, you've got some benefit from PPP at some point through the next couple of quarters as well, so you can give us some sense of the trajectory for the main pieces into 3Q. And then, as we look for PPP, how we should anticipate that flows through from here? Thanks. David Turner : Yes, there's a lot in there. So, let me see if I can bullet down. So what we don't know is what the regime is going to be on forgiveness of PPP, so we don't have anything meaningful really coming through other than the carry that we are getting, which is, you know, pretty low carry. Probably the biggest driver is reduction in the loan book that we see. There were a lot of draws that happened in the late first quarter and in the second quarter and we saw about 80% of those be repaid by the end of the second quarter, but there's still some more that are going to be coming through. And so, I think it's reflective of that continued decline in loans.  The other is \u2013 so our deposits were up some 16%. You know, big part of that, we believe is also driven by the fact that the tax payment date was moved to July 15. And so, we should expect a run-off of deposits in the quarter, and therefore, using some assets from that standpoint. So, when you kind of add all that up, we're going to have premium amortization in terms of prepayment. So, we had talked about that being up in the $33 million range this quarter, that's probably going to be close to the upper 30s this next quarter as we see prepayments increase. And then, you know, we've talked about the reinvestment of cash flows from fixed rate loans and securities that have to go on the books at prevailing rates, that component of it cost us $8 billion this past quarter and that's harder to hedge out. So we're fully protected on the short-term moves, but we aren't \u2013 we still have some exposure to the reinvestment piece. So, you add all that up and that's where that decline in the NII is coming from. David Turner : Betsy, I should also point out that, you know, the benefit from our hedge is in the first quarter were about $10 million. What we saw this quarter was about $60 million and the benefit we'll see in the third quarter assuming rates are in the third quarter and beyond all the way for five years is about $95 million. So the hedges, we're very thankful that we have those and that's a big part of us keeping the stability of our NII and resulting core margins. Betsy Graseck : And so then, I know you don't have anything in your numbers for \u2013 you know your guidance obviously for PPP, but as those loans are forgiven, you get a temporary uptick in your NII, and so you're just going to treat that as, you know, kind of a one-off, is that how we should be thinking about it? David Turner : Well, again, it depends on what the regime is. If we end up having an unusual bump in any given quarter, we\u2019ll point that out so that investors understand that. You know if it comes in over time and it's just kind of part of our business, maybe we wouldn't, but right now, it's just so \u2013 we don't know what the regime is going to be and when we get further guidance on that we\u2019ll tell everybody and reforecast for you. Ronnie Smith : And David \u2013 this is, you know, Ronnie Smith, Betsy. Just to reiterate, there has been an extension from the initial eight-week period that businesses were able to count the funds that qualified for uses under PPP. So that 24 weeks has pushed that out a bit depending on which process the customers elect. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right, thank you. John Turner : Thank you, Betsy. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. John Turner : Hey, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Hey, good morning, everyone. You know obviously, with the big reserve this quarter, the CET1 ratio slipped a little bit below the 9% zone where you talked about being comfortable. And I just wanted to ask you to kind of flush that out vis-a-vis your other comments about, you know, continuing to recommend the dividend, the back and forth between comfort on where your ratio sit, where do you think that CET1 can get back to? And then, put that in context of the \u2013 you know, the income constraint and how you think about that, too? Thanks. David Turner : Sure. So, I assume everybody's looking at the Slide 18, where we have our waterfall and you could see the positive contribution generated from our core engine, our PPNR and then the impact of the dividend. So between those two is 50 basis points to the plus. We did have provision expense that drove that down, as well as our acquisition of Ascentium in the first quarter. So \u2013 well, I think we'd all acknowledge we're in some form of stress in the country and we've always said our mathematical calculation would lead us to desiring a common equity Tier 1 of 9% and we\u2019re holding a little excess capital to take advantage of opportunities, which one occurred, Ascentium. And so, you should expect, as you look at that waterfall chart, and again, we don't expect to have a provision at the level we just had. So, we can accrete that capital back pretty quickly, while we also have pretty robust reserves. If you look at our coverage, distress losses now, so you know, we couldn't pick the timing of when that particular transaction hit. We went to [8.9]. We're comfortable where we are, but dividend is not a capital adequacy issue. You can glean that from the DFAST analysis that came through. Now, we're going through some form of a stress test in the fourth quarter and we're not sure exactly what that regime is going to look like. What we do know is that we have, for the third quarter of the dividend limitation on the past four quarters, you know, based on our math, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we'll be recommending to our Board to sustain the dividend in third quarter. As we think about the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year, we don't know if that regime will continue and we have to suspect that it might. And therefore, we gave you guidance that we believe our dividend is sustainable going out into the fourth quarter and into the first quarter based on our expectations of forecasted earnings. That being said, the two caveats are, let's see what the economy looks like when we prepare the financial statements for September 30 and we'll make, you know, whatever adjustments are necessary. And then, whatever the Federal Reserve and supervisors may do in this fourth quarter analysis, we don't know. So, those are the two caveats, but based on what we can see, we feel good about sustaining the dividend. John Turner : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Scouten of Piper Sandler. John Turner : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Scouten : Hey, good morning. Yes, I was wondering if you guys could give a little more color around the loan deferrals. I know you said your expectation for second deferrals are maybe 40%, you're tracking under [10%]. And I'm also kind of wondering how much of those may be deferred loans that are still performing were downgraded from a rating perspective because it feels like you guys are ahead of your peers in terms of changing risk ratings, but I want to see if you can frame that up for us a little bit. John Turner : Barb, you want to speak to that? Barb Godin : Sure. Yes, so as we \u2013 when you talk about referrals in general, to begin with, I\u2019ll start with consumer, work my way to Business Services really quick, Stephen. And so, for consumer, what we saw is that deferral rate all in, in fact, for the company, it\u2019s about 6%. What I was looking at, in fact, earlier this morning is that those numbers are in fact coming down and so far in consumer, we've had no requests for second deferral yet. Mind you, it's early, and some of the first deferrals are just rolling off, but it's still a good encouraging early sign.  For the Business Services portfolio, all-in, it's about 6% as well. And again, talking to our customers, that's \u2013 you know again, the benefit of these one-by-one conversations, we've heard very limited need for a second deferral, so again, very encouraging news from that front. Relative to those that are deferred and the percent, you know, that are criticized within those, we've given a chart on Page 12 that doesn't give the criticized portion of the deferrals, but you can [intuit] from it that the criticized are large portion of those criticized percentages were \u2013 do include a deferral. John Turner : Ronnie Smith, you want to talk about the wholesale book? Ronnie Smith : Yes, John. Just from a \u2013 just the numbers, if I step back into it, Stephen, we've \u2013 we have 2,000 clients in the wholesale book that have requested deferral and out of that particular universe, we are seeing, and I think David said this in his opening comments, but we're seeing a very low request for a second deferral period. And we are using that as a leading indicator to go in and provide a scrub on a name-by-name basis to appropriately assign risk ratings to those clients who had requested a deferral. We're finding, as you can tell, in the early returns, and I want to stress its early, less than 10% of those are requesting a second deferral period. And so, that shows the strength of cash flows, liquidity that they have built up. And so, we feel good about where we are at this point, but there's a lot more deferrals that need to mature as we continue to work with each of these clients. Stephen Scouten : Okay. Very, very helpful. And if I could ask David one clarifier on the expense guidance or information you gave, you said $860 million to $870 million is kind of a better longer term run rate, maybe when do you think you can get to that level? And what level of kind of PPP-related expenses are within that number, if you have any guidance there? David Turner : Yes. So we think we can get there now. It's just \u2013 this past quarter, I acknowledge there\u2019s a lot of noise in our numbers and that's why we actually gave you a little better guidance to what to expect going forward. We had some expenses that came through PPP. They weren't particularly material in any of those that were related to loan originations or deferred as part of the fees that we get and would be amortized over the life of the loan. So, I wouldn't expect anything material from that standpoint hit us in the third quarter and going forward. Stephen Scouten : Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate the time. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. John Turner : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor : I know you guys touched on this a little bit, but coming back to credit, yes, today is an interesting day because, you know, your stock is getting hit because folks think you have worst credit because you reserve for more. Another company came out today and was taking some heat for maybe under reserving. So, you know, from an outside point of view, it's a little hard to tell, like who's being aggressive, who's maybe behind and I guess from your point of view, like, you know, why do you think you are able to kind of be more aggressive than maybe some others? Is it the loan mix? Is it just the data that you have, as you\u2019ve mentioned, has changed quite a bit in your markets, the last six weeks? John Turner : I\u2019ll answer that? Matt O\u2019Connor: Is that the pain that you went through in the last downturn? Is there anything else you could add on that? Thank you. John Turner : You know, it is, I think last quarter, we were criticized for potentially under reserving and this quarter there's questions about credit. And I think, you know, I can't speak to what other banks are doing. What I do know is what we're doing. Over the last 10 years, we worked really hard to improve our credit risk management processes. And as Ronnie and Barb described, on the wholesale side of our business, we've been through the large majority, if not all of our portfolios, high-risk portfolios, large exposures, and we have risk rated those credits, we think appropriately. And, as a result, our allowance for credit losses reflects those risk ratings. We've considered companies, industries, their ability to repay, and we're actively monitoring our portfolios, and so have presented what we believe to be an appropriate allowance given the risk that's currently in our portfolio based upon the economic assumptions we're applying and expected life of loan losses. And, you know, it's our anticipation that the portfolio will, as David has described, perform consistent with in the future, at least next two quarters. Well, charge-offs will approximate [over the] current levels and we don't anticipate any significant additional provisioning if there are no changes in the economic environment and if our, you know, credit quality doesn't further deteriorate because of changes in the economic environment. David Turner : Yes, we\u2019re trying to help everybody in our Page 19 showing the allowance waterfall and you can see the economic outlook component of $242 million that was added to the reserve and that's a reflection of \u2013 the primary driver for this is unemployment. So, when we were at the first quarter, you know, our expectation of unemployment was closer to 9%. Today, its 13%. That's a big delta. And the question is how quick is the recovery going to be? What's the impact of stimulus? So there's a lot of work that goes into ultimately determining what the allowance needs to be. We are risk grading. And Barb, you may want to chime in on this risk grading relative to what we see in the book from the ground up process that was earlier described and that's the [$382 million] that you see in the middle of that page. And remember, on top of that is the charge-off number of about $182 million. So if you add to that, it's about [$564 million of our $882 million] provision. So Barb, you want to talk about the risk rating? John Turner : I think we've covered. The point I'd make is though that there is \u2013 it's hard to distinguish between deterioration of the credit portfolio and changes in the economic environment because one effectively [begets] the other. David Turner : Yes. John Turner : I think it visually represents what is just overall, you know, our assumptions based upon the current stress environment that we're in. Matt O\u2019Connor: Alright, that was helpful. Thanks for coming through that again. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. John Turner : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : Hi, good morning. Good morning. I was just wondering when I look at the DFAST results, it seemed like they won the strongest they should have been on PPNR. And is there anything that the Fed is missing or anything you can do to address that with the Fed, especially when it comes to a stressed capital buffer? David Turner : So Peter, we \u2013 you know, as we lay down our prepared comments, we have a unique benefit of our forward starting hedges that we had put in place a couple of years ago, but they didn't become effective until the first quarter of this year for a piece of them. The second quarter had another piece, and then the third quarter, there's one more step up and you can see that in a chart that we put in the slide deck. Because that benefit wasn't in our run rate, we don't believe we got full benefit of that in our PPNR estimation in that last DFAST. As a matter of fact, our PPNR, which we believe should outperform our peer group, in that test it was in the middle of the peers, it was a median [part of] the peer group. So we're in \u2013 having discussions on how that can be reviewed by them differently. Obviously, we're going to go through some form of a stress test this fourth quarter. They'll have the knowledge [indiscernible] of our derivatives and how they come into to protect our PPNR in the stressful times, especially in the low-rate environment. So let's see what happens as they continue to evaluate both the SCB, so it\u2019s a preliminary SCB. The final won't be out until August 31. And then, on top of that, we'll have the fourth quarter stress test of some type. Peter Winter : Alright, thanks. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. John Turner : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. Just a question on deposit service charges, they were $131 million in second quarter, down from $178 million. What kind of run rate are we looking at for that line item in future quarters? And how much of the waivers are coming back in? John Turner : Yes, Jennifer, so, we tried to give a little bit of guidance. So let me roll it forward from the first quarter. If you recall, spin was down quite a bit on the consumer side and that we were concerned at that state at that level is going to cost us about $25 million a month between service charges and card and ATM fees. In our prepared comments, because of the spin coming back, in particular on debit card usage, that number is down to $10 million to $15 million per month at this current level. Now, in the month of June, we started to see that pick up a bit, but still not to the level that we had seen pre-crisis. A big driver that is the amount of stimulus that\u2019s still sitting in the deposit accounts of our customers. Therefore, you don't have NSF fees, for instance, coming through and you don't have credit card interchange coming through. So right now, we're guiding to $10 million to $15 million per month from the pre-March numbers that you really ought to think through as you model. Jennifer Demba : Thanks so much. David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. David Turner : Good morning, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. Hey, I wanted to go through the dividend math a little bit \u2013 in a little bit more detail and I know you guys said just based on your best estimates and realizing there's a lot of uncertainty here, you should be able to pay your dividend. But if the Fed does, you know, extend the dividend cap in the end of the fourth quarter, by my calculation, you guys would have to do about $260 million of net income for deferreds in the third quarter to keep your dividend at $0.16 a share. And, you know, if it's extended into next year, the math gets even more difficult as 2019 rolls off because then presumably that goes up to closer to 300. So, I guess \u2013 so what I want to get a better sense for is that when you say that you're confident in meeting your dividends, are you basically saying that you're confident that you'll be able to meet that kind of net income threshold over the next couple of quarters? David Turner : Yes, that's what we're saying. Saul Martinez : All right. That's good. I\u2019ll be respectful of the one question rule. So thank you. John Turner : Okay. Thanks, Saul. Operator : Your next question is from Dave Rochester of Compass Point. Dave Rochester : Hey, good morning, guys. John Turner : Good morning. Dave Rochester : Hey, given all the work you guys have done, but the more at-risk book and those credits under stress, which drove, you know, a lot of these downgrades and the quantitative reserve bills you guys have here, was just wondering what the reserve ratio is that you have on that at-risk book? Or what you're seeing as the, you know, overall potential loss content there? Barb Godin : Yes, and this is Barb, and right now, we would have a reserve ratio on that at-risk book of about a little over 7%. And then, if you look at some of the sub-sectors, you know, energy as an example, those high-risk segments that we point out, 10.5% to give you a sense, restaurants over 7%. So, we think we have a pretty healthy reserve on it. Dave Rochester : Great. All right, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery. John Turner : Good morning. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, good morning. Just want to follow up on some points that Bob was making earlier. So, given the changes on the business criticized, and the results of this quarter, what has to change to see that further deteriorate? Do you feel like you're ahead of that with the changes that you made this quarter? Barb Godin : Yes, I would say we're certainly on top of it. And of course, the wild card, as we all know, is what's going to happen in the economy. So, you know, our best view of the economy is what's incorporated into what our thinking is. If all of a sudden we get a second wave that comes in and closes everything down, there's going to be some more pain, but based on what we know today, and back to, you know, I'm really confident on it. As I said, we've gone through; we've had the discussions. They're not a [one and done] discussion. They are an ongoing discussion. We have these meetings set up with \u2013 I\u2019ll use Ronnie\u2019s team again and we have them all in there, we have credit in there; we spend hours going through it. So again, that gives back to giving me that level of confidence that there's nothing that's happening that we're not talking about or seeing, and more importantly, reflecting in our thoughts around what are we going to call a criticized loan or a classified loan, an MPL or charge-off for that matter. John Turner : Yes, I think the other caveat is we really \u2013 the level of federal government relief is unprecedented and it is very difficult for us to apply any sort of modeling to that. And so, depending upon whether the relief is extended or not, what that looks like, certainly is a factor as we look forward, but that, of course, would influence I think the economic conditions that we're currently assuming as well. So, it is an unusual time, but as Barb said, we feel like we're on top of our reserving and credit issues. Barb Godin : Absolutely. Christopher Marinac : Great. Thanks for the additional color. I appreciate it. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. John Turner : Vivek, good morning. Vivek Juneja : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications around credit, you mentioned \u2013 I think David mentioned, no more reserve build. David, am I to presume that you're \u2013 and at the same time you gave a guide on for net charge-offs to remain at second quarter levels? So two elements to that, where are you expecting charge offs? Where\u2019s the \u2013 you know in your line of sight that you've given this guidance, you're obviously expecting charge-offs in some categories, which are those? And then, to your reserve point, related to that, David, are you expecting provisions will at least match charge-offs? Are you presuming reserves to loans are not going to start to come down, so you're not starting to release reserves yet, right? David Turner : Well, let me start with your back part of the question, and Barb will answer the first part. So the way CECL works is we're supposed to reserve for all losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based on all the factors that are \u2013 that we can observe, economic indicators and the like. You know, and so, if we do that right and portfolio \u2013 the economy doesn't change, there's no degradation in the credit metrics, loans aren't growing, then you wouldn't expect to have provision \u2013 you can't have provision necessarily equal to charge-offs. It's kind of whatever it takes to get the reserve to the level it needs to be at the balance sheet date. So, right now, you know, we think we have it all. But as we did in the first quarter, the caveat we gave you then, we're going to give to you now. We don't know what the economy is going to look like at September 30, but based on what we do know, you know, even subsequent to closing the books, the economy hadn't degraded materially from [where we were when] we set the reserves. So, you know, we're feeling better about that going into the third quarter, which is different than going into the second. So, Barb, you want to answer the\u2026 Barb Godin : Yes, first part of the question, which is where are the charge-offs going to come from in our estimation based on the analysis that we've done, the conversations that we've had. Again, primarily from the two portfolios we've already talked about energy and restaurant. We have to see the rest of that play out. There's going to be some retail and some hotel that could impact as well, but that's generally what I would size it up to. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thank you. John Turner : Thank you, Vivek. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. John Turner : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, John. How are you? John Turner : Good, thank you. Gerard Cassidy : I've got some questions on the forbearance part of this portfolio. Once a technical question on, are you accruing all the interest for those loans, even though the customers that may not be paying versus the ones that are paying? And then a second part of the question is, have you had any conversations with the Fed on when they may go back to their more traditional stance on forbearance and more on how banks have to, you know, carry the higher capital levels against those loans? And the third part of the question is, once you go off forbearance, the Fed says, it ends let's say, second quarter of 2021 and you still got loans on forbearance, will they immediately start going into a non-performing status meaning, you know, being 30 days past due, or will you just immediately put them in a non-accrual because they're already in forbearance? David Turner : Georgia, this is David. I'll start with the first part. So loans go onto forbearance, we still accrue interest unless that loan was already on non-accrual status or it had \u2013 it didn't have the ability to pay all of its principal and its contractual principal and interest, which case, any payments that we were to receive, we actually write down the principal balance, that's our accounting policy. So for the most part, this type of forbearance that you're seeing, you can see the performance where people are still making their payments, but even if they're not, and they're not on nonaccrual we are in fact accruing interest on those. You want to talk about second part. John Turner : The second part of the question is, we have not had any conversations with the Fed about when they may change their guidance about how we work with customers in respect to the coronavirus. Their initial guidance gave examples, including six month periods of forbearance as examples of how we might consider working with customers, and we really haven't had any guidance since then. The third part of your question I think was hypothetically what do we do if we get out nine months, 12 months and a customer still can't pay, Barb you want to talk about that? Barb Godin : Yeah, I don't see a cliff at that point in time, because what we're doing is, what the process we have in place right now is, we're taking all of that information we have in place today, the customers on deferral, that's but one input point. We're looking at their cash flows. We're looking at a lot of other things to make the determination on the risk rating, which is why you're going to see customers who are paying that we may have sitting in a non-performing loan category and moved to a criticized reclassified category. So, we are making those risk rating changes, not because of the deferral, but as I said deferral is simply a point. So, I don't see a huge Cliff on any of that. John Turner : And Barb we are using the deferral as a leading indicator to go dig deeper [drawn into] that relationship, not looking at trailing 12, but what the current information is today. And what challenges that that relationship is facing. So, we're \u2013 to Barb's point, we're calling it as we see it today. David Turner : This David, I hate to pile on this, but it is important that people understand that. We are \u2013 because you are given leeway on forbearance from a regulatory standpoint. If we believe that needs to be rich graded a certain way we're doing that. So that's why you shouldn't see a cliff effect, regardless of what the Fed says about how we can treat loans or TDRs or anything. We're calling that independent \u2013 independently. Barb Godin : Exactly. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. David Turner : Thank you, Gerard. Operator : Your final question is from John Pancari of Evercore. John Turner : Good morning, John. Rahul Patil : Hi, this is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. I just have one question on the efficiency ratio, I mean it is like 2Q 2020 the efficiency ratio was around adjusted basis of 57.7%, you know you talked about your willingness to look at expenses little bit closely if the revenue environment is a challenge. Can you talk about how you are thinking about the efficiency ratio going forward, you know what sort of level is reasonable, assuming that the current conditions kind of stayed or persist through at least year-end? Because I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about a mid-50%, I\u2019m not sure if there is any update on that. David Turner : Yes, so we still have that as our long-term goal to get our efficiency ratio down into the mid-50s and then when we get there we are going to be pushing it even harder. So, we have a little bit of volatility obviously in our revenue given changing rate environment, we'll have a little bit of pressure on NII as we've mentioned just a minute ago, for the next quarter, but when you have challenges on revenue, then you have to go back and work on expenses. And that's part of our program. So, while you may see that percentage change a bit, any good quarter to quarter, I think where we are right now is sustainable over time and perhaps working that way down over time as we as we continue to work on expenses and the benefits from further hedges that actually come into force and the third quarter will help us from a revenue standpoint. John Turner : Okay. [With no] further questions, we really appreciate your participation today. Thank you for your interest in our company. Have a good weekend. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 third quarter 2020 earnings call. John and David will provide high level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, and the Q&A segment of today\u2019s call. With that, I will now turn it over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and thank you all for joining our call today. Before we get started, I want to mention that we\u2019re taking a slightly different approach to our call today. Rather than walk you through our results in detail, we\u2019ll speak the key highlights we think are most important, and then open it up for your questions. Hopefully, you\u2019ll find this approach to be a little more efficient use of your time. We\u2019re very pleased with our third quarter results. We reported earnings of $501 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.52, a 33% increase over the prior year. We continued to experience nice revenue growth while prudently managing expenses, generating the highest adjusted pretax pre-provision income in over a decade. Our core banking operations remain strong. We achieved record levels of deposits with growth across all three business segments. We continued to see growth in consumer and small business checking accounts. And despite the uncertain environment, our customers appear to be relatively healthy and are appropriately adapting their spending habits. As a result, most credit metrics improved. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with a significant decline in loan deferrals. Our customer assistance program appears to have worked as intended with the vast majority of customers who previously received deferrals now return to normal payment schedule. Our results also reflect the success of simplifying growth, our Continuous Improvement initiative. We continued to carefully manage expenses while making strategic investments to grow our business. Our third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was the lowest in 12 years, and our investments in mortgage and digital are paying off. Year-to-date mortgage production is more than double that of last year. Our focus on enhancing the digital experience is also resonating with customers. Digital logins are up 22%, mobile deposits are up 50%, and digital account openings are up 24%. And our recently redesigned iPhone app currently has a 4.7 star rating. Thus far, the Southeast seems to have fared generally better economically during the pandemic than other areas of the country. States across our footprint were among the last to shelter in place and the first to reopen. As a result, the unemployment rate has generally been around 200 basis points below the national average, contributing to a relatively stronger GDP. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pace of economic recovery in our footprint, and client sentiment continues to improve. As a result, given what we know today, we believe the credit risk in our loan portfolio is appropriately reserved and losses will be manageable. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to recognize Barb Godin. Earlier this quarter, Barb announced her plan to retire by the end of the year. So, this will be Barb\u2019s last earnings call. Barb will retire after 45 years in banking. She joined Regions in 2003 and was named Chief Credit Officer during the height of the financial crisis. Over the last 10 years, as Chief Credit Officer, Barb has done a terrific job leading our credit risk organization through a period of tremendous change. Over that time, Barb\u2019s contribution was recognized by the American Banker as one of the most powerful women in banking. She\u2019s truly done a great job for Regions, and we\u2019ll miss her presence every day. I hope you all will join me in thanking Barb for all she\u2019s done and congratulating her on a well-deserved retirement. Thank you, Barb. With that, I thank you for your time and attention, and will now turn it over to David. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let\u2019s start with the balance sheet. Average adjusted loans decreased 3%. While commercial pipelines remain healthy, business customers continue to deleverage and repay their defensive draws taken earlier in the year. While commitments have not changed appreciably, line utilization is at historic lows. Consumer growth was driven by very strong mortgage production, which has been more than double year-to-date versus the prior year. With respect to deposits, balances increased record levels again this quarter. Growth in corporate bank deposits was driven by clients consolidating their liquidity as well as increased benefit from supply chain efficiencies and declines in working asset levels. Consumer deposits also increased as we continue to grow consumer checking accounts, and customers have adjusted spending and savings behaviors. Let\u2019s shift to net interest income and margin, which remains a source of stability for Regions, despite a challenging market interest rate backdrop. Linked quarter, net interest income increased 2%, aided by our hedging program, the deployment of excess cash into securities and a number of items that may not repeat, which are described on the slide. These benefits were offset by lower loan balances. Elevated cash levels impacted net interest margin, which declined to 3.13%. Strong deposit growth drove cash levels at the total reserve higher, averaging roughly $10 billion. This, coupled with $4.5 billion of average low spread PPP loans reduced the margin by 28 basis points within the quarter and 9 basis points linked quarter. We continue to work on reducing elevated cash levels and added approximately $3 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, we reduced wholesale borrowings through a $1 billion bank debt tender and the early extinguishment of approximately $400 million of FHLB advances. Given that the majority of our hedges are now active and our ability to further reduce deposit cost, our balance sheet is largely insulated from the low short-term rate environment. In fact, additional income from lower short-term rates helped to offset some of the long-term rate degradation. Loan hedges added approximately $94 million to net interest income and 30 basis points to the margin. Recall our hedges have roughly five-year tenors and a quarter-end pretax unrealized market valuation of $1.8 billion, an important differentiator and source of regulatory capital in the coming years. Lower long-term interest rates negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin for an increase in securities premium amortization and the continued reinvestment of our portfolio of fixed rate loans and securities. Premium amortization was $46 million and included the impact of Ginnie Mae buyouts that aren\u2019t likely to repeat at the same level. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, uncertainty about the timing of PPP loan forgiveness and the related fee acceleration may create volatility in net interest income. After level setting for third quarter items that may not repeat and excluding PPP loan forgiveness, we expect net interest income to be relatively flat to modestly lower as hedging benefits and further declines in deposit costs will help to offset continued pressure from long-term rates, asset remixing and runoff. Excluding PPP and excess cash, our core net interest margin is expected to stabilize in the 3.30%s. Notably, our shift to deploy $3 billion of cash into securities will reduce the normalized margin by 6 basis points, but benefit net interest income. Now, let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 6% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved record mortgage income and had another solid quarter in capital markets. Service charges increased 16%, but remained below prior year levels. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior could keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. We estimate consumer service charges will remain approximately $30 million to $35 million per quarter behind prior year levels. Card and ATM fees have recovered compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased debit card spend. However, credit card spend continues to be slightly behind prior year levels. Let\u2019s move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses were $889 million and represented a 1% decrease quarter-over-quarter. Excluding COVID-related expenses and the impact of changes in market valuation on employee benefit accounts, adjusted expenses were $872 million. We have a proven track record of prudent expense management. Since announcing our Continuous Improvement initiative in 2016, we\u2019ve held adjusted expenses relatively flat, while continuing to invest in technology, products and people to grow our business. Continuous Improvement is ingrained in our culture. We have completed approximately 50% of the current list of initiatives and are continuing to identify new opportunities every day. We are facing an uncertain operating environment. And to the extent revenue is challenged, we will look for additional efficiency opportunities. From an asset quality perspective, overall, credit remains generally in line with our expectations from the second quarter. The credit loss provision totaled $113 million, resulting in an allowance equal to 2.74% of total loans and 316% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses increased to 2.9% of total loans. Nonperforming loans increased 19 basis points to 0.87% of total loans, primarily attributable to downgrades in retail, investor real estate and energy. Business services criticized loans and total delinquencies decreased 12% and 11%, respectively, while troubled debt restructured loans increased 3%. The improvement in criticized loans were generally in retail where we noted improvements due to strong anchor tenants. Additionally, some improvements were experienced in aspects of energy and manufacturing. Annualized net charge-offs were 50 basis points, a 30 basis-point improvement over the prior quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our footprint. However, we also recognize we remain in the highly uncertain environment. Assuming positive trends continue, we do not believe further increases to the allowance are necessary. Reductions in the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. While charge-offs can be volatile, we currently expect the fourth quarter to range from 55 to 65 basis points. This range reflects the historical pattern of elevated consumer charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Predicting the timing of net charge-offs depends on many variables, including any additional stimulus. However, based on what we know today, we would expect charge-offs to peak around mid-2021. We continue to refine our view of high-risk portfolios through ongoing conversations with customers and market observations. The portion of our portfolio considered to be at the highest risk of potential loss due to the pandemic declined from $8.4 billion at the end of last quarter to $6.6 billion at September 30th. A roll-forward of the high-risk portfolios is included in the appendix. Wrapping up with capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to an estimated 9.3%, and capital ratios are expected to continue increasing over the next several quarters. So, in summary, we feel really good about the quarter. Pretax pre-provision income remains strong. Expenses are well-controlled. Credit quality is showing resilience. Capital and liquidity are solid. And we are optimistic on the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could -- and congratulations and best of luck to Barb, I should say, on behalf of everyone. Just on the loan side, obviously, customers, as you mentioned, building liquidity, you saw the C&I continue to decline as the industry did. Can you just talk to us about when you make the point about the footprint acting better relative to other parts of the country, what you see as far as that delicate balance between customers holding liquidity and then starting to see activity and the need for borrowing increase, especially as you think about the C&I portfolio? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. Ken, this is David. So, as we think through generally our bank in terms of loan growth, we\u2019ve been kind of a GDP-plus a little bit, has been our expectation, clearly with the liquidity sitting in the hands of customers, they\u2019re going to use that first before they\u2019ll tap into committed lines of credit, if you\u2019re a business or spending or borrowing money if you\u2019re on the consumer side. What we\u2019re looking at is our production. Our production continues to be robust on the commercial side. But, our utilization is very low, and it\u2019s low for everybody. We don\u2019t know when that will bottom out. Some have called it already. We\u2019re not real sure. But, we think given the commitment there that it\u2019s just a matter of time. You start getting infrastructure spending, you get a little momentum going in the economy, we could see a loan growth picking up in 2021. We\u2019re probably not going to see that in our fourth quarter, which is why we\u2019ve given you the guide on NII that we have. John Turner : Yes. I would just add, Ken. I think, we get past the election, I think we get a little more sense about the direction of the economy. There are a number of our customers who are -- have adapted their operations to the COVID environment are doing fine and are thinking about potentially expanding their business or they are seeing a need to increase inventories because they\u2019re generally low -- all-time low levels, and yet, they\u2019re not in a hurry to do that until there\u2019s a little more uncertainty about what happens post election. So, I think it will be, as David said, early in 2021 before we have a better feel for whether we see loan growth exceeding GDP. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. And a follow-up question on the swaps portfolio. Just looking back at a slide you showed last quarter, there\u2019s still like $1.25 billion to still come on line, correct, that aren\u2019t live yet. So, versus the $94 million that you saw in NII this quarter, how much more increment add do you still expect to come from the additional swaps that haven\u2019t gone live yet? Thank you. David Turner : Yes, Ken. So, you\u2019re right. The last tranche will come due in the fourth quarter. Getting the full run rate from what we did last quarter and benefiting the next look coming into the fourth quarter. We think that 94% goes to 97ish, 95%, 97%. So, we\u2019ll get 2, 3 more million dollars per quarter. And of course, all these are five-year tenors from the date they become active. So, a couple of million dollars, I guess, is the answer. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Rose of Raymond James. John Turner : Good morning, Michael. Michael Rose : Hey. Good morning. Can you hear me? John Turner : Yes, we can. Michael Rose : Hey. How are you? Yes. So, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. I got on a little bit late. But, can you walk through some of the deposit repricing opportunities you may have in coming quarters? And how should we think about the loan-to-deposit ratio as you move into a more normalized backdrop, hopefully later next year? Is there a certain level that you guys would want to run at? I know excess liquidity tends to stick around in the zero interest rate environments, but just looking for ways that you can potentially deploy some of that excess liquidity. John Turner : Sure. So, our deposit growth continues to be very-strong. That\u2019s coming through the growth in consumer checking accounts, operating accounts for businesses. It\u2019s businesses bringing cash back to Regions. And so, I would say our deposit growth has been a little quicker, a little faster than we had anticipated. And that could persist into the fourth quarter. I think, you\u2019re right to point out that our deposit cost, while 11 basis points, we believe there is still running room to take that down a couple, 2, 3, 4 basis points over time. If you look at our interest-bearing deposit costs of 19 basis points, I think, we have running room there, more so than we probably have in the past. We\u2019ve -- if you look at the peers that have released thus far, everybody is bringing that down quite a bit. We probably could pick that up a bit. We\u2019re going to challenge ourselves as we go into the fourth quarter and into 2021. There was another part of the question? David Turner : Loan-to-deposit ratio. John Turner : Loan-to-deposit ratio. Mike, we really don\u2019t fall for that. That\u2019s kind of an outcome. We\u2019ve historically run a lower loan deposit ratio than our peers because of our deposit franchise, which is really our competitive advantage. If we could be perfect deploying it, I think being in the low 90% range would be great, but we\u2019ve kind of been in that middle 80% for a long time. Of course, everybody is lower today. And so, we have the liquidity to make all the loans to creditworthy borrowers today. We\u2019re excited about that. It\u2019s just good loan growth is hard to come by at this point. But, we\u2019re like a cold spring ready when we believe that infrastructure spending happens. Michael Rose : That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe just one follow-up. The deposit service charges came back a little bit further than I would have thought this quarter. I think some of that obviously has to do with some of the deposit growth. But, can you just give us an update on how the normalization of service charges and maybe credit card usage has ramped up here and how you expect it to play out into next year? David Turner : Yes. So, our service charges did come back a bit. We\u2019re seeing strength still in the consumer. We\u2019re seeing spending pick up a bit. Our debit card spend is ahead of where we were last year, not so much on credit card spend, it\u2019s still 2, 3 percentage points behind where we\u2019ve been in the past. Right now, our run rate, and we put in our comments, probably $10 million to $12 million a month behind pre-pandemic levels, which is $30 million, $35 million per quarter. We don\u2019t forecast that improving appreciably at this juncture. We\u2019ll have to see. We got a new potential wave of stimulus, which will continue to put that pressure and maintain that pressure at that run rate level. So, I would not count on that at this point, coming back to the pre-pandemic level. John Turner : We\u2019re seeing a change in customer behavior, which I think ultimately is a good thing. So, we\u2019re depending upon growth in consumer checking accounts as a real catalyst for driving additional fee income. And the good news is that consumer checking accounts are growing. And as a result of that, we\u2019re seeing a pickup in fee income associated with those accounts. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. On the credit on the credit front, I know your guidance -- and you indicated that losses are likely to continue to rise here. And given that expectation, if you do see charge-offs continue to rise, you do expect that given what you know now that that could lead to incremental reserve releases from here? David Turner : Well, let me start and I\u2019ll let Barb kind of weigh in. So, I want to be careful about the word reserve releases. We clearly believe we have our allowance to establish at the appropriate amount to cover losses in our portfolio through the life of the loan. As we go forward, we\u2019re going to have charge-offs. If we did it right, those charge-offs are completely reserved for. And so, you\u2019ll see reductions in the reserve as a result of that event. The question is then what do you do with the remaining reserve and how does that reserve -- what\u2019s the adequacy of that reserve for what\u2019s left? And right now, we think we have it. We\u2019ll have to continue to evaluate that at the end of each quarter, looking at all the variables, which include loan growth or not. How the portfolio mix may have changed with the macroeconomic variables? There\u2019s a host of things that go into that. When you say the word reserve release, that contemplates our reserve to $100 today and tomorrow, I figured out I only need $90, so I take $10 million to income. We don\u2019t anticipate that movement at this juncture. There is still uncertainty out there. We need to be real careful about that and make sure we\u2019ve established loan loss reserves at the appropriate level, which we believe we have done. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, David. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m just -- I should have really said all else equal. So, barring a change in the outlook and aside from reserves for new loan production, just as charge-offs go against what you\u2019ve reserved that that should imply that you\u2019ve already reserved for that and there could be reductions for that, like you said. So, that\u2019s fine. My other question on the credit front was, does the reserve already factor in some -- the likelihood of incremental credit migration into criticized assets? So, in other words, if we do see a continued upward trend there that -- do you expect that that could drive incremental additions, or is that factored in? David Turner : Yes. So, when we look at life of loan, we obviously have a lot of migration studies and analysis we\u2019ve looked at. So, we can tell you when things start to age what\u2019s going to happen and they\u2019ll go into special mention and substandard, doubtful, loss. And so, we contemplate that as we establish our reserve level. So, unless there\u2019s a change over what we\u2019ve already estimated, we wouldn\u2019t have incremental reserves for that migration. John Pancari : And then, if I could just ask one more. Sorry. On the loan growth front, does your comment to Ken regarding the loan growth outlook near term, does it imply that we could potentially see some incremental declines in loan balances near term, or do you expect more stable? David Turner : I think that for -- in the short term, we\u2019re doing a couple of things. The question is, has the repayment of the lines bottomed out yet or not. Some have called that it has, we\u2019re not so sure. So that\u2019s a piece of the risk that we have on loan growth. Our production is nice. We do have some runoff portfolios, as you know. And I think net-net, probably not going to see a lot of loan growth to maybe some downward, and that\u2019s what equates to the -- maybe we have NII flat to modestly lower. So, all that\u2019s baked in together. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: I just want to follow up on the comments about the timing of net charge-offs speaking, maybe mid-next year. We\u2019ve heard kind of a similar theme from other banks mid-next year, back half next year. Is that more just like a placeholder since you don\u2019t expect a material increase in the near term, or is there something kind of in the kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the commercial and consumer side that gives you confidence in that mid-next year? Barb Godin : Matt, it\u2019s Barb. I\u2019ll take that question. Yes, the reason that we say mid next year is given all of the deferral programs that are out there. And again, we have that uncertainty as to what\u2019s going to happen, will we get a second set of relief from the government or not relative to the programs they have, et cetera? But based on what we know and just the way that things roll through the various delinquency buckets, we would think that mid-next year, sometime in the second quarter, probably toward the end of the second quarter, could even push into the third quarter. So, there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty and volatility. And that\u2019s the reason we think based on all of that, it\u2019s probably a midyear event next year. John Turner : Fair to say in the C&I book, it\u2019s more -- potentially more predictable. But, even there with small business because of the relief that\u2019s in -- currently in -- circulating through the economy, still hard to predict. So, more a placeholder than necessarily a formal... Barb Godin : That\u2019s right. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then, on the commercial real estate, does that end up being longer tailed than maybe traditional C&I and consumer, just given some of the dynamics with real estate. And, I think a lot of the commercial real estate out there is kind of pretty low LTV. So, there should be some patients on the part of the bank to help work that out? Barb Godin : There is, and we\u2019re spending a lot of time with our customers on a one by one basis, making amendments where we need to, helping them get through what is a rough period. We don\u2019t want to be fair weather bankers by any stretch. But, we are taking a very prudent approach in our discussions with our customers. If we see that at the end of the day, there isn\u2019t a light at the end of the tunnel, then we\u2019re having those hard discussions with them now. But in general, the discussions have been very, very good relative to all of us working together to get through the other side of this. John Turner : And I would say, the thing that comes through in our commercial real estate portfolio is, since the financial crisis, we\u2019ve remade that business. We\u2019ve significantly reduced the amount of exposure we have. We\u2019ve rebuilt the teams that are originating commercial real estate loans. We\u2019re banking very experienced regional and national developers that have good access to capital, a lot of liquidity. They\u2019re involved in quality projects in really solid markets. Strong loan-to-value, it\u2019s a combination of all those things comes together. We feel good about our investor real estate portfolio. Operator : The next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : First, Barb, congratulations. It\u2019s been great working with you all these years. So, really appreciate it. One question for you. Maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks, but you\u2019ve got the NCO guide for 3Q -- I\u2019m sorry, for 4Q in the 55 to 65-bp range. And I thought last quarter -- I was looking more for 80. So, I\u2019m wondering, is this step down in expectation for NCOs something that you think is temporary, given everything we\u2019ve discussed with the stimulus or do you feel like there\u2019s -- the run rate is going to be a little bit lower than what you had been anticipating before? Barb Godin : Thank you very much, Betsy. Firstly, I thought growing old would take a lot longer than it did, but I guess it\u2019s come. Secondly, relative to your question, yes, we started off the quarter. We had a different view of the quarter. We thought that things would not turn out as they did with our customers. Our customers have made a lot of changes to the way in which they\u2019re managing their finances, et cetera. They seem to be holding up better than what we thought. Having said all of that, there\u2019s still a lot of volatility. And so, our issue is more one around timing. And so, as we look at that and we look at what the impacts of these deferral programs and other things are. We do think that there\u2019s still going to be an impact, but it\u2019s just going to be pushed out sometime into \u201821 now. Betsy Graseck : Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, just follow-up is just a question about the footprint and what you\u2019re seeing. You\u2019re in a warmer part of the country. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any kind of in migration. Are you seeing business trends in the southern regions accelerate or retain faster speeds than what you see in the northern part of your region? And maybe you could give us some color on that. I\u2019m just asking the question with the backdrop of when you could start to see some loan growth pick up as well and should you be advantaged, given your footprint? Maybe you could speak to that. Thanks. John Turner : Yes. It\u2019s a great question. I would say specifically about the states in the southeast, where 86% plus or minus where our deposits are, those states were where some of the last to shelter in place and the first to reopen their economies. In fact, 7 of the 10 states we operate -- 7 of the states we operate in were amongst the first 10 to reopen their economies. And as a result of that, generally speaking, the unemployment rates in those states was 200 basis points less than the national average. While the totals were still high, a number of small businesses that closed were more like 50% to 60% of small businesses versus a higher number for the national average. And I\u2019d say, today, we anticipate 85% to 90% of small businesses have reopened. So, the economies seem to be a little better than, let\u2019s say, the Northeast, where, it\u2019s my impression, anyway, based upon what I hear, the number of small businesses there reopening hasn\u2019t been as -- hasn\u2019t occurred as quickly as it has, let\u2019s say, in the South or even in the Midwest markets that we operate in. And we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Recognize that the economy still is fragile. There are health issues, they\u2019re social issues or economic issues, unsure about the political environment. But, based upon what we see, there is an in-migration of people into the Southeastern markets in particular, leaving some of the larger cities in the North and Midwest and coming to the South. And so, real estate values while increasing are solid. We don\u2019t see a real imbalance there or run-up in pricing, but a lot of demand. And there\u2019s availability for jobs, workers here in the south. So, I think, again, we feel pretty good, cautiously optimistic about the economy, recognizing that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Scouten of Piper Sandler. Stephen Scouten : I wanted to follow back around, maybe thinking about the loan loss reserve and the kind of CECL methodology. Appreciating not wanting to call it releasing reserves, but I\u2019m wondering how we could think about what\u2019s maybe elevated due to the pandemic? And what would be a more normalized level if we didn\u2019t have maybe some elevated allocations to expected losses here in the near-term? And where that could kind of normalize over time? David Turner : Well, I do think one of the things you can look at is we show you an allocation in our Q of our allowance by major loan category. And you could see how that compares to the allowance that existed pre-pandemic. And that\u2019ll give you an indication of where we\u2019re seeing elevated loss expectations. The problem with CECL is you\u2019re having to guess through the entire life of the loan. We use a two-year reasonable and supportable period of time. We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic. There\u2019s a lot of volatility with macroeconomic variables. There\u2019s a lot of volatility with certain industries, quick-serve restaurant, energy transportation -- certain elements of transportation, hospitality. All those things require a lot of input to try to figure out what the allowance should be. So, if you look at our high-risk areas and you started seeing that improvement, which we improved $8.4 billion of the higher risk category to $6.6 billion, you can look at those categories, go back and look at the allocation of the reserve, and that will give you some idea as to where that reserve exists for us today and where those improvements over time might come from. Until we see more clarity with regards to the economy, we don\u2019t see any need to change the reserves that we have already calculated. And that can change from quarter-to-quarter. Stephen Scouten : Right. Okay. But, if the pandemic weren\u2019t occurring, instead of 270 in a CECL environment, would you think the reserve would be more in the 170 sort of range, Or is that just too difficult to say? David Turner : Well, it\u2019s too difficult to say, but an indicator, if you want to just go back and look at our pre-pandemic level that we had, our adoption of CECL 1/1 of this year, and that will give you an idea of what we think because at that time, the pandemic hadn\u2019t happened, at least in the United States. So, we that\u2019s we brought -- I\u2019m sorry, thought the actual reserve level ought to be. Stephen Scouten : Perfect, helpful. And then, one last question. Just on the excess liquidity, you talked about you might see additional deposit growth this quarter, but how are you guys, I guess, thinking about that and the stickiness of that excess liquidity maybe over the next year? And what you might do in the fourth quarter and beyond in terms of uses of that liquidity much as you did this quarter? David Turner : Yes. That\u2019s kind of centered on an earlier question. But, I think that the growth in our deposits have come from growth in checking accounts and operating accounts, in addition to existing customers that had cash that was off balance sheet, looking for a better return -- a better yield than we were paying at the time. And because rates have gone down, there\u2019s really no place to go. So, the cash has come back to us in the form of deposits. Also, our customers are generating income, our commercial customers are generating income, and they\u2019re not spending that at the pace they had before, so the cash is piling up on their balance sheets. They\u2019ve worked on their working capital. They\u2019re turning receivables and inventory much faster. All that improves the cash cycle, which ends up as deposits on our balance sheet. So, the question is, at what point will they start using that? And I think it\u2019s when we get back to feeling much better about the economy. They start spending fixed capital investment, whatever the case may be, to utilize that excess cash, if you will, first, and then it gets into loan growth for us after that. Part of the reason we\u2019re not spending or putting to work the excess cash we have at the Fed, which is about $10 billion round numbers, is because to take the duration risk today, you don\u2019t get paid a whole lot, incrementally more than 10 basis points at the Fed. But, we think there\u2019s prospects for steepening of the yield curve, regardless of who wins the election. And with that and higher inflation can give us a better opportunity to deploy that excess cash than we have today. If we see deposits continuing to grow at a faster clip, then we\u2019ll step up our investments into the securities book, as you just saw us do with the $3 billion this past quarter. So, it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s a balancing act that we\u2019re trying to take with -- obviously, our liquidity is very good, but trying to get yield and opportunity -- our opportunity costs to make sure we can deploy that best we can. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : You guys have obviously done a great job managing expenses, [indiscernible] and grow and [indiscernible]. I know it\u2019s early, but would you expect to hold expenses relatively flat again next year? And what are some of the things that you\u2019re looking at for additional expense initiatives? David Turner : Yes. So, it\u2019s great question. We\u2019ve done, we think, a really good job of holding our expenses relatively stable up over the past several years, few years, less than 1%. We\u2019re going to continue to work on that as we get into 2021, and we\u2019ll give you better guidance as we get towards the end of the year. But, the things that we look at, we\u2019re certainly wanting to leverage our Continuous Improvement process that John Turner put in -- had us put in, that really forces us to get better at whatever we\u2019re doing every day, process improvement, leveraging technology. The drivers of our cost base, clearly, number one, our salaries and benefits. It\u2019s people cost. It\u2019s still 55% of our expense base. So, how do we control our headcount matters. And as we think about that, clearly, there is a lot of people, almost half of our people are in our branch network, and we\u2019ve consolidated an awful lot of branches over time. We continue to look at branch consolidations. We think that\u2019s been a big driver of our cost savings. We have now got it down path. We know when we consolidate a branch, what that means for revenue and customers. And so, our consumer team is doing a great job of evaluating every one of our branches to see how tight we can continue to make that. And as we do, we\u2019ll save in terms of headcount there. We\u2019re looking -- every area has to look at spans and layers and the commitment to our -- to headcount, how can we leverage technology so that when we have attrition, we have technology that can take place, and we won\u2019t have to backfill that person. Occupancy is another area. Again, that\u2019s tied to both, branches and the back office. We\u2019ve continued to work on consolidating square footage, and we\u2019re happy about that. As we get our headcount down, furniture fixtures and equipment, which are computers that people have, also comes down. Third party spend, we have a Head of Procurement that\u2019s pretty tough on all of our vendors. And he\u2019s also pretty tough on all of us because it\u2019s a demand management approach where we think we might need a consultant, and he says, you sure about that. And that goes for all of us in the company. I know he\u2019s smiling at that. But, we really have to watch that spend. We have to watch travel and entertainment. That\u2019s coming down because of COVID. So, we have places and levers to pull on expenses. It\u2019s really hard because we have to make investments in technology, in digital, in people to continue to grow revenue and grow customers for our Company. So, while we\u2019re doing that, how do we keep our expenses flat, and it\u2019s all the savings we just mentioned are areas that we\u2019re focusing on. Peter Winter : And if I could just ask one more. Can you guys just give an update on your thoughts around M&A when we get a more certain environment? John Turner : Yes. Our views about M&A haven\u2019t changed, Peter, to this point. I mean, we continue to focus on bank M&A. We\u2019ve made a number of successful acquisitions of smaller firms that provide additional capabilities in wealth management and capital markets and the mortgage business, acquiring mortgage servicing rights, low-income housing tax credit syndicator, M&A advisory firm, things that you\u2019re aware of. And we continue to have aspirations to do that. Having said that, we believe that we are still in an environment where it\u2019s in our best interest to just focus on executing our plan with respect to bank M&A. If we do that, then we believe that our shareholders will benefit. That will be reflected in our share price, the multiple that we trade at. And then, we can talk about whether or not we have some interest in bank M&A. But today, our focus is still on executing our plan. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : So, David, just one follow-up question for me. As we think about a starting point on the net interest margin estimate in nonrecurring items of 3.11, how should we think about as so that margin of 3.3%? Clearly, you\u2019re doing a great job in terms of defending the margin. And I guess, how should we think about the excess cash and what you need to see in the marketplace to more aggressively deploy that excess cash or that your GAAP NIM more reflects that core NIM that you point out? David Turner : Yes. So, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s a balancing act that we\u2019re trying to make with regards to being paid for duration and putting that excess cash to work there or waiting for the yield curve to steepen a bit, which we think if we\u2019re just a little bit patient, we can actually have a better earning asset. We understand every day we wait though, we\u2019re trading off 1% change for 10 basis points. We did put some of that excess cash to work as we mentioned and kind of perversely that when we give you our core NIM, right anything that\u2019s sitting at the Fed and the Fed account, we\u2019re carving out from our margin. But when we deploy some of that, as we did our $3 billion, it\u2019s earning 1%, that weighs on our core NIM. It helps us on NII, but it hurts our NIM. So, whereas we were in the high 3.30s before we decided to deploy the cash, we think we\u2019re going to be in that 3.30-ish range. So, that deployment actually cost us 6 basis points of NIM, but it helped our NII. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too wound up on the NIM calculation just yet. I would look at the ability to grow net interest income and having the dry powder to deploy and better loan growth when that comes along or a steeper yield curve when that happens. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Congratulations, Barb. Barb Godin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Maybe you guys can share with us -- and Barb, congratulations on your retirement and your insights over the years. And the first question is about credit. We all understand what the government has done has been pretty impressive in terms of the stimulus relief. The Federal Reserve is obviously aggressively moved to bring in spreads in the open market. And we have the forbearance program. Can you guys share with us what have been the big differences between credit because the economy collapsed and all the metrics we became accustomed to like the unemployment rate, leading to higher consumer net charge-offs. Those relationships haven\u2019t held up in this downturn, and I\u2019m wondering what -- other than the programs I mentioned, maybe that\u2019s the answer, What\u2019s so different about this downturn do you think versus what we saw in \u201806 and \u201807 going into \u201808, \u201809? Barb Godin : Yes. Gerard, I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s Barb. I do think the stimulus relief is really the linchpin here. It\u2019s the largest thing. But also, our consumers and our businesses have changed their habits as well. For example, for consumers, what we\u2019re seeing is they\u2019re not spending their money on things like the $10,000 vacation. That money is now just going into the bank and putting it away for it quotes around the word of rainy day. The rainy day is here. They\u2019re being very prudent with their money. Of course, the stimulus has really helped with that. To make sure they build a bit of an estate for themselves as they work their way through to better times. We\u2019re seeing that on the consumer side most definitely. And you can -- I thought perhaps maybe we would therefore see a lot of draw-downs in things like, on the consumer side, our home equity lines. We haven\u2019t seen that. Or cash out refis on our mortgages. We haven\u2019t seen that neither. So, they\u2019re being --consumers are being very, very good about the way they\u2019re going about spending their money. On the business side, it\u2019s the same thing. Businesses have set back. And they\u2019ve enjoyed several years of good profitability. They too are looking at what does this mean for them? What does this mean for their business? What do I have to do to make the changes now? So, I\u2019ve been pretty impressed with the resiliency of our economy, particularly here in the South where we are where we\u2019ve seen a lot of businesses and the consumers make the appropriate changes. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s really different than last time. As well, last time around, as we all know Gerard, it was a meltdown in the mortgage -- the housing market. That\u2019s not happened this time. If anything, the mortgage market is a little bit on fire relative to purchase as well as refi, and that\u2019s all because of the low rates. So, that too is something that we\u2019re also keeping our eye out for. David Turner : Gerard, let me add to that. So, as you think about the Southeast and Regions in particular, commercial real estate is nothing like it was. One, we don\u2019t have near the commitment to it that we had at that time. Second is the real estate values haven\u2019t collapsed. To Barb\u2019s point, that was a massive change in values on not only consumers and mortgages, but on homebuilders and things of that nature. We don\u2019t have that today. If you go look at disposable income, disposable income for consumers continues to grow. As you look at the financial obligation ratio, so the percentage of payments of disposable income that\u2019s being used for debt payments is very low. And part of that is the leverage is -- the total leverage is actually higher in consumer. The ability to pay is much lower because the rate environment is so low. And then, the last thing would be unemployment isn\u2019t all that even either. So, you have to think about where is that really happening. And as John mentioned, the unemployment rate for us in our markets is a couple of hundred basis points lower than other parts of the country. So, it\u2019s the major metros that seem to have fared worse on that unemployment than kind of the second-tier markets where we happen to operate a lot of our business. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I appreciate the color. And then, as a follow-up, David, can you share with us your margin and your net interest income? You guys have done a very good job in managing it as you\u2019ve described for us. What kind of interest rate environment in, let\u2019s say, 2021 or 2022 would be less favorable to the way you\u2019re positioned today? What are you kind of on the lookout for in terms of rates going forward that could be less favorable than what you\u2019re seeing today? David Turner : Well, I think, not just for us but for most banks, a flat yield curve is pretty -- is problematic. We have no expectations of short rates moving either way. And frankly, we really don\u2019t care where they go because we\u2019re virtually insulated on the low rates. Our biggest risk is kind of in the middle to the end of the curve where we\u2019re having to redeploy our maturing fixed rate loans and securities. And for us, that\u2019s about $12 billion over a 12-month period of time. So, taking those cash flows and reinvesting them in this kind of rate environment where the 10-year is at lower -- at 70 whatever basis points today, it\u2019s tough to make money. And so, if we can get a steepener going, which we think we can with infrastructure spending again it doesn\u2019t matter who really wins the election on that, maybe the Democrats do it quicker, but we\u2019ll see. But I think a steepening yield curve is what we like to see, but flat is bad. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And Barb, I hope on you\u2019re going away part already is a main loss to David and John. Barb Godin : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : A couple of quick follow-ups. First, I know you\u2019re not assuming any acceleration in PPP forgiveness income in the fourth quarter. But, can you just tell us what your best guess is currently for forgiveness rate? And what the timing of that forgiveness could be over the first half of \u201821 and maybe even into the second half of \u201821. If you could just kind of give us what your best estimate is right now? David Turner : Yes. So, as we think about the fourth quarter early on, we thought we would see a reasonable amount of forgiveness in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve had some, but it hadn\u2019t been enough to really talk about. We think that\u2019s been pushed into the first quarter. I think, we get through the election, maybe we get a little bit more clarity. They have come up with a forgiveness form that\u2019s fairly tight that I think could be helpful. We\u2019ll see -- what we haven\u2019t seen is the borrowers actually calling and saying, I\u2019m ready for my forgiveness. They\u2019re kind of hanging out because it\u2019s not really costing them anything at this point. So, we need to -- if we get a little bit of pressure there, maybe we start getting a little more request for forgiveness. Is it the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter? I mean, we don\u2019t know. Today, we earn a little less than 2% off of the PPP loan, and that is the rate plus a portion of the fees that we have to recognize on the effective interest method. So, it weighs on our margin, which is why we carve it out for the analysis, and we\u2019ve given you the dollar amount now right at $30 million. So, I don\u2019t know when that could happen, but -- probably the middle of \u201821. Saul Martinez : Right. But just to be absolutely 100% clear, your guidance for the fourth quarter, that\u2019s not assuming any acceleration in PPP fee income and\u2026 David Turner : That\u2019s correct. Saul Martinez : Okay. All right. And then, if I could just pivot and ask you about your reserving and kind of going to the waterfall, your ACL waterfall. You had -- your reserve levels were flat. And so, essentially, what you term is portfolio risk and balances one-for-one offset charge-offs and I guess, an improved economic outlook. And just curious what that portfolio risk and balances entails? Because in an environment where you had controlling loans and it\u2019s not clear that your mix became riskier, more tilted towards high loss content loans, that effectively keeping reserves flat effectively means that you\u2019re reserving more on your back book and you\u2019re estimating higher loss content on your back book. So I\u2019m just curious that we should view that more as sort of a mindset where you don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate yet to reduce reserves and note that I didn\u2019t use reserve releases, but the falling reserves, or is there something else? And I guess, the adjunct to that is, what would make you confident enough to the point where you actually start to see falling ACL levels and lower absolute dollar reserve levels? Barb Godin : Yes. That would be -- right now, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, as we talked about already in the call relative to what we think what\u2019s going to happen in the economy. We really don\u2019t know. And so, with that heightened level of uncertainty, it doesn\u2019t give us a warm feeling that we should go ahead and start releasing reserves. We just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. A lot of volatility that comes with uncertainty, of course, the two go hand-in-hand. And so we just don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent or appropriate at this point in the economic cycle that we\u2019re in for us to go ahead and start releasing less or providing less. So, that\u2019s what the thinking is behind that. David Turner : Yes. We do have production of new loans every quarter. Even though the gross number may not change, we do have production. We do have some of our, as you mentioned, bad book. We do have some that we\u2019ve increased reserves on. We have certain loans we look at loan by loan, some we look at portfolios, and there are certain of those that we add into this particular quarter. And as I said, it\u2019s just hard to tell what will happen next quarter. We have to get to the end and see what the facts and circumstances are at that time. Saul Martinez : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s just simply a function of you\u2019re just feeling confident that the economy is on a more sound footing. And at that point, you would feel comfortable reducing reserves. Because effectively, it almost seems like reducing reserves is almost calling the end of the credit cycle right now. And so, I\u2019m just like curious if that\u2019s the way you look at, or it\u2019s just really simply a function of having a more-clear outlook on the glide path of the economy is feeling more strongly about it? David Turner : To the extent you ignore the reduction in reserves that come through charge-offs because that\u2019s a given\u2026 Saul Martinez : Yes. David Turner : The rest of it -- yes, reducing reserves after that would have to have more clarity with regards to the economy and the performance of our portfolios over their remaining life of the loans. That\u2019s exactly right. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : I wanted to ask about the return on tangible common equity trajectory, when we pull all the pieces together that you\u2019ve all discussed on the call. So putting up the lowest efficiency ratio in over a decade in this environment obviously stands out, then layering in the expense savings that you discussed, branch optimization and everything else, and then the NII benefits from noninterest-bearing deposit mix rising to the highest level we\u2019ve seen at 42%. And it seems like we can kind of see your ROTCE continue to rise to all-time highs as we look ahead. It feels a little bit unusual to be talking about high ROTCEs in a recession where we haven\u2019t even see losses rise yet. But, I was hoping you could give a little bit of color around when we pull all the pieces together and think about ROTCE, how you see that trajectory? David Turner : Yes. I think, if you were to look at generally commercial banking in this environment, normalized provisioning for this environment, it is a low rate environment. So, we think returns are in that 12% to 14% range. You can get a given quarter that would be outside of those boundaries. But, if you kind of look all in, we think that\u2019s a reasonable return. I think, banks can earn their -- more than their cost of capital and generate shareholder value, just not at the level we would have if we had a much higher steeper yield curve where we could have margins that are in that 3.50% to 3.75% range we talked about at our Investor Day some years ago that drove returns up much higher than that 12% to 14%. So, I think that\u2019s probably where we are at the moment, but we\u2019re continuing to work hard to make it better. And that\u2019s what our Continuous Improvement is all about. Bill Carcache : Understood. Following up on your earlier comments about a steepener and the benefits there. Can you give a little bit more color on your exposure to the short versus the long ends of the curve? And any sensitivity in terms of benefit to NII would be really helpful. David Turner : On the short rates, we really don\u2019t have any exposure there. We\u2019re pretty much mitigated there. So, long end that -- and kind of the middle of the curve that pose most of the risk to us. I think again, it\u2019s because we have $12 billion of cash flows coming out of our fixed rate loan and securities portfolios that we have to reinvest that caused the biggest challenge to us there. And the front book, back book, if you want to call it that is about 1 point different -- difference between what\u2019s rolling off and what we can put it to work at in a reasonable way today. That\u2019s where the risk is. John Turner : Operator, do we have any more questions? Operator : Your final question is from Jennifer Demba with Truist Securities. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. Congratulations, Barb. We\u2019re going to miss working with you. Barb Godin : Thank you so much, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : My question is on mortgage banking fees. They\u2019ve obviously been at record levels the couple of quarters. What are you guys seeing in terms of production trends in the fourth quarter and beyond as this home buying frenzy continues? David Turner : Yes. So, we\u2019ve been very pleased. We hit a record this quarter in terms of mortgage. If you go back to the list of these earnings calls, we say mortgage is strong and it should be strong next quarter. It got even stronger and really benefiting from the consumer banking group\u2019s decision to hire mortgage loan originators a couple of years ago in preparation for a low rate environment like we anticipated. So, we\u2019re benefiting from that. We think the fourth quarter, based on what\u2019s in the pipeline is going to be strong. Whether it could be as strong as the third quarter? Don\u2019t yet know. But, we think it\u2019s set up for a very strong 2021. And a big reason for that confidence is that as you know, historically, we\u2019ve been a purchase shop, mainly 70% to 30%. Today, our mix is about 50-50 in terms of refinance and purchase. Both of them are strong. Refis won\u2019t continue forever. We understand that. But, we\u2019ve been a pretty strong purchase job, unlike others who had actually 70% refi, 30% purchase. So, we think the fourth quarter will be good. We think all of \u201821 will be pretty good too. Will we meet the levels we\u2019re at right now? I don\u2019t know. John Turner : Okay. Well, I think that\u2019s the last call we had. So, really appreciate your interest and thank you for participating in the call today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shelby, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. John and David will provide some high-level commentary regarding the quarter and full-year results. Earnings documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, and the Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thanks, Dana, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results. We achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate and operating environment. Earlier this morning, we reported full-year earnings of $991 million, reflecting our highest level of adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income in more than a decade, resulting in adjusted positive operating leverage of 2.6%. Over the last 10-plus years, we've made significant strides toward our goal of positioning the company to generate consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We've enhanced our credit, interest rate and operational risk management processes and platforms. We've sharpened our focus on appropriate risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. These actions position us well to weather the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and to serve as a strong foundation for growth. Despite a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we remain focused on what we can control and our efforts are paying off. During 2020, we grew consumer and small business checking accounts by 1.5%. We increased corporate loan production by 6%. We made investments in talent, target markets, technology, and digital capabilities, and we expanded and enhanced products across the consumer and corporate bank, incorporating changing customer preferences and learnings from the pandemic. In 2021 and beyond, we will continue to focus on growing our business by investing in areas that allow us to make banking easier for our customers and while continuing to provide our associates with the tools they need to be competitive. We will make incremental adjustments to our business by leveraging our strengths and investing in areas where we believe we can consistently win over time. We did this by adding mortgage loan originators when rates were still rising, positioning us to better capitalize on mortgage activity. We also expanded our small business platform through the Ascentium acquisition, as well as our enhanced SBA technology platform. In closing, we're very proud of our achievements in 2020, but none of these will be possible without the hard work and dedication of our 20,000 associates. This year has posed a myriad of challenges. However, our associates took action, providing best-in-class customer service, successfully executing on our strategy, and maintaining strong risk management practices in the face of a rapidly evolving operating environment, all of which contributed to our success. Now, Dave will provide you with some details regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. While adjusted average loans were up for the year, they decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 25% compared to the third quarter. However, balances remain negatively impacted by historically low utilization levels. As of year-end, commercial line utilization was just under 40% compared to historical average of 45%. Commercial loan balances were further impacted by the company's active portfolio management efforts during the quarter. Approximately $408 million worth of commercial loans were either sold or transferred to held for sale. Additionally, PPP forgiveness began during the quarter resulting in a $415 million reduction in average loan balances. Consumer loan growth, again, reflected strong mortgage production offset by runp-off portfolios. Overall, we expect 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low-single-digits compared to 2020. However, after excluding the impact of this quarter's portfolio management efforts, we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low-single-digits. With respect to deposits, balances continue to increase this quarter to new record levels. Full-year average deposits are 17% higher than 2019 with most of the growth coming in noninterest bearing to core operating accounts across all three business segments. The increase is primarily due to higher balances. However, we are also experiencing new account growth. We expect near-term deposit balances will continue to increase particularly as the second round of stimulus is dispersed. Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Net interest income increased 2% during the quarter, and as expected income increased 2% during the quarter, and as expected, remained relatively stable excluding the benefit from PPP forgiveness. Similar to prior quarters the impact from lower loan balances and low long term rates was mostly offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs, and higher average notional values of active loan hedges. Net interest margin was stable in link quarter at 3.13%. Deposit growth drove cash we hold at the Federal Reserve to record levels averaging over $13 billion and reducing fourth quarter margin by 34 basis points. PPP benefited net interest income through the realization of approximately $24 million of fees related to forgiveness. In total, the PPP program contributed 7 basis points to the margin. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.4%, evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a near zero short term rate environment. Loan hedges added $97 million to net interest income and 30 basis points to the margin. Higher average hedged notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the third quarter. Our last four starting hedges began earlier this month. So going forward, we expect roughly $100 million of hedge related interest income in each quarter at current rate levels until hedges begin to mature in late 2023. Our hedges have a remaining life of four years and provide protection for 2026. We continue to look for opportunities to deploy excess cash, balancing risk and return. Of note, incremental securities currently come with larger premiums, which increased our quarterly premium amortization run rate, but that is factored into the overall net benefit. Total premium amortization was $51 million this quarter and would be in the low $40 million range excluding booked premium increases and elevated Ginnie Mae buy-out activity. Interest-bearing deposit costs fell 6 basis points in the quarter to 13 basis points, contributing $10 million to net interest income. Looking ahead to the first quarter, PPP-related net interest income is expected to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter. However, the timing of PPP loan forgiveness and participation in the second round of funding remains uncertain. Fewer days will reduce first quarter NII by roughly $12 million. After level setting for days, net interest income is expected to be modestly lower quarter-over-quarter, mostly attributable to lower average loan balances. The impact of lower -- long-term rates will continue to be offset by the benefits from hedging, cash management strategies, and lower deposit costs. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income increased 7% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved record capital markets income driven primarily by increased M&A activity. Mortgage delivered another solid quarter and for the full year, generated record production and related revenue. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect mortgage and capital markets to continue to be significant contributors to fee revenue. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million on average. Service charges increased 5% but remain below prior year levels. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as continued enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction postings are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. Although we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels. Card and ATM fees have recovered compared to the prior year, driven primarily by increased debit card expense. And while credit cards spend continues to improve, it remains slightly behind prior year levels. Given the timing of interest rate changes in 2020, combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP forgiveness and loan growth. Let\u2019s move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased 5% in the quarter, driven by higher incentive compensation related primarily to record capital markets activities. Although base salaries were 2% lower compared to the third quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process, associate headcount decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 1% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of our Ascentium acquisition, the associate headcount decreased over 3% in 2020. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products, and people to grow our business. In 2021, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to remain stable to down modestly compared to 2020. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time but acknowledged 2021 will be challenging without a stronger economy than currently anticipated. From an asset quality perspective, overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Annualized net charge-offs were 43 basis points, a 7-basis point improvement over the prior quarter, reflecting improvement primarily within our commercial portfolios. Non-performing loans, total delinquencies, and business services criticize loans all remained relatively stable. Our allowance for credit losses declined 5 basis points to 2.69% of total loans and 308% of total non-accrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.81% of total loans. The decline in reserves reflects stabilization in our economic outlook and improved credit performance, charge-offs previously provided for, and the impact of active portfolio management. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $38 million benefit to the provision. Our year-end allowance remains one of the highest in our peer group as measured against a period-in loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. As we look forward, we are mindful of the uncertainty that exists in the economy due to the pandemic. However, we are mindful of the uncertainty that exists in the economy due to the pandemic. However, we are cautiously optimistic as we move beyond events before the source of uncertainty in prior quarters. Further reductions in the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. While charge-offs can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, we currently expect full-year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 55 to 65 basis points. Additionally, based on what we know today, we continue to expect charge-offs to peak in mid-2021. With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 9.8% inside of our current operating range of 9.5% to 10%. In the near term, we intend to operate at the higher end of this range. So, wrapping up, on the next slide are our 2021 expectations which we have already addressed. So, in summary, we are cautiously optimistic about 2021. Pretax pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well controlled, credit quality is showing resilience, capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic on the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Good morning. David, the first one is for you, as we think about total adjusted revenue, how should we -- expectations, how should we think about what you're thinking about PPP 2.0 participation and also whether or not loans originated in PPP 2.0 are going to be forgiven in 2021? And the second part of that question is you have seven times as much cash as you did a year ago -- a quarter year ago and also what your expectations are for where those cash levels level out in 2021? David Turner : Okay. Well, good morning. Let me start with PPP, so we originated about $5 billion for the PPP loans this year. Now, the rules were changing early on as you know and some of our customers actually gave us money back before we really earned much yield on it. So at the end of the year, as you can see on our page 20 in the supplement, PPP loans amount to $3.6 billion at December 31. We forgave approximately $1 billion for the loans in 2020 and that was really in the fourth quarter where we generated from the forgiveness piece alone $24 million that we disclosed to you. As we think about PPP 2.0, we estimate at least at this time, that we'd originate approximately $2 billion in PPP loans. Now, the timing and the ultimate amount of that is uncertain as is the forgiveness with the existing $3.6 billion. So we've given you the pieces that you can do some scenario analysis in terms of how you think that may come into income. Clearly, loans that are forgiven quicker come into 2021 and would help from a revenue standpoint. Your second piece of the question is on cash. So, you're right. We do have quite a bit of cash. Our deposit growth was quite strong during the year both in Consumer and Wealth, and also in the Corporate Banking group. So all three of those had nice growth. We have deployed some of that cash in the securities book as you've seen and we have gotten a little bit of steepening of late. The problem is mortgage spreads is tight another way and, therefore, you really don't have a great place to put the cash, and we're reluctant to take on duration risk at this time. And that being said, we are mindful of more stimulus, could steepen out even further, which would give us a better entry point to put that cash. But until we see that, we really are going to have that cash at the Fed earning 10 basis points, which we understand does weigh on our revenue but we think that's the most prudent path. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is for John. Kudos to you and your team for trading at 1.5 times tangible book in the middle of a global pandemic. Really fit the balance sheet management and the expense management that your team has executed. I'm wondering as you emerge from this crisis stronger you know what your thoughts are on using that currency for inorganic opportunities. John Turner : Erika, our point of view on that really hasn't changed. We want to continue to look for opportunities to make nonbank acquisitions, to expand our capabilities, to help us grow and diversify our revenue. We think the acquisitions that we've made over the last few years have proven to be fruitful as evidenced by over the last few years have proven to be fruitful, as evidenced by, as an example, the great quarter that we had in capital markets, largely driven by M&A activity. We also had a good quarter in low-income housing tax credits and syndications of that business. Ascentium Capital, we\u2019re excited about what we think it can mean for the future. So that's our primary focus. With respect to bank acquisitions, our view of that -- about that hasn't changed. We think we have a really solid plan if we continue to execute our plan, continue to build a consistently performing, sustainable business that, over time, we will continue to benefit from generating nice returns for our shareholders. Our currency will get stronger. And if an opportunity comes along in the future, we would then have an opportunity to consider it. But our focus is on executing our plan. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the loan side. You give us that nice adjusted number and reconciliation in the back. Just wondering if you can help us understand also underneath that, the auto book and the runoff that's still happening on the portfolio loan sale that you called out. So it looked like that averaged about $2.7 million, the auto stuff in 2020, and you think that's going to look like as you look forward into 2021. John Turner : Well, I think, again, if you go back to that, you\u2019re referring to page 20 in the supplement, and we really want to level-set because our point is if you kind of cut to the core of our business, we think, end-to-end, we can grow loans. We said we'd grow low-single digits, but we'll still -- we're going to continue to have the pace of runoff that you see there with regards to our exit portfolios. You see just in the quarter, we were down some $140 million on indirect other and we were down about $200 million on vehicles. We see that pace continuing the way on total loans. But trying to see the message our core business we're in great markets. We expect there to be somewhat of a rebound but it'll be towards the back half that matter, which really is dependent on the economic recovery. Ken Usdin : Yeah. I understand and that's exactly I was going to follow up David. As you look through the commercial books and like where would you expect that to be seen the most in terms of that economic recovery starting to show up in that regular way loan book? Thanks. John Turner : Yeah. I think a big part of that is going to be in things like health care and would be a big one, financial services, elements of manufacturing we think are also capable of growing. Those are, those will be three areas that we would really point to at this time. Ken Usdin : Got it. And the second question just to -- on the expenses you guys done a very good job holding the line on cost of keeping a close to flat. There are some of the peers are starting to talk about extra investments and fronting of things that might have come over time. Just wanted to hear how you guys are strategically thinking about that? Are you, are you putting in enough as you save to keep flat and how do you think about that strategically as you go forward? Thanks. John Turner : Yeah. So, again we've been pretty consistent with our message on investments. We've invested in people, so mortgage loan originators is an example. Wealth advisors be another one. We've had relationship managers. So, we have to continue to make investments in the people side there. We continue to make investments in technology and cyber and digital. We have to keep doing that to serve our customers. We also are cognizant of the fact that when revenues is challenge, we haven\u2019t forgot how to pay for that so that we can keep our expenses relatively stable to down as we're indicating. So what we do is we look at things like our head count, it's 55% of our costs. We look at occupancy costs. We look at third-party vendors, furniture fixtures and equipment. We've been really good at keeping that cost down. And we're on reef -- continue to focus on it through our continuous improvement program in those same areas in 2021. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thanks David. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jennifer Demba of Truist Securities. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. Just curious about the loan loss reserve and where you see that going over the course of 2021. Do you think this will go back to your day one people reserve level or do you think that might occur more in 2022? David Turner : Yeah. It's a great question and there's a lot of uncertainty with regards to that. You can see our slide that we have that's on page 20 of our deck where we break out the component parts where the reserve is moving. Jennifer, that the -- there's still uncertainty with regards to the economic recovery as evidenced by the federal government stimulus program. So, we need to see more certainty with regards to where we think losses will ultimately be. We think there's a risk that those have been just pushed out a bit, that they're still there. And until we have clarity that they're not, we're going to keep the reserves at an appropriate level. We are mindful of the fact that timing of charge offs matter on the reserves. The macroeconomic factors which we have to measure every quarter end is important to us. And so we think ultimately we can get there when times are good. I\u2019m not confident, we were not confident that that can happen in 2021 and the pace of reserves coming down again will be dependent on the things I've just mentioned. Jennifer Demba : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good. Maybe we get start off David, you guys had an interesting slide in the deck at the back of the deck on the LIBOR transition. The question I have for you is do you think there's any possibility of that drop dead date being pushed out from the end of the year? And then second when you look at that slide one of the top two or three risks that you're focused on to ensure that there's a smooth transition here? David Turner : Well, so answer your first part of that question is there is a chance that this all this gets pushed out a bit. I think what most people are finding is that this is much more difficult than just changing an index. It so, it permeates a lot of our business. I would say our loan book but our derivatives book and how we transition is really important. How we get our systems updated as a risk that we have to be mindful of. From a competitive standpoint what index will our customers prefer to go to and we deal with large customers. And we deal with middle market and small business customers and a lot of our competitors may use a different index. And so we need to transitioning in that front will be important for us. We need to see the term structures continue to develop, so that we can effectively hedge our interest rate risk without having basis risk at same time. So, a lot of contract. It\u2019s just a big body of work, Gerard. And having more time would be helpful. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And John a bigger picture for -- bigger question, a big picture question I should say for you is that reasons obviously your quarter was quite strong, your peers are putting up good numbers as well. The industry appears to be positioned to benefit from this economic recovery that many people are forecasting that time -- that's tied to the vaccine rollout. Can you share with us when you go down the elevator at night, what are the risks that you think about as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months that you don't want to lose sight of? David Turner : Well as I say to our team every day, we can't take anything for granted and we continue to see improvement in our business. We've done a great job I think over the last 10 plus months working through a very challenging environment. The industry has done a great job. We're still confronting a number of crises across the country whether they be health related, the economy, the political environment we're operating in, social unrest all those things potentially impact our business. And so, we can't take anything for granted. We've got to continue to focus on the risks in our business make sure that we are executing well, that we're continuing to recruit our talent internally and externally every day to keep an engaged and active team. And I think we do those things and stay focused we do those things as they focus on things that we can control, which is how we take care of our customers, how we respond to each other. It\u2019s about the investments that we make in technology and in our business. If we do those things, then I think we\u2019re doing a good job of managing the risks that are in our business and we'll deliver that consistent sustainable long-term performance. It's about really focusing on what we can control. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the NCO guide of 55 basis points to 65 basis points for 2021 and just kind of understand how to think about the trajectory among the different asset classes because consumer tends to be fairly mechanistic with the day calendar roll. But C&I and career obviously a little bit more at your discretion. So maybe give a sense as to how we should anticipate the cadence throughout the year goes. John Turner : Yeah. So I think, as we've guided to 55 basis points to 65 basis points and that we believe charge-offs will peak in the first half of the year, that's really a reflection of the fact that our view is we've got some corporate bank or commercial wholesale credits whether they\u2019d be a typical C&I or invest real estate to work through in the first half of the year. On the other hand, consumer which has performed exceptionally well we think will continue to exhibit really good credit quality particularly with the additional stimulus pumped into the economy. And so, if charge-offs rise in the consumer sector, that's likely to be in the second half of the year as it\u2019s the way we think about it. Betsy Graseck : And then these charge-offs are -- you\u2019ve already reserved for them, so we should anticipate release to manage the charge offs as they come through? John Turner : Yeah. I think you got a really -- that word release has always bothered me. But the reserve should go down because of the charge-offs. And then the question is how much do you need in reserve for the remaining portfolio? And so, if you're a portfolio of loans isn't growing and the credit quality isn\u2019t changing and the macroeconomic factors aren't changing, then you wouldn't re-provide because the theory is you already did that. And so that's a straightforward as I know how to make it. Betsy Graseck : Do you like the word match better? John Turner : No. But basically what you're saying is -- my point I don't mean to be flippant but my point is there are two independent thoughts in charge-off or charge-offs. Then you settle down and you figure out what your reserve needs to be under CECL. And you can't, you can't think of it in the context of the old accounting. That's what I'm trying to get about everything. Betsy Graseck : Are you suggesting though that the economy is getting better, you should have reserve release ahead of the net charge off recognition then that's also another possibility? John Turner : That's, that's absolutely right. That's why I would give you the analysis we did on that page 20 to show you what the moving parts are on analyzing the reserve. You got charge offs, you get a change in the outlook and then you have other qualitative factors and model considerations that you have to consider. So you're absolutely right, if the economic outlook continues to get better, then you would expect not to need the reserves that you booked. And that is that's a true release. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And when are you making those reserve decisions is that at the end of the quarter like December 31 or is that something you're doing earlier in the quarter? John Turner : Well, we have our teams -- this is what they do every day, but we\u2019re -- it\u2019s incumbent upon us every balance sheet date to look at the facts that exist at that point in time and make our ultimate determination. So, yeah, as you remember, the first quarter of last year, one week to the next week was dramatic shifts in the macroeconomic environment. So you can't make a call until you get to the end of a quarter. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. And then just separately on CET1, I know your CET1 range that you've given is 9.5% to 10%. And given that you're at 9.8% currently, how does that impact your decision on timing for repurchases? Can you give us a sense as to -- are you waiting until you hit 10% and then commence or anywhere in that range is fair game? John Turner : Well, we said that for the near-term we -- that's our range. We're probably going to want to operate at the higher end of that range just because, as we mentioned minute ago, uncertainty continues in the economy. But 10% is our number right now. If we continue to accrete over that then we would be in position subject to the other regulatory tests that we have to have begun to repurchase our shares. As John mentioned earlier though, we really want to use our capital to grow organically, to grow -- do a nonbank transaction to pay an appropriate dividend. But we will use share repurchases to keep ourselves, at least today, at that -- closer to that 10% level. And it could vary a bit just because what happens right at month end. But if we get clarity that maybe we don't need 10% and it\u2019s something lower than that then we'll readjust our share buyback based on our new capital number. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thanks very much. John Turner : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning, good morning. I appreciate the net interest income details you gave in terms of outlook. I just want to see if you can comment a little bit around the margin and how that could trend for your full year expectation and maybe into next quarter just given the liquidity dynamics as well as obviously the PPP dynamics? Thanks. David Turner : Yeah. John, so I think from a margin standpoint, we do have a little bit of an anomaly. This first quarter we have a two-day change, so it'll hurt us by that $12 million on NII but it'll help the margin a little bit. So you could see that go actually up a little bit. And we think though, if you look at it in total for the year, we think our margin will trend down into that 330 range. And then we're talking about our core margin now ex-cash in PPP. We think the full year margin will be down about 4 or 5 basis points from where we are today. And if we look at with cash and PPP, we think we'll be down 3 or 4 basis points if we look at the full year number. Hopefully that helps you. John Pancari : No, that does, that does. Thank you. And then just want a competitive backdrop, obviously we've seen a lot of activity in terms of recent bank deals in the set that are impacting the Southeast. And can you just talk about are you beginning to see any competitive strain show up either in loan pricing or other areas that were not as obvious even a year ago or so? And then separately, are you seeing opportunities potentially on talent or customer acquisition as a result of those deals, so they\u2019re on your backyard? Thanks. David Turner : Yeah. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re necessarily seeing a change let\u2019s say in competition. There\u2019s a lot of competition because there\u2019s a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market. So, whether it\u2019d be bank competitors, non-bank competitors, when we see good opportunities they\u2019re very competitive. And in fact we recently lost a few what we would characterize as good opportunities to pretty aggressive pricing. Having said that, again I wouldn't say that's a change as a result of new announcements in the marketplace, bank combinations or anything of that nature. Just people looking for opportunities to and particularly I'd say community banks in the middle market space looking to acquire assets and get some yield. With regard to just disruption, I'd say we feel like we've been able to recruit some really quality talent in the market and that's something that we stay focused on all the time. So, whether there is an announced bank transaction creating some disruption or a stable market, our challenge to our team is to always be looking for the best talent in the markets that we operate in and we have through the pandemic, I think added a number of bankers and senior leaders that we are excited about both in our customer facing businesses and in our, in our staff functions. And so I'd say talent acquisition has been good and we expect it will continue to be. John Pancari : Well, thank you that's helpful. I'm sorry if I could ask just one more on the margin front. Would anything really -- what would change your view about potentially putting some of that excess liquidity to work in the bond portfolio? I know you indicated a lack of interest there, but would it only be a material move in rates beyond what we've seen or is there anything else that would make it put money to work? Thanks. David Turner : Yeah. I think that's the primary. If we could see a steepening effect occur where we have opportunities to -- we\u2019ll take a little bit of risk there. If we continue to see deposit growth continuing to grow where we have even more cash than we have now, could be an opportunity. But again, we really don't want to continue. We've grown our securities both fairly strong compared to our peers, now some have more cash than we do, but we're all trying to figure this out. We're all trying to figure out what type of risk we want to run. And I think for us it's just -- it\u2019s more rate-driven than anything, John. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question is from Dave Rochester of Compass Point. Dave Rochester : Hey, good morning. So you guys have done a great job reducing higher cost borrowings in the last year, I know there isn't much of that left. I was just wondering if you're assuming any further reduction later this year? John Turner : Yeah. So your question is what have we done to reposition -- the liability management and how much further we\u2026 David Turner : We\u2019ve done a good job reducing higher cost borrowers, do we have -- or are false about any other opportunities. John Turner : Yeah. So we're running a little thinner today in terms of opportunities. What we try to do is things that where we don't have liquidity values that we end up taking that out, call it because we have so much cash on hand. We have some marginal opportunities that we're looking at right now Not as many as we have this past year. We have a lot of calls. We\u2019re out FLHB all together, things over $8 billion, we call it. But there\u2019s some small opportunities still left that we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate including things in the preferred stock arena too. Dave Rochester : Okay. And then maybe just one quick bit on the margin. What's the roll on, roll off differential at this point to loan book? And then to the extent that you're buying securities to maybe keep the portfolio stable at this point, I guess where are you guys seeing those yields currently? John Turner : Well, let me talk about it in total. So, we have about $12 billion each year of cash flows. We have to put the work and front both back both piece of that is about $115 million today. It's up a little bit than it had been about 1%, it's about $115 million now. And so, we think we've done a pretty good job through our liability management, cash management strategies to neutralize rate even at the long end. But I think of course we have our hedges on the short end. So, we think we've neutralized rates and our ability to really grow NII I and the resulting margin is really going to be predicated on growing our loan book, the size and mix and then the timing of the PPP program as I mentioned earlier. Operator : Our final question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Hey guys. I just wonder if you could remind us of the strategy in the cap of market business. Obviously it's very strong this quarter but a couple of quarters ago was also very strong. So, remind us target of customer and just how it's integrated with the overall firm. John Turner : Yeah. So we\u2019ve been investing in that business since 2014 and made a couple of acquisitions to help build it, been acquiring talent to help build out our capabilities, and we\u2019re really pleased with the progress. That function was established to really help us leverage capital markets capabilities into our existing customer base and through the creation of some industry verticals, also build a portfolio of new customer opportunities by, again, leveraging capital markets as a mechanism for acquiring new customers. We're doing that both in our commercial and corporate banking business in particular and in our real estate business. One of the very first acquisitions we made was of a Fannie DUS license, and that real estate permanent placement business has been really solid. We had another good quarter in the fourth quarter and expect that we will in the future. So our objective is to combine our capital markets bankers working closely with our industry experts and our local bankers to deliver our capital markets capabilities, whether it be debt placement, the capital-raising activities, M&A derivatives, foreign exchange. All those things are accreting very nicely to us and helping us grow the capital markets business, and our expectation is that we'll continue to see that as the business matures. Matt O'Connor: And I guess the commentary about it being in the $55 million to $65 million range in the near term here, is there just kind of a conservative approach being taken on that, or were there just a couple of lumpy things that really drove the outsized results in the quarter? John Turner : Yeah. The bonus is episodic, it ebbs and flows and what we found is that over the last six years as we\u2019ve been building it, we sort of reach a point of equilibrium where we step up to the next level, so to speak. And so I think maybe a year, to year and a half two years ago we were giving guidance that it was a $40 million to $50 million a quarter kind of business. And now we're increasing that guidance because we think there's more recurring sustainable revenue which will be complemented by the episodic revenue that things that happened that we weren't anticipating, that certainly was the case this quarter when we had a number of M&A transactions that got completed prior to the end of the year pulled forward as a result of customers being eager to get something done in 2020. And so don't anticipate that for the second -- for the first quarter. And we certainly don't plan on that in 2021. So we've guided to sort of a new level of what we would say is more likely consistent performance in that business. Dana Nolan : Okay. Well, if there are no further questions, we very much appreciate your interest and participation today. And have a good weekend. Thank you.

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana and thank you all for joining our call today. We kicked off 2021 on a solid note. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $614 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.63. Our ability to continue to deliver value this quarter is a testament to both the investments we've made, as well as our associates' unwavering commitment to our customers and communities. Our credit metrics continue to improve and reflect the good work we've done with our clients, coupled with the expected benefits from government stimulus. Based on this quarter's credit performance and the improving economic outlook, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by $142 million more than net charge-offs, while still maintaining one of the strongest allowance to loan ratios in the industry at 2.44%. Although we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic, our ongoing conversations with customers reflect optimism about further economic recovery and growth. Vaccine distribution is improving in our footprint and businesses for the most part have reopened. The majority of our largest deposit states are experiencing unemployment rates significantly below those of the US as a whole, and our loan pipelines are improving as we are seeing more activity in the marketplace. We're increasingly optimistic this momentum will continue. Throughout this recovery and beyond, we will maintain our focus on deepening relationships with our customers, while providing personalized financial guidance, combined with excellent technology solutions that continue to make banking easier. Now, David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the prior quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 5% compared to the prior quarter. However, balances remained negatively impacted by excess liquidity in the market, resulting in historically low utilization levels. As of quarter end, commercial line utilization was 39% compared to our historical average of 45%. Just as a reminder, each 1% of line utilization equates to approximately $600 million of loan growth. Commercial loan balances continued to be impacted by the company's ongoing portfolio management activities and PPP forgiveness timing. Average consumer loans again reflected strong mortgage production, offset by runoff portfolios. Overall, we expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low-single digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low-single digits. With respect to deposits, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels led by growth in the consumer segment, reflecting recent government stimulus payments. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances. However, we are also experiencing new account growth. We expect near-term deposit balances will continue to increase, particularly as the recent stimulus is fully disbursed and corporate customers maintain higher cash levels. Let's shift to net interest income and margin which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Net interest income decreased 4% on a reported basis or 1% excluding the impact from day count and PPP. PPP-related NII declined $14 million from the prior quarter, as the benefits from round two were offset by slower round one forgiveness. Two fewer days also reduced NII by $12 million. The decline in core NII stems mostly from lower loan balances and remixing out of higher-yielding loan categories.  Net interest margin declined during the quarter to 3.02%. Cash averaged over $16 billion during the quarter and when combined with PPP reduced first quarter margin by 38 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.40%, evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a near zero short-term rate environment. Similar to prior quarters, the impact from historically low long-term interest rates was offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs, and higher average notional values of active loan hedges. Cash management, mostly in the form of a December long-term debt call contributed $6 million and 1 basis point of margin.  Interest-bearing deposit costs fell two basis points in the quarter to 11 basis points contributing $4 million and 1 basis point of margin. Loan hedges added $102 million to NII and 31 basis points to the margin. Higher average hedge notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the fourth quarter. At current rate levels, we expect a little over $100 million of hedge-related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023. Within the quarter, we repositioned a total of $4.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors targeting less protection in 2023 and 2024. While there may be additional adjustments in the future, we believe the resulting profile allows us to support our goal of consistent, sustainable growth.  Specifically, we are positioned to benefit from the steepening yield curve and increases in short-term interest rates in the future, while protecting NII stability to the extent that Fed is on hold longer than the market currently expects. The potential for loan growth only enhances our participation in a recovering economy. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect NII excluding cash and PPP to be relatively stable. While recent curve steepening has helped asset reinvestment levels, long-term rates will remain a modest near-term headwind. Deposit cost reductions, one additional day and hedging benefits will support NII in the quarter, while loan balances are expected to remain relatively stable. Over the second half of the year and beyond, a strengthening economy, a relatively neutral impact from rates and the potential for balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive growth in NII.  Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 2% from the prior quarter but reflects a 32% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. Capital markets delivered another strong quarter as customers continued to respond to interest rate changes and potential regulatory and tax headwinds.  Fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and securities underwriting both achieved record levels, and M&A advisory services also delivered solid results. While we expect capital markets revenue to remain solid over the remainder of the year, some activity was pulled forward.  Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. Mortgage delivered another strong quarter as we continue to focus on growing market share and improving our customer experience. Mortgage income increased 20% over the prior quarter, driven primarily by agency gain on sale and favorable MSR valuation. Production for the quarter was up 89% over the prior year, setting the stage for another strong year of mortgage income. Service charges were negatively impacted by both seasonal declines and increased deposit balances. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. Although, we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels. Card and ATM fees have recovered up 10% compared to the prior year driven primarily by increased debit card spend. Given the timing of interest rate changes in 2020 combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP, loan forgiveness and loan growth. Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses decreased 1% in the quarter driven by lower incentive compensation primarily related to capital markets and mortgage, which was partially offset by a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Of note, base salaries were 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process. Associate head count decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 4% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of our Ascentium Capital acquisition that closed April 1, 2020 head count was down 6%. We will continue to prudently manage expenses, while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. In 2021, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to remain stable compared to 2020 with quarterly adjusted non-interest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range. And while we face uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. From an asset quality perspective, overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Annualized net charge-offs were 40 basis points a three basis point improvement over the prior quarter reflecting broad-based improvement across most portfolios. Non-performing loans, total delinquencies, business services criticized loans all declined modestly. Our allowance for credit losses declined 25 basis points to 2.44% of total loans and 280% of total non-accrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.57%. The decline in the allowance reflects charge-offs previously provided for, stabilization in our economic outlook and improved credit performance including the impact of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill approved in March. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $142 million benefit to the provision. Our allowance remains one of the highest in our peer group as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. As we look forward, we are cautiously optimistic regarding our credit performance for the year. While net charge-offs can be volatile quarter-to-quarter based on current expectations we believe the peak is behind us and we expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 40 basis points to 50 basis points. With respect to capital our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 10.3% this quarter. As you are aware, the Federal Reserve extended their restrictions on capital distributions through the second quarter of 2021. The Federal Reserve also indicated these restrictions are expected to be lifted beginning in the third quarter subject to capital remaining above required levels in the ongoing 2021 CCAR cycle for firms participating. We have opted into this year's CCAR and assuming capital levels remain above required levels in the Fed stress test, we should be back to managing capital distributions against the SCB requirements beginning in the third quarter. However, our plan is to begin share repurchases in the second quarter subject to the Fed's earnings-based restrictions. Based on our internal stress testing framework and the amount of capital we need to run our business, we are updating our operating range for common equity Tier 1 to 9.25% to 9.75% with a goal of managing to the midpoint over time. So wrapping up on the next slide our 2021 expectations, which we have already addressed. In summary, we feel really good about our first quarter results and anticipate carrying the momentum into the remainder of 2021. Pre-tax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid and we are optimistic about the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. John Turner : Good morning Ken. Ken Usdin : Sorry guys, is that open to me Ken Usdin? John Turner : Yes. Ken Usdin : Oh my bad. Sorry. I thought I lost you for a second. Thank you. Yes David, just wondering you made the points clearly about starting to reposition that longer-term swaps portfolio and to position for potentially higher rates. How are you -- how do you help us think about how that changes that longer-term trajectory of recognized income versus just the hopes that rates go the right way and loans are better than presuming the economic recovery? And in terms of just how you make future decisions on future -- on other potential terminations? Thank you. David Turner : Yes. So Ken, we never anticipated for all the derivatives to go to term. We wanted protection and our goal is not to turn the derivatives into a trading asset, but to have it help us manage the volatility of NII and this worked extremely well for us. As we think about the future, we obviously look at all the data points to try and figure out when the Fed may move. And as we continue to have economic progress we're thinking that there is more likelihood of an increase in short rates and probably long rates to follow starting in the back half of 2022 into 2023 and 2024. We wanted to participate in that and not have our NII being muted, so we terminated the $4.3 billion worth of derivatives. You take the whatever gain you have, and you have to spread that over the life you don't get a one-time gain. So, we will continue to evaluate the economic recovery and we'll make adjustments as we go along. We still have protection though for 2021 and 2022, no change there. It's just the -- out the curve I mean out the term a little bit in terms of 2020 -- really 2023 and 2024. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. And then along the way, obviously, you're still sitting on this big excess cash position as you show it to us in your core NIM. Can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about staging incremental use of that cash versus the hopes for loan growth that you and the rest of the industry are hoping for anticipating? David Turner : Yes. We -- like many folks, we had nice deposit growth. We've had $16 billion average cash at the Fed, $23 billion at the end of the quarter. We constantly challenge ourselves Ken on whether or not to put that work in the securities book when -- of course, we want to make all the good quality loans we can. That's been elusive for the industry thus far. And so, some have deployed that in the securities book. We've done a little bit, but we're reluctant because as I was talking to our Treasurer yesterday, there's no free lunch here. You just can't -- you can't hide from the risk that you take if you try to take duration risk right now and deploying that. The securities book will help you short term in NII, but you will pay for that nearly down the road and we're playing the long game. We're not about trying to generate short-term NII growth for that sake. So that being said, we are challenging ourselves and as we make different decisions to get that deployed, you should not expect wholesale investment in the securities book, but you may see some around the hedges. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks for that David. Operator : Your next question is from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. John Turner : Good morning Ryan. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. So maybe to dig in a little bit on revenues. You're off to a nice start to the year, I think, revenues are up over 9% year-over-year with both NII and fees up. So can you just maybe talk through the revenue outlook a bit? And where could there be sources of upside just given the fact that the guide implies a pretty strong deceleration from the first quarter and it looks like mortgage and capital markets could remain strong? And then second it just seems like PPP is one of the potential swing factors. Can you maybe just help us understand what are you assuming for balances and forgiveness for the rest of the year? And then I have a follow-up. David Turner : Okay. So to start with the top of the house. So our guide on total adjusted revenues is down modestly. Obviously, continue to have pressure and reinvestment of fixed rate assets throughout the year. We do have some obviously protection on NII through our hedging program. So we're excited about that. From a loan growth standpoint, we are in some great markets and we expect to benefit over time, as our economies continue to open and we get some loan growth. We have some headwinds in terms of can we continue to have capital markets at $100 million every quarter. We guided you to $55 million to $65 million. So who knows I mean, if we continue to have capital markets should be robust, M&A should be robust and we might be able to outperform there. But we gave you the guide of $55 million to $65 million. We think mortgage will continue to be strong. Our teams are performing very well in terms of mortgage. And we think there could be some upside there. But who knows we have to see what happens with the rate environment. I think in terms of PPP we have $4.3 billion of PPP loans outstanding. We originated $1.5 billion under the PPP 2 program and we forgave about $700 million in the first quarter. The timing of that forgiveness is a big determinant Ryan in terms of ultimate income for us. We think that's back-end loaded literally in the fourth quarter before you start seeing real forgiveness. As a matter of fact, we have a little bit of pressure on PPP-generated revenue in from first to second quarter as we disclosed a little bit -- and that's only because of timing. The point is, if you got $4.3 billion the fees and interest we earn off that's a little over 3% it's just timing. When is it coming in and your guess is as good as ours on that. But that will be -- that's a pretty big swing factor in terms of where we end up on our guide on revenue for the year. Ryan Nash : Got it. Okay. And then in terms of capital, you just announced the 9.25% to 9.75%. You put out a release the other day announcing a $2.5 billion buyback. And if I look at market expectations for earnings, it implies a pretty steep decline in the capital level. So can you maybe just talk about expectations for utilizing the buyback assuming the Fed continues to ease restrictions? And where do you see you actually running with the capital? I heard you said to run in the middle, but given that we're entering a period of strong economic growth potential for rates rising at some point in time could we move towards the lower end of that over time? Thanks. David Turner : Well so we had -- our last goal was closer to 10%. We changed our operating range to 9.25% to 9.75% and said we'd operate in the middle over time. That range can change, as economic conditions continue to improve. And we still have uncertainty out there. So we believe that's an appropriate range and appropriate midpoint of that at 9.50% is the right place for Regions at this time. As conditions get better we'll -- we can adjust accordingly. Or if they get worse, we'll adjust the other way. We are at 10.3% today. So that's 80 basis points from the middle. Round numbers that's $800 million worth of capital. We'll continue to -- we didn't have buybacks in the first quarter. As I mentioned, we will have some in the second quarter. But let's go back and remember our capital we want to use to grow our business. That's its priority. We'd love to have more loan growth out there and to use it that way. We're going to pay a dividend in the 35% to 45% of our income so that we have a sustainable dividend. We like to use that capital for non-bank acquisitions like we did on Ascentium Capital as a good example. So that's our preference. We will then -- the last effort we will use buybacks to maintain and optimize our capital at that 9.5% common equity Tier 1. So we'll be restricted on how much we get to do in the second quarter. We think we'll have a very good CCAR submission which gives us more flexibility to manage that -- to that 9.5% starting in the third quarter. And you should expect us to get there fairly quickly. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. David Turner : Good morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, John, and good morning David. John Turner : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : David, can you touch on -- you gave us some good color on, the loan loss reserves. And I know we've talked about this in the past, about your day one reserves back in January of 2020. What's the likelihood that you guys could get to that level, or maybe even something less if the economy is even better going forward let's say, 18 months from now, than it was back on January 1, 2020. And the mix of business is less risky than possibly it was back then as well? David Turner : Well, you kind of answered your own question there, I think Gerard. And that is you're exactly right. We're sitting here today at 2.44% coverage or 2.57% if you exclude PPP. Our day one was 1.71%. And that's more again to the 2.44% by the way. And so, the question is, when can you get back to there? And I would just say? We really don't think of it as back to there. We think of with the appropriate reserve we need to have, based on the risk inherent in our portfolio, that can change based on your profile. And to the extent the profile is better, than it was that January when we adopted, if the environment that we expect through the whole life of the loan is better than the reserves can go below that. But it's all dependent on what the facts and circumstances are at each balance sheet day. And so, we see the economy getting better. As we've mentioned, it's better faster than we thought. We're still cautiously optimistic about where this goes. We need to get the vaccine out. We need the economies to continue to open. And if all that happens you would expect reserves to come down. But right now, we can only take it -- we can only adjust the reserves based on what we see today. If next quarter it's better, then you would expect it to come down. So there's no magic in that day one. That day one was based on the facts and circumstances that existed in January. And if they're better, then you would expect reserves to be lower. If it's worse, you would expect them to be higher. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. You gave us some good color on, the hedging program in both your prepared remarks and answering an earlier question. On the $100 million that you're generating currently at the present time, how could that number -- or what interest rate environment would you need to see, to see that $100 million maybe get to $120 million or vice versa fall to $80 million? Can you give us some color about that particular amount? And how it's impacted by rates? David Turner : Well, clearly the -- so we're receiving fixed swaps and we have floors. So you earn more to the extent rates are lower, than where we are today. And that's pegged off of LIBOR. So LIBOR, it's pretty down going low. So you would have to see that go to almost zero. We don't have any new derivatives, where we began the notional. We had some in this first quarter a little bit. I think really as you think about... [Technical Difficulty] John Turner : Go ahead. David Turner : Hello. Are we still there? Gerard Cassidy : You're fine. We hear you. David Turner : I'm sorry. Okay. So I think, you should think about the contribution really as a stabilizing factor in terms of NII. It wasn't meant to help us increase NII it was to keep us protected in case we had an extraordinarily low-rate environment like we do. So being able to have $100 million to $103 million, $105 million each quarter is really what it's about not trying to get it, to be $120 million and $130 million. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. David Turner : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the expense outlook. So we've been getting questions from investors recently. Some of your peers this week had announced higher expectations for expense growth due to accelerated investments. And as I look at slide seven in that very consistent 1% CAGR, John, I'm wondering if you can assure investors on, how you've been able to keep expense growth at these low levels and invest back in the company? In other words, is there going to be a potential surprise with regards to expense growth, going forward especially as we look forward to a stronger revenue growth environment? John Turner : No, no surprises Erika. We as you know announced an initiative now a couple of years ago, we characterized to simplify and grow. We talk now about it as being about continuous improvement. It was largely designed as a way to focus on how we simplify our business, how we flatten the organizational structure reduce expenses to make investments, in people, in technology, and additional capabilities, and products. And I think we've successfully done that. To your point, we've been able to keep expenses generally flat, while providing increased compensation every year for the teams that remain with us, investing significantly in our business, hiring additional bankers and other associates who are working actively in our technology function and risk management and other parts of our business. And we'll continue to do that. David mentioned this morning, we're committed to holding expenses essentially flat. There maybe some increases from time to time, if revenue rises, and that revenue is associated with variable compensation like capital markets, like mortgage. But otherwise, our core run rate of expenses should be flat. And we believe that, we can continue to make investments in our business, while holding those expenses flat. David Turner : Yeah, Erika, that $880 million to $890 million number that we have guided to and \u2013 we have embedded in that the investments we want to make as John mentioned. Erika Najarian : Perfect. Thank you. And David the second question is for you. I'm guessing that, you opted into the 2021 CCAR to optimize your stress capital buffer lower. What can you do to be able to better direct the results closer to 2.5%? David Turner : Yeah. So if you were to look at the resubmission that we had in December, you would have seen our degradation there would have put us underneath the floor of 2.5%. We ran our model based on the assumptions, the CCAR assumptions in the first quarter. We believe the results will again show that, we will be underneath the floor of 2.5%. So part of the reason, we wanted to participate is because of that. The other part of it is, our credit has continued to improve pretty dramatically, even relative to our peers. And this gives us an opportunity to show you and the rest of the world that that our credit has continued to improve as a result of our de-risking strategy, our capital allocation strategy. We feel very good about that. This gives an opportunity for an independent third-party in this case the Federal Reserve, to show everybody what our losses are relative to peers. So we're excited about participating. We think it will show well. We feel very good about our credit as we've mentioned in the call, and we have robust reserves and capital levels on top of that. So we're well positioned, and I think this can help us from a credit rating agency as well. Erika Najarian : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. John Turner : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Just a clarification on your expenses. For the full year, obviously, it implies a drop-down for the rest of the year. Is that just lower incentive comp related to capital markets and mortgage revenues, or are there any other drivers as we think about the drop-down from 1Q? David Turner : Yeah Matt, it's that, but it's also as John mentioned, our continuous improvement program. It's just \u2013 we're focused on this every day. And so we continue to make adjustments in leveraging technology and processes. And I talked about head count and that's part of how the head count is down as we're leveraging technology. So we just have an intense focus on, one, making appropriate investments to grow our business that's number one. We have to figure out how to pay for that, so we can keep our expenses relatively flat. So every part of the organization is focused on expense control, so that we can make that investment. And I think you're going to see our expenses as I mentioned should come down to the $880 million $890 million for the remainder of the year. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately as we think about loan growth picking up, exiting the year obviously, there's the PPP running off and the exit portfolios. But, what do you think will be the drivers of growth for you guys exiting this year into next year? John Turner : Yeah. Matt, this is John. Our customers are increasingly optimistic about the economy. We operate in some -- as David said, some really good markets. And most of the states that we operate in were some of the first to reopen their economies. As a result, unemployment rates in states like Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, are better than national average. And so, we see businesses expanding. Our pipelines today are 50% larger than they were this time last year. And that is broad-based across geography and sectors. And we expect to see growth as companies work through the excess liquidity they're holding, beginning to rebuild inventories, make investments in property plant and equipment as their businesses expand. So, I think there is opportunity to grow. The question will be the timing of that. And as David mentioned, we are experiencing historically low levels of line utilization. We expect our customers will get back into their lines of credit. Once they work through the excess liquidity that they're holding, just don't know what the timing of that will be, it's largely a function of obviously economic growth. We're confident that as the economy expands we will grow loans. Separately, I think we'll continue to see good mortgage production on the consumer side, and we've got some other initiatives underway related to consumer lending that we think could have an impact as well. And finally, with small business, we're very pleased with our acquisition of Ascentium Capital. We think that equipment finance is an important part of potential growth, particularly in late 2021 and 2022. And so, I believe all those things can be drivers of some loan growth to offset to your point the headwinds we face with PPP and some of the exit portfolios. Matt O'Connor: That was a good stat. The pipeline is up 50% year-over-year. Obviously, COVID was starting to be a drag in the comp a year ago. Do you happen to have that before COVID? John Turner : Yes. It's pretty close to. So the range kind of, if I think back 14 months or so, pipelines would be reasonably comparable, not quite back to late 2019, but pretty near there. Matt O'Connor: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Turner : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Back to the capital discussion, I know you indicated in terms of capital deployment, potential M&A interest on the non-bank side. I wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit on what areas on the non-bank side you would consider deals? And then, separately, if you could just talk about potential interest in whole bank deals, clearly you've seen a fair amount of activity in the Southeast and a lot of banks moving towards bulking up on scale. So, just want to get your updated thoughts there. Thanks. John Turner : Yes. Okay. Well, with respect to non-bank, we've been active over the last several years acquiring capabilities in capital markets, low-income housing tax credits capabilities equipment finance obviously with Ascentium Capital and wealth management, Highland Associates or Highland Capital in the mortgage business, mortgage servicing rights. All those things reflect the kinds of interest that we still have. So, to the extent, we can acquire portfolios, acquire capabilities that we think will allow us to provide additional services to customers to grow and diversify our revenue, we're active and interested and will continue to be. With respect to bank M&A, our view still hasn't changed. We think we have a very solid plan. We want to continue to execute that plan. We believe if we do that we can deliver real value for our shareholders. We'll see the benefits in our stock price and the strengthening currency. And so, we're watching the activity that's occurring. We're evaluating it, trying to learn from it. But, our focus is on executing our plans in the markets that we operate in, and we think there's a lot of value creation associated with that for our shareholders. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks, John. And then, my second question is around operating efficiency. I know you indicated that your goal is to continue to produce positive operating leverage over time. Your adjusted operating efficiency ratio came in around 56.8% this quarter. Where do you see that going for the full year 2021 and maybe beyond that? Interested in what your thoughts are for 2022. Where is a fair level where that could reach? And what's a good run rate? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So you're right we're going to stay focused on generating positive operating leverage overtime. We do that by both growing the revenue and -- because of the investments that we're making and watching our costs. We feel good about where we are with our efficiency ratio especially compared to our peer group. Obviously, that gets more challenging as the year goes as a low interest rate environment and the reinvestment risk puts more pressure on revenue. You asked about 2022. I haven't gotten to 2022 yet, but if you think about the industry I think we've got all work towards getting underneath that 55% in time and lower. But you can't do that until you get kind of normalized environment where you have normalized revenue. And if you did that being under 55% is going to be I think expected. So in the interim, you get as efficient as you can, but you still have to make the investments to grow revenue and that's what we're doing. So we've got a number of initiatives on our continuous improvement program that will continue to help us from the cost standpoint. And hopefully those continuous improvement efforts also help us grow revenue. So I know I didn't give you a specific point John, but at the end of the day we'll continue to work to get that number down overtime. John Pancari : No. Thanks, David. Helpful. Operator : Your next question is from David Rochester of Compass Point. John Turner : Good morning. David Rochester : Hi. Good morning, guys. On the liquidity discussion earlier can you just talk about where your purchase yields are today in securities? And then what you need to see on the rate front to get you feeling more comfortable with shifting more of that excess cash into the securities book overtime? And it sounds like you don't have much of that at all in your NII or revenue guide at this point. Is that right? David Turner : That's right. We've said around the edges we may deploy some of our excess cash. If you go into general mortgage bags today you may pick up 130 basis points. We're still having pressure on the front book, back book of about 40 basis points between loans and securities. So that's what weighs on us. We really need to see that 10-year getting to two-plus two and kind of stay there and feel convicted on that before we take the duration risk because we just don't want to \u2013 again, we don't want to make a short-term play for NII and feel bad about that six months from now because rates got away from us. And, I think, we're all seeing the economy improve. The pace of that we can debate. And with that should come a higher rate environment overtime. So in the interim, we're just going to be cautious. We may pick like I said a little bit of our excess cash and put it to work, but you should not expect wholesale changes through an investment in the securities book at this time. David Rochester : Yes. Okay. Great. Appreciate the color there. And then if for whatever reason you don't end up seeing the loan growth pan out as you expect in 2Q and maybe even into the back half of the year and the cash continues to build. Can you just talk about how that situation might impact that investment strategy if at all? And then what other steps you could take to offset some of that lost revenue? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. We continue as John mentioned looking for portfolios and things to really put not only our capital to work but to put our liquidity to work to -- to the extent that deposits continue to come in at the pace they are. One it'd be surprising because the growth that we saw primarily this quarter in consumer came from the $1.9 trillion stimulus program that we got in the quarter. So I don't think we'll continue to see it grow at that pace. But to the extent that it does and we end up -- our $23 billion at the Fed grows materially from that then we may make different decisions. But I don't think that's a very high probability. We'd much rather again find loan growth by portfolios and put a little bit it to work in the securities book. David Rochester : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. John Turner : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the deposit growth. What I thought was interesting was all the growth came from consumer and the commercial side was down a little. Do you think that could be an indicator that maybe in the second quarter you start to see commercial deposits coming down and maybe you get that line draw that you're looking for in the second half of the year as the indicator? David Turner : Peter, I think, in the second quarter to see that all of a sudden happen, I don't know. We've talked to our customers one-on-one. We believe over time that they're going to probably maintain more liquidity today than they did pre-pandemic. We'll see, when we get there, but that's what we're hearing. I think the consumer growth you saw, again, it was based on the stimulus that hit during the quarter. So, I don't expect it to have that kind of growth every quarter. Although, we're growing customer accounts too and we're very pleased about new customer acquisition. On the business front, in terms of second quarter growth though I think, it's more pushed to the second half of the year as these balances get worked through their liquidity gets worked through. And as John mentioned, we're in very good markets. We're excited about the growth potential here. So it's just a matter of time, before we see the loan growth. I just don't think you're going to get that breakthrough in the second quarter. Peter Winter : Okay. And then just on premium amortization expense, it was stable quarter-to-quarter at $50 million. If the 10-year were to increase closer to that 2% level, where does premium amortization expense go down to? David Turner : Yes. I think, if we were to be that high, we're probably down $5 million, maybe $10-ish million somewhere there -- in there. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Jennifer Demba of Truist Securities. David Turner : Good morning, Jennifer Jennifer Demba : Let's go back to everyone's favorite question on M&A. What would compel you to change your stance on the whole bank M&A? Would it be that, you can't get below that 55% efficiency ratio over the medium or long term, or is there something else that you think could compel you to change your attitude there? John Turner : Yes. I think, if our view out over the next three years, that's our strategic planning horizon was that, we couldn't continue to deliver improving returns for our shareholders that we weren't going to perform relative to our peers well then, I think we would have to consider a variety of alternatives. But today, we think we see a path to continue to grow revenue. We believe we can continue to make meaningful investments in our business, while holding our expenses relatively flat. And we think all that is a path to generating nice returns for our shareholders. And so, our perspective is unchanged. But to your question, it's possible and that's why we continue to follow the market, trying to understand what others are doing and how transactions get structured. So we're not totally -- we're not -- it's not as if we're not paying attention I guess would be my point. Jennifer Demba : Okay. Second question is on credit. Just can you give us some color on how your more COVID-sensitive borrowers are doing now [Indiscernible] and how they should fare with stimulus [Indiscernible]? John Turner : Again in the markets that we operate in those economies are open and people are beginning to move around. There's a lot of pent-up demand. And as a result, we see hospitality sector whether it be restaurants or hotels continuing to -- their performance continuing to improve. Probably the biggest challenge they face is workforce and hiring people to work. Heard a number of stories sort of anecdotally over the last two-plus weeks about restaurant service being slow in so many places because, restaurant owners are having difficulty bringing their workforce back. But people are getting out. And there's I think a significant indicators that people are going to be traveling a lot this summer. And so, again, thinking about the markets we operate in that bodes well for those economies. The energy sector is doing better for sure. So all in all, credit continues to improve. And based upon what we know today, we'd expect that trajectory to continue. Jennifer Demba : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, John and David. Can you give us an update on how Regions is thinking about the use of its balance sheet in conjunction with partnerships with financial technology players? How important is it for Regions to own the customer relationship versus what's your willingness to give certain parameters for the kinds of loans that you're interested in originating to financial technology partners and letting them originate those loans for you? John Turner : Yes. Very important to us to own the relationship and we have experimented with partnerships. And what -- in every case, what we were seeking to determine was could we leverage that partnership back into a relationship. And where you see us beginning to exit those partnerships, it is because we ultimately concluded that they weren't relationship-building opportunities.  We are looking consistently to expand our capabilities to think about how we potentially acquire platforms that we would own that would allow us to originate credit as an example to companies or individuals who ultimately could become -- would become customers and Ascentium Capital is a great example of that. That company had some really good technology, a platform to originate credit made it easy for customers.  We liked it. We saw it as an opportunity to acquire the technology and the capabilities that very experienced team had to help us grow into the small business space to -- with companies that could potentially become Regions' depository customers, Regions' wealth management customers. And so that's I think the way you'll see us continue to use our balance sheet is to build relationships. Q \u2013 Bill Carcache : Understood. Separately your rationale behind wanting to get your stress capital buffer below 2.5% makes sense simply because of what it signals in terms of credit quality relative to your peers. But can you discuss from a practical perspective, what the significance is given your intention is to run with around 9.5% CET1?  So having the 2.5% stress capital buffer on top of your 4.5% minimum would set your minimum capital level at 7%. But since your intention is to run with around 9.5% anyway, is it really that big of a deal to have a little bit higher SCB? Maybe you're looking longer-term to a goal of lowering your CET1 target over time? Just if you could speak to that would be helpful. David Turner : You get the prize of the question of the day and you're exactly right. Today's environment, the SCB for us really doesn't come into play because there's no way in the world we would have our spot capital below 7%. And I think as an investor, most investors would have a conniption fit if we did that. So that was just a piece of it because -- but it sends a message when your peers are all under the floor of 2.5% and you're at 3%, it kind of sends this message its credit quality is worse. We don't believe that. And we wanted a very public opportunity to demonstrate that. And that's really what this was all about.  So I wouldn't say that gives us an opportunity to run our capital lower. We think our 9.5% in the middle of our range is the right number for us at this time based on the risk we see in our business. If over time risk changes, the outlook changes, we might operate lower than that. But from a practical standpoint, we're not going to get anywhere close to the 7% spot. And so you're exactly right. It wasn't done just for that purpose. John Turner : The only other thing I'd add is, every time we participate, we learn something. And I think it helps us continue to develop our thinking about how we manage the risk in our business, the composition of our business, the impact of various stress scenarios on our portfolios. All those things are constructive. And in addition to David's point, I think it's -- we have an opportunity to sort of reset and we want to do that. We believe that's appropriate. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful John and David. Thank you for taking my questions. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. John Turner : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Hi. Good morning. Just a little follow-up on that. I'm still trying to understand the Board approval, which I assume you requested the size of the buyback that you requested, because when I run that through the model I'm getting to an ultimate CET1 that's below the range that you indicated today. So is that Board request a function of the max potential that you might anticipate in an environment where the loan book is not growing, or -- I'm just trying to square that the Board request versus the CET1 guide versus the loan growth outlook. David Turner : Yes. So the main driver right now would be the CET1 guide. The $2.5 billion that we that our Board authorized grants us the flexibility to manage our capital, as we see fit without having to go back to the Board for another authorization. So it's going to be a function of how much we make, what's the environment look like, what's our capital levels look like. There are a whole host of things that go into that and that was a level that we felt comfortable that we could run with. And it gives us flexibility to manage accordingly. That's all it's about. Betsy Graseck : And what's the expiry date on that? Is that authorization? David Turner : Yes. It's an open authorization. There's not a date. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Yes. So it's longer tailed. Okay. And then the second question just has to do with ESG. And the reason I'm asking is that recently we've seen several institutions put out there 2021 plans and goals. And we all know what's going on with regard to carbon footprint emission goals that the global industry has or politicians, et cetera. So the question here has to do with how you're thinking about your climate goals as it relates to your work with your customers? You're in an energy-intensive footprint. And I know for yourself you've been very clear on your climate-oriented goals and how far along you are for yourself. But I'm wondering how do you think about working with your customers on this? Is this something you would be embracing, or give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that. Thanks. John Turner : Yes. I think about it from a couple of different perspectives. One is just managing the credit risk that's in our book today and the potential impact of climate change and transition on the industries that we bank. We're talking to our customers. We're very aware of potential impacts. We understand the exposure we have within our portfolio. And so we're actively managing that. We believe that it's important that the banking industry be part of the transition and participate in financing the transition that will occur to a more climate-friendly environment. And so we want to be actively participating. We have a very good, as an example, solar capabilities and capital markets capabilities associated with solar, and we are continuing to look for opportunities to develop capabilities that would support the transition to a more climate-friendly environment. And so we think that's a business opportunity. Beyond that we have real governance, good governance around and we spent the last two days in board meetings talking about ESG and our overall ESG plan. We will file our TCFD report mid-summer so that -- to be in compliance. And I think you'll find our disclosures around ESG to be very broad and on point. So\u2026 David Turner : So Betsy, I'll add to that that -- so we started with our own emissions kind of in scope 1 and then we went into the vendors that we used and how are they thinking about ESG going into customers and how they do that. So this is an ongoing process and we'll stay committed to getting that done over time. I do want to clarify the -- I misspoke on the share repurchase. That runs through next year, through the first quarter of next year. So it is not open. It's basically a year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Yeah. That's why I was a little bit like confused around the messaging you were trying to send with regard to the size of the buyback versus the CET1 range. And I guess your messaging is \"Hey we wanted max flexibility.\" David Turner : That's correct. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to circle on the difference between your new loan yields and what was on balance sheet this quarter? David Turner : Yeah. Our total on our front book, back book is -- between securities and loans is about 40 basis points. From a loan standpoint, I think that component is pretty close. It's maybe 10, 15 basis points, a little more on the securities book. Christopher Marinac : David, as you look at this type of environment, what causes that to narrow or change in the future? Is it something that's possible, or it will take a while? David Turner : No, it can change. Your mix has a lot to do with it in terms of what you're footing on versus what's rolling off. We have different portfolios we've invested in. We see growth in our small business through our newly acquired Ascentium Capital. Those have a tendency to have higher yields that could be helpful. But we are seeing some of our customers access the capital markets and that puts a little pressure on loan growth. And when those clients leave, it's tough to get that replaced at the yield that we had them on. So as the economy opens, we think we see more activity and we think the rate environment will improve a bit commensurate with that increased economic activity. Christopher Marinac : Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much for all your comments. David Turner : Thank you. John Turner : Thank you. John Turner : Okay. Well that concludes I think all the question and answer. So thank you very much. I appreciate your participation today and your interest in Regions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions' second quarter 2021 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana and thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and importantly, we're beginning to see increased activity across our footprint. It gives us greater confidence for overall growth in the second half of the year. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $748 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.77. Credit quality at Regions and across the industry has demonstrated remarkable resiliency throughout the pandemic. Broadly speaking, since the pandemic began, I believe, banks have done a tremendous job, staying close to customers and supporting their needs by providing capital advice and guidance. As that begun to trap our footprint again and meet with customers, I see them gaining confidence in the economic recovery and their own business plans. I was seeing the strength of our markets first hand. This combined with the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plan has positioned Regions well for growth as the economic recovery continues. We remain focused on client selectivity, risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation, all while making investments particularly in talent and technology to support growth. For example, over the last year, we redesigned our mobile app and are continuing to make further enhancements to both our online and mobile platforms. We digitized the sales process. You can now apply for almost any consumer banking product online. We're putting digital tools in the hands of our bankers and contact center associates allowing customers to start a process in one channel and seamlessly transition to another. We now have e-signature capabilities across most of the franchise. As a result of all of these changes, year-to-date, digital sales are up 53% over the prior year. We have also leveraged artificial intelligence to build lead generation and next best action tools for our bankers. We're also utilizing Artificial Intelligence in our contact centers. Reggie, our virtual banker is on pace to handle over 1 million customer calls this year. Technology investments have also allowed nearly 100% of our contact center associates to work remotely providing permanent cost savings from reductions in legacy corporate space. In addition, over the last three years, we've increased mortgage loan originators by approximately 150 and we continue to add talent as we grow market share. We've also added approximately 80 client-facing associates across the corporate bank and wealth management with a particular focus on growth markets. We've consolidated over 215 branches while opening 75 De Novo branches, primarily within dense fast growing markets. These new branches have contributed almost 20% of our total retail checking account growth over the last three years. We're also investing in products and capabilities to serve our customers. In wealth management, we deepened our expertise in the not-for-profit and healthcare space, through the acquisition of Highland Associates, and we're working on a digital advisory solution with deployment targeted for late this year or early next. Last year, we purchased Ascentium Capital to help small businesses with their essential equipment needs and the platform has performed well throughout the pandemic. On the consumer side, we just announced an agreement to acquire EnerBank, a top 5 originator in the home improvement point-of-sale space, which we're really excited about. Going forward, we'll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions that provide products and capabilities that are important to our customers. Win some really great markets as reflected on this slide, you see now. These markets, coupled with our go-to-market strategy and aided by technology investments have helped us realize some really nice growth in consumer checking accounts. Our year-to-date account growth is nearly 3 times higher than our 2019 pre-pandemic rate for the same period. So we have a really solid strategic plan that supports our goal of generating consistent, sustainable long-term performance and we have a proven track record of successful execution. We feel very good about our progress and believe, we are really well positioned to grow as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum in our markets. Now, David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average adjusted loans remained stable during the quarter, although adjusted ending loans increased 1%, confirming our view that loan growth should begin in the back half of the year. Although corporate loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, production remained strong with new and renewed commitments increasing 33% compared to first quarter and we believe utilization rates reached an inflection point during the quarter. On a reported basis, average corporate loans increased while ending loans declined reflecting an acceleration in PPP forgiveness late in the quarter. Through June 30, approximately 53% of total PPP loans have been forgiven and we anticipate that reaching approximately 80% by year end. Consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest ending growth in credit card. However consumer loans continue to be negatively impacted by run-off portfolios and further pay downs in home equity. Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits. With respect to loan guidance and the rest of our 2021 expectations, we are not including any impacts from our pending EnerBank acquisition. So, let's turn to deposits. Although, the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continue to increase this quarter to new record levels. The increase was primarily due to higher account balances. However, as John mentioned, we're also producing strong new account growth. We are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior and based on analysis of pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics, we currently believe between 20% and 30% of deposit increases will likely persist on the balance sheet. Broadly speaking, we think liquidity will normalize over time as the Fed becomes less accommodative. Reductions in their asset purchases will mitigate future liquidity increases in the system, which should curve further deposit growth. Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Pandemic-related items continue to impact NII and margin. PPP related NII increased $3 million from the prior quarter. Cash averaged $23 billion during the quarter, and when combined with PPP, reduce second quarter reported margin by 50 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our adjusted margin was 3.31%, evidencing active balance sheet management efforts despite a near zero short-term rate environment. The 9 basis point linked quarter decline was mostly attributable to the purchase of $2 billion of securities and one additional day in the quarter, both of which support NII at the expense of margin. Similar to prior quarters, the impact on NII from historically low long-term interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher hedging income. Lower LIBOR drove a $2 million increase from loan hedges, and at current rate levels, we expect roughly $105 million of hedge -related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023. Since the beginning of 2021, we have repositioned a total of $6.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors. We do not currently expect any further repositioning, however, this is continually evaluated in the context of a dynamic balance sheet.  Our current balance sheet profile allows us to support our goal of consistent sustainable earnings growth. Specifically, we are positioned to benefit from higher middle tenor [ph] interest rates and increases in short-term interest rates in the future, while protecting NII stability to the extent the Fed remains on hold longer than the market currently expects. Importantly, recent declines of longer maturity market yields have less of an impact on Regions' earnings potential as most of our fixed rate production has maturities of shorter than six years, a point on the curve that on a relative basis has fallen less. With respect to outlook, we view second quarter's NII to be the low point for the year. Over the second half and beyond, a strengthening economy, a relatively neutral impact from rates and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive NII growth.  Before moving on, I want to highlight slide 17 through 19 in the appendix which provides additional asset liability management information that we think will be helpful to investors. Now, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 6% from the prior quarter, but reflects a 5% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. Capital markets return to a normal run rate after experiencing record results in the prior two quarters. Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to remain a strong contributor, generating quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. Mortgage income decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily due to the gain on sale compression and hedge performance, particularly around timing and market volatility.  We believe pricing has stabilized and expect second half revenue to be fairly consistent with that recorded during the second quarter. Wealth management income increased quarter-over-quarter reflecting strong production and favorable market conditions. Service charges also increased compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by three additional business days. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting which we have highlighted in the appendix are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. We estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020 but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels.  Card and ATM fees continue to benefit from increased economic activity in our footprint, reflecting strong growth, up 11% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased debit and credit card spend, both now exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020 combined with exceptionally strong non-interest income we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be stable to up modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness.  Let's move on to non-interest expense. While exceptionally strong performance, particularly in credit is contributing to higher than anticipated other incentive compensation, adjusted non-interest expenses decreased 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets incentive compensation, payroll taxes and legal and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in merit and marketing expenses. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. In 2021, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to be stable to up modestly compared to 2020 with quarterly adjusted non-interest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range. And we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. From an asset quality standpoint, we delivered strong performance as overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Reflecting broad-based improvement across most portfolios and recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values, annualized net charge-offs decreased 17 basis points during the quarter to 23 basis points. Non-performing loans, total delinquencies and business services criticized loans all improved during the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses declined 44 basis points to 2% of total loans and 253% of total non-accrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.07%. The decline in the allowance reflects better than expected credit trends and a continued constructive outlook on the economy. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $337 million benefit to the provision. Our allowance remains above peer median as measured against period end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. Based on improved market conditions, we now expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 25 basis points to 35 basis points. With respect to capital, our common equity tier 1 ratio increased approximately 10 basis points to an estimated 10.4% this quarter. Based on the recent stress test results, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement for the fourth quarter 2021 through the third quarter of 2022 will be 2.5%. And our common equity tier 1 operating range remains 9.25% to 9.75% with the goal of managing to the midpoint over time. We repurchased 8 million common shares during the second quarter. However, we are temporarily pausing further share repurchases until the expected EnerBank closing date in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being back in the market in the fourth quarter and expect to manage CET1 to the midpoint of our operating range by year end. Also earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a 10% increase to our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.17 per share. So, wrapping up on the next slide are our 2021 expectations, which we've already addressed. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter results and are poised for growth as the economic recovery continues. Pre-tax pre-provision income remain strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. John Turner : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. John Turner : How are you? Matt O'Connor: Good. Can you just remind us how dilutive or sorry, the impact of capital from the pending deal. I'm just trying to think of the walk on CET1 from 10.4% to 9.5% by the end of the year. David Turner : Well, I think you can -- Matt, it's David. You could take the purchase price which is $960 million, and that's the capital we're going to use. We'll pick up a little bit of balance sheet and equity with that. So when you mean around that number, call it $1 billion, which is around numbers about 1 point. Matt O'Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just talk about some of the kind of underlying loan demand, so just saying, you've had some pockets of strength and obviously there has been some pickup in COVID cases, specifically in the Southeast. And have you seen any impact in terms of behavior of that in recent weeks. John Turner : Yes. So maybe I'll start with the last question first. Our markets were when COVID originally impacted the economy there were some of the last to close and first to reopen. And we're really have seen the benefits of that, increasing activity, economic activity in our markets. We also are operating in markets that are, some, at least vaccinated. And so we have been at risk of some recurrence of COVID, the Delta variant is having some impact on the population, but we've not seen it necessarily impact the economy, yet. Loan growth has been broad-based. We're seeing increasing activity across virtually all of our markets. Growth has been across multiple segments, whether it'd be small business, middle market, large corporate. We're growing in many of our specialized industries businesses like healthcare, technology, financial services, transportation, same growth in asset based lending. And so pipelines are -- have definitely expanded, as I think the point was made, they exceed levels that we were experiencing at this same time in 2019 and the needs are for to support M&A activity, to support short-term working capital needs associated with expansion in businesses, growth in commodity prices. And also increasingly some fixed capital investment which I think is a very good sign and then -- and frankly is a green shoot, we've been looking for. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question... John Turner : I should say on the -- just as a follow on the consumer side as well, we obviously had good mortgage production. We expect to begin to see some growth in card as the level of payments comes down and spend increases. So that should be positive as well. Operator : Your next question is from Jennifer Demba of Truist Securities. John Turner : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. Question on expenses. Just wondering how much wage pressure you're seeing? And how much you're seeing of potential coaching of your employees? I know there's a big war for talent out there right now. David Turner : Yes, Jennifer. It's David. So from an expense standpoint, you could see our numbers, we're controlling that very well. I think it's in a day as we manage our human capital. It's providing a great place to work and we received a number of awards on that front. We're obviously in this transition period post our, I guess, still in the middle of the pandemic, but starting to return to work, but having some return to the office, I should say, we've been working the whole time, really providing some flexibility for our workforce. So I think, when you create opportunities like that, you have to pay people fair market value. We think we do that. So we haven't seen any big trends that have gone the other way, but we're cognizant of the fact that people have alternatives, when we're working at a remote environment. And I think being able to adapt to that and have flexibility, there will be a way to deal with it. So the answer I guess, short answer is, no, we haven't seen that yet. Jennifer Demba : Are you able to -- at this point, are you able to quantify how much money you can save in the area of real estate by having a more flexible work environment or totally remote work environment for some of your employees? David Turner : We can do some math around that, Jennifer. But it's probably a little premature to do so. We're working with a number of different opportunities. So for instance, in our contact center, we are 100% remote. And so the question is, will that remain that way. And if so, does that affect space over the long haul. That's just one example, there are going to be a number of those. I think we need to get a little more time under our belt, certainly it leads you to believe that in time, our square footage ought to come down and but I just don't know that we could quantify that at this point. Jennifer Demba : Okay. And one more question, if I could. On your newer branches, you mentioned the amount of deposit growth, you've seen from newer branches over the last few years, what are the plans for new branches as you look ahead in next one or two years? David Turner : I think you're going to see us continue to trend that we have -- we are going to consolidate our branches when it makes sense. We're going to make investments in markets that we think where we build out our density. And so you'll continue to see some new branches. The power of the new branches, we are really contributing disproportionately to our growth from those De Novo branches, but we also have to acknowledge the fact that we do have investments in digital are important as well. So, I think as we optimize our branch footprint, we're going to look for consolidation opportunities where we can take 2 for 1 or 3 for 1 branch consolidation where it makes sense in a given market to be as efficient as we can while maintaining access for our customers. They don't want to have them travel too far to our branches. So we're going to continue to optimize our retail network as you have seen us do overtime. Jennifer Demba : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. John Turner : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, John. Good morning, David. David Turner : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : David, can you share with us, when you think about you guys gave us some good data about the pressure that you're liquidity is causing on your net interest margin even when you exclude the PPP loans. Can you share with us what the reasonable amount and money or size, I should say that that liquidity should be, so how much more are you carrying today than you would be comfortable with the way your balance sheet is shaped up today? And second, how long do you think it's going to take for you to kind of win that down to that level that you think is appropriate? David Turner : Let me start with the end of second part of the question. So as the Fed continues to be less accommodative, I think that liquidity in the system will start to go the other way. We don't expect -- we didn't expect the growth we had this past quarter. So it continues to come in, of course, we have childcare credits, things of that nature that will probably pay to the liquidity. So, we're carrying on average about $23 billion sitting at the Fed, earning 15 basis points. We'd love to redeploy that in a more meaningful manner, but sitting here where we are with the tenure and trying to invest mortgage-backed security is probably ill-advised. Normally we had been -- that number has been, call it $1 billion, maybe $2 billion in normal times. So it's a tremendous number. We do think the surge deposits that we've had this year, $30 billion, that, we think 20% to 30% of that will persist on the balance sheet as we mentioned. I have a higher beta on it but, nonetheless, the question of timing really is centered on the economic recovery. And what the Fed does with its balance sheet, and if lower rate environment, more accommodation deposits means deposit linger longer, if in fact, the economy continues to rebound, we get the virus under control, when we start seeing GDP growth, people putting their cash to work and maybe we see it run out a little faster. So it's really, really hard to tell. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, thank you. And John, you gave us some color about the outlook for loan growth, maybe, can you give us, elaborate a little further on that loan pipeline that you talked about? Can you share with us, what the pull-through rate is? And I know in terms of loan pipelines, it can be as simple as your loan officers had a conversation with the potential client to somebody who has actually signed a contract with you guys. And it is a line of credit established and therefore that's more likely to come through as a loan than the first contact. So can you give us some color of the pipeline and how it looks compared to prior quarters? And what do you think the pull-through rate should be? John Turner : Yes, great question, Gerard. And when I asked Ronnie Smith just a few weeks ago, because they -- a lot of the outcome is the function of how the loan officer, relationship manager assesses the opportunity, when they put it in the pipeline. The good news is that our 75% probability pipeline, we're pulling through more than 90% of the opportunities that we believe we're going to win. So one of the reasons, you sense a little more confidence from us in our ability to grow is that we are seeing good opportunities and we believe at least at this point we're winning most of those good opportunities when we believe we have an opportunity to do that. So, I feel good about pipeline management and the efforts that our teams are putting forth to win new opportunities. Gerard Cassidy : And is that pipeline considerably higher in this quarter versus 1Q or 4Q or slightly our it is slightly high? John Turner : It's a good bit higher than then 1Q -- it's slightly higher, I guess than 1Q. We began seeing some momentum build toward the end of the first quarter. It is, as I recall, 30% plus higher than it was this time two years ago. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Turner : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Also on the loan front, just wanted to ask about production, front-end production. Can you -- do you have some quantifications around how that, how much that was up on a linked quarter basis? And then how much, where it compares versus pre-pandemic? John Turner : So new loan production in our Corporate Bank was up 23% linked quarter. I don't have that number right in front of me, but we'll get it while we're here on a two-year look back. David Turner : Yes. I think the -- so the growth in total production... John Turner : New production is what I'm referring to 23%. David Turner : Yes, total new and renewed was up 33%. But if we exclude PPP quarter-over-quarter is up 50%. And how that compared to pre-pandemic will -- yes we'll look that up as we go through the call and come back to you. That's what I think, the best of memory. John Pancari : Okay. Yes, no problem. And one other thing on that topic and then I have one other follow-up is, your line utilization at 39.5%, how does that compare to your normalized level? John Turner : Typically, we run 44%, 45%, so we're 400 basis points to 500 basis points shy of where we'd normally operate. And each 100 basis point differential means $575 million, $600 million in loan growth. John Pancari : Got it, okay. And then separately [ph], I know you indicated your service charges could remain 10% to 15% below 2019 levels. Part of that is the overdraft dynamic. Can we just confirm, your overdraft fees annually, they total about $300 million annually? And then secondly, where do you see that going, as you see the continued change in behavior? And maybe a little bit of governmental scrutiny around the overdrafts again. David Turner : Yes, John. So, your number is reasonably close to that. I think everybody has hit around that number. And our anticipation of all the things that we've done, our anticipation of customer behavior, our transparency, we're providing which is allowing customers to understand where they stand intraday on things that will pose to their account, the following night of a given day gives them more opportunity to take care of a negative account situation.  So we've tried to anticipate what all that is and our guidance on our service charges being down 15%, it was done because of that. It was done because we are doing things to help our customers. We reduced our overdraft caps and things of that nature in a given day. So now you've asked a question what could happen. We don't -- we don't know, we're trying to do what we think is the right thing, and what the government and regulators do. We'll have to adapt and overcome, if there is any change at all. So, I think our 15% below the -- 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic is our best answer at the moment. John Turner : And I think I'd just add, John that, as we have provided our customers more tools to better manage their finances, we've seen NSF/OD fees decline over time. So if you look back 10 years and come forward to today, there has been an over 40% decline in NSF/OD fees that we recognized. So I'll call that, I guess on average about 4% a year from customers just managing their finances better. We've grown our customer base over that period of time. So you'd have to assume there are fewer incidences of NSFs and overdrafts. And I think that, that trend will continue. And as David said, we're prepared for that, through growth and other fees associated with growth in our business, whether it'd be debit card transactions associated with a high level of debit card activation and growth in checking accounts, growth in wealth management, capital markets and other sources of mortgage, other sources of fee income. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. John Turner : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning, how are you doing? John Turner : Good, thank you. Betsy Graseck : So, I wanted to dig in a little bit on the EnerBank acquisition strategy. I know you have some nice slides in the back talking about what the activity is in your footprint. Could you give us a sense as to how the activity SKUs in the non-Regions branch footprint? And then what are you going to bring to this business? How are you going to ramp this going forward? John Turner : Yes. So, it's -- today, we estimate the marketplace, is about $176 billion annual origination market across a couple of different categories of home improvement. EnerBank has been particularly active in HVAC and pools, have a growing presence in solar. And we have been observing, participating in indirectly, the point-of-sale lending space for now six or seven years and have aspired to have the opportunity to have an origination vehicle, if you will, and we think EnerBank provides that.  We've built our consumer lending strategy around lending around the home, if you will. So we've been investing in mortgage. We're making some improvements in our equity loan in line products and we think EnerBank is sort of the third leg of that lending around the homes to, with a focus on home improvement and point of sale lending at the -- to the consumer.  In terms of what we bring, we bring balance sheet. EnerBank's growth has been constrained to some extent by their willingness if you will, the parent company's willingness to fund their growth. And, we of course, have significant liquidity and a balance sheet and a desire to continue to grow that business. We bring banking products and services to EnerBank's customers, which we think we can more broadly deliver and deepen those relationships, which benefits EnerBank as well. And then, which bring overall capacity and an existing customer portfolio that we think we can market into across our footprint. So we believe the combination, really powerful. We think we can be a nice asset for growth. Nice, on a set of products to offer to our existing customers and at the same time, nice group of customers to sell our products into to meet EnerBank's customer needs. Should be a good combination. David Turner : I'll add, as it relates to production, so 55% of their production is in our existing footprint, obviously 45% is not. And so, we're looking at continuing to build out and diversify throughout the country on this particular product.  One of the things that we bring that they did not have is, as you know, the yield is roughly 9% with 2.5 points of that coming from the contractor, the dealer and the other is the customer. And so, if somebody takes out a loan and then refinances, we are going to be there, that's going to be our customer now that we have a mortgage opportunity for.  So, if that happens, those fees get accelerated. And so, whereas EnerBank would have received that they wouldn't have gotten the benefits of the mortgage. We're going to be able to get that and the fees.  So we just think it's going to be very powerful. The last piece of this, I'll say, as John mentioned, is a large industry, but it's incredibly fragmented where EnerBank only represents 1% of that production and we think over time we're going to be able to penetrate this market much deeper than what they've been able to do primarily because of our funding. Betsy Graseck : Right. I mean, when you look at the filings, it looks like they were selling out half of their originations historically and obviously you'd be able to retain that. David Turner : That's correct. Betsy Graseck : The other question I had is, you mentioned that you are looking at more incremental M&A opportunities, and wondering what gaps you still have or what you're most focused on growing? John Turner : Well, we want to continue to add to some specific capital markets capabilities. We have a very good mortgage servicing rights group and so we're interested in potentially acquiring more and more mortgage servicing rights. We want to continue to, as David said, potentially grow and expand what EnerBank is doing. I think in wealth management, there is some potentially some opportunities to gain some additional capabilities there as well. So fairly -- fairly broad based is we think about other opportunities to grow and diversify our revenue and to acquire capabilities to help us meet customer needs. Betsy Graseck : And the mortgage servicing rights piece, how does that fit in to customer needs? Can you just give me the strategic bullet point on that? John Turner : Well, it's -- we think it just continue to support the capabilities we have and continues to drive efficiencies through that particular unit. So, it's as much about benefits to the shareholder, I guess, as it is, meeting customer needs. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. John Turner : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning, guys. Hey, just a follow-up on your -- on the swap book. David, you said that you don't anticipate making any other changes to the book as it is. And just wondering how you philosophically think about that against what's happened with the rate curve and the excess liquidity? I'll start with that. David Turner : Yes, Ken. I think all the adjustments that we see right now we've made, but that -- we also had a caveat, and then, this is a pretty dynamic environment. So as circumstances change, we'll also adapt and overcome, we've talked about, we think there's a misunderstanding on our swap book, we do have a long terms, five year terms on our swaps. And as conditions change and we see an opportunity for rising rates, then you would expect us to take off some of that protection for low rate environment, protection that we have for the low rate environment. So that we can benefit as rates rise. That being said, we are naturally asset sensitive more so than many banks because of our deposit base. And so the repositioning of moving those notional amounts to a different period of time to help protect us when the economy actually rolls over the other way and the Fed becomes more accommodative. So, it's very dynamic. What we want to do is make sure we have an appropriate interest rate risk program that lets us benefit regardless of what the rate environment is. And that's on every day -- we have a whole group of people, that's what they do every day. And so we've made the changes we think necessary thus far, but we're going to continue to watch it. Ken Usdin : Understood. And just as a follow-up to that, then David, the $105 million benefit run rate that you mentioned, how far quarterly of a line of sight do you have on that level? And when in '23 does that start to drip a little bit as this is the natural role. I know obviously kept in concert with hopefully by then, rates have gone up as an offset. David Turner : Yes, I mean that's the point. I'm glad you mentioned that. That's exactly the point we're trying to make. So if you just looked at the hedge benefit of $105 million, I think we have. We put that in the slide, if we didn't do at this time, we actually have a slide that show it drifting down lower as you go through 2023. But that's based on today. Over time, that can change, because if we reposition certain derivatives, we're not going to be benefiting from the derivative or we'll be benefiting because rates are higher on the rest of our loan portfolio. The purpose of the hedge was to protect us, not reduce [ph] NII and margin. It was to protect us if rates stayed low, which they have done. And so, when you think about giving up, if you will benefit from our derivatives, because either their term comes or we terminate them, it's because we're winning on our whole portfolio that helps offset and then some for NII growth. Hopefully, that makes sense. Ken Usdin : It does. Okay. Thanks for that, David. David Turner : Let me go back to John Pancari's question on loan production. So, John, when you -- if you go back to the second quarter of '19 and you compare that production level to what we just had, it's a little over 100%, so a little bit more than double, what that production was at that time. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of context. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. John Turner : Good morning. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning, John and David. Following up on your comments around the enhancements to your overdraft practices, can you give a bit more color on whether you're combining those enhancements with the marketing message on your consumer friendly practices so that hopefully those enhancements translate into greater retention and/or attrition? John Turner : We are -- we are reaching out to customers, reaching out to across our associate base, making sure that everyone understands the benefits we're providing and hopefully that translates into frankly customers beginning to increase utilization of the tools that we're providing. We're not saying early, early, we're seeing some nice pickup in alerts as an example, which I think is a key tool that customers can and will use to help them better manage their finances. We should be introducing our bank-on [ph] product, it's been approved and should be live sometime later this quarter. And we think that's another enhancement that when combined with the other changes, we're making. We'll send a real positive message to our customers. Bill Carcache : Got it. Separately, following up on bank, can you give a bit more color on the cross-sell opportunity across the thousand plus contractor network and sorry if I missed this, but over time, do you intend to extend the business model nationally outside of where EnerBank originates loans today or is there a reason, you need to stay closer to you now? John Turner : Well, I think they're originating loans across the country today and we don't intend to change that. The good news is that 55% plus of their originations are in our footprint and that makes some sense when they're financing HVAC and pool, swimming pools, you'd naturally think that a good bit of that activity is going to occur in the southeast. And so will contain a lean into that. In terms of cross sell, we're just beginning to have conversations with the leadership team there about how we'll go about it, but we have a similar effort underway, if you will with Ascentium Capital. And we're already beginning to see the benefits of that activity. So we'll have a template of sorts, with what we're doing with Ascentium and their customer base that we think we can leverage into the relationship with EnerBank. Bill Carcache : I see, I think I may have misread on slide 20, you guys have on the top right, the originations, the LTM and there are several states where there aren't any. And so I just thought that met only the ones that show, I think I misread that. So they are actually across the country. John Turner : Yes. And it's -- think about just it's a function of product, so back to three primary products being HVAC pool and so are those are largely going to be products to get originated across the Sunbelt and on the West Coast. Bill Carcache : Understood. And then, lastly on PPP with the bulk of loans forgiven by the end of this year, can you give any color on the extent to which you think, PPP help deepen the relationship with your customers that participated in the program beyond having provided support for them during the pandemic, just curious whether you think there's any future benefit from those deeper relationships? John Turner : I do. I mean I would say, customers that I run into that, I mean that was such an incredibly stressful time for customers, for bankers. In the economy, there was so much uncertainty. And our ability to meet customer needs, and to help almost 80,000 customers, receive a loan through the PPP program had a huge impact on customers and on their employees. We think that we supported saving of over 1 million jobs as a result of the loans that we made. And so I think we did generate a good bit of additional loyalty. Good news is, our loyalty scores are already very high amongst our consumer and small business customer base. But I think our participation in the PPP program and the way we responded for customers ultimately did in generally a good bit of additional loyalty. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thanks very much for taking my questions. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. John Turner : Good morning. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, John and David. I was curious, if the EnerBank deal would have been as attractive, if the excess liquidity wasn't as high, because the excess liquidity kind of help justify the transaction. John Turner : I think that, I'll let David speak to the finances, but just purely from a strategic perspective, as I said earlier, we've been participating in through an indirect relationship, actually through indirect relationships we had. We've been participating in point of sale or unsecured lending to consumers on an indirect basis largely to support home improvement not entirely. And it has been our desire to find a way into that space as we've seen consumers migrate their borrowing from banks traditionally to these point of sale lenders. And so we've had an interest. We also -- as I mentioned are focused on lending around the home and meeting customer needs through three different sort of product channels. First, mortgage [indiscernible] loan and then third, this point of sale lending activity. So, we've been looking and interested for some time and we think EnerBank is a great opportunity for us, really well-run company, we like the team and the relationships they have, and so I believe it would have been just as interesting to us. But David, if you want to... David Turner : Yes, financially, it would -- the fact that we had, idle cash, and is incrementally beneficial, but we would have still done the transaction with the debt financing. I mean the return on capital, return on investment that we're going to experience and continuing to grow. And we think that's -- at the end of the day, what our investors really want us to do with our business and the capital we generate instead of buying stock back and things of that nature is to invest in the business and grow and to make smart acquisitions where you get a disproportionate return. And you creating a product capability to serve existing customers and grow new ones that you can cross-sell to as we just talked about whether it be the 10,000 contractors or all the folks, individuals that have loans. So this was not done because of that. That was independent. Christopher Marinac : That's helpful. Thanks for walking through that background. I appreciate it. John Turner : Sure, thank you. Operator : The final question is from Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Spahr : Thank you. Good morning. So first, I'd like to give you, commend you on actually you have good digital disclosures, one of the best amongst all regional banks. So my question is going to be tech related. So what's your outlook for your $625 million tech budget given opportunities to grow accounts and target specific customers as well as like optimizing your contact center, 100% remote, I don't think there's any other bank that's like that. And then second, my follow up would be, at what point do these investments become self-funding and when do you expect to get there? John Turner : Well, I wouldn't speak to the first part of the question. I'm not sure about the self-funding. I guess it's -- our hope is over time as we make investments, the cost of computing comes down and we're able to make continuously make investment. We said we're spending about $625 million as we pointed out, roughly 10% of that is dedicated to cyber security and defending our, the bank and our customers. Approximately 48% we said is dedicated to keeping the bank going to maintaining operations, and 42% support innovation and new ideas. And we're going to continue to -- to make those investments and we believe through doing things like improving our mobile app, through digitizing the account origination process, through giving our bankers, whether in the branches or commercial wealth RMs [ph] more digital tools to assist customers, e-signature capabilities across the footprint, drives digital usage. At the same time we want to make sure that we're investing in capabilities to give customers more self-service options that allow them to use all of our channels and have the same great experience whether they're at an ATM, in a branch or using their mobile or online app or talking to the call center that will be really important to us as we continue to try to meet customer expectations for convenience and speed of transaction more self-service options. So, I think as we make those investments they create process improvements, they help us drive efficiencies and effectiveness consistent with our desire to continuously improve and that generates more funding for reinvestment and technology and innovation. We believe that model and we prove that that model works over the last three plus years and we expect it will continue to work is an important part of our strategic plan. David Turner : Yes, Chris. I'll add. I think, so we're spending 10% of our revenue, technology. We expect to grow revenue over time and as a result, technology spend will increase. You've asked a very good question, and to the folks that work for Regions, I promise I didn't have Chris plant this question, because that's what we ask all the time is we're going to spend this kind of money, where is our return, when you're going to be on your own and that's hard to answer, Chris, but certainly we challenge ourselves all the time to make sure, every dollar that we spend is meaningful. And that we're not just spend in technology, spend technology, what would benefit does our customer get and what benefit do our shareholders get from the spend. It's a continual challenge and I think we're in pretty good position for that, but it's hard to give only, kind of give a project exactly when that's self-sustaining. Christopher Spahr : Thank you very much. John Turner : That's it. Okay. Operator : As there are no other questions. John Turner : Great. Well, I'll just close by acknowledging the great work of our teams. These are still somewhat uncertain times and I think our teams remain focused on the things that we can control, particularly focused on taking care of our customers. And I think that, those benefits are beginning to appear in our results. So, I appreciate the work our teams have done. I thank all of you that participated today for your interest in Regions. Have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 third quarter 2021 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved earnings of $624 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.65. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income increased 4% sequentially, and we generated year-to-date positive operating leverage. Our ability to keep the momentum going and deliver solid third quarter results comes from three primary factors. First, we continue to benefit from our growing footprint. Unemployment levels are improving and most of our markets are well below the national level. People and businesses are continuing to move into our 15-state footprint and that bodes well for our growth prospects for the remainder of the year and into 2022. We'll continue to make strategic investments in core and growth markets where we can grow new customers and deepen existing relationships. On that note, we're also pleased to share that year-to-date, net account growth has exceeded account growth for the preceding three years combined. Second, credit quality has demonstrated incredible resiliency and continues to exceed our expectations. Businesses across all industries have found ways to adapt and prosper despite ongoing supply chain and labor issues, and consumers continue to cautiously manage their finances. Overall, we feel very good about the health of our business and consumer customers. Third, we continue to take advantage of opportunities to invest in talent, technology and capabilities to support growth. For instance, earlier this month, we closed our acquisition of EnerBank, a leading home improvement point-of-sale lender, a key part of our strategy to serve as a premier lender to homeowners. We also entered into an agreement to acquire Sabal Capital Partners. Sabal has a strong reputation and proprietary technology platform that will expand our real estate capital markets capabilities. Once the transition is complete, we expect to be a top five bank agency producer. The EnerBank and Sabal acquisitions complement our existing portfolio price and capabilities in the consumer and corporate bank. We will continue to evaluate prudent non-bank M&A opportunities that will allow us to expand our products and services and enhance our relevancy with our customers. Also, we recently launched our bank-owned certified Now Checking account. This new product has all the benefits of a traditional checking account without the concern of overdraft fees. And finally, our investments in digital and data are positioning us for growth. Through a technology-enabled seamless experience in branches and across all platforms, customers are responding to the personalized service, advice and guidance they receive from Regions. Today, more than two-thirds of our customer transactions are digital. Further, over the last two years, active mobile banking users are up 23% and notably, Zelle transactions have more than tripled. We feel really good about our progress and momentum. We operate in some of the best markets in the country, have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and the experience to compete effectively. We focus every day on delivering products and services that are valued by our customers, while continuing to support our communities and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders. Now, David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average and ending loans increased approximately 1% during the quarter, although business loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity pipelines have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In addition, production remained strong, with line of credit commitments increasing $2 billion year-to-date. Consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production, accompanied by modest growth in credit card. However, consumer loans remain negatively impacted by exit portfolios and further pay-downs in home equity. Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits. With respect to loan guidance, we are not including any impacts from our EnerBank acquisition, which closed on October 1 and resulted in the addition of $3.1 billion in loan balances that will benefit the fourth quarter and beyond. So, let\u2019s turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances. However, as John mentioned, we are also producing strong new account growth. We are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior. And based on analysis of pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics, we currently believe approximately 30% or $10 billion to $12 billion of deposit increases can be used to support longer-term growth through the rate cycle. Additional portions of the deposit increases could persist on the balance sheet but are likely to be more rate-sensitive. Let\u2019s shift to net interest income and margin. Pandemic-related items continue to impact net interest income and margin. Net interest income from PPP loans decreased $12 million from the prior quarter but is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter. Cash averaged $25 billion during the quarter and, when combined with PPP, reduced third quarter reported margin by 54 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, net interest income grew almost 1.5% linked quarter and our adjusted margin was essentially stable at 3.30%. This reflects strengthening loan growth as well as active balance sheet management efforts despite a near-zero short-term rate environment. Similar to prior quarters, the impact on NII from historically low long-term interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies, lower deposit cost, and higher hedging income. During the third quarter, we repositioned an additional $5 billion of received fixed swaps. We\u2019re short in the maturities from 2026 to late 2022. The repositioning locked in the associated gains that will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swaps and will allow for more NII expansion when rates are projected to increase. Further, with the inclusion of EnerBank\u2019s fixed rate loan portfolio, less hedges will be needed to protect NII and the net interest margin profile from falling rates. The accumulative value created from our hedging program is approximately $1.6 billion, roughly 75% of that amount has either been recognized or is locked into future earnings from hedge terminations, reflecting the dynamic management of our hedging strategy. Excluding EnerBank and PPP, adjusted net interest income should be relatively stable in the fourth quarter after excluding the non-recurring interest recovery in the third quarter. Including PPP and the EnerBank acquisition linked quarter net interest income is expected to grow between 5% and 6% in the fourth quarter. As illustrated on the slide over a longer horizon, a strengthening economy, the ability to benefit from higher rates and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive net interest income growth. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income increased 8% from the prior quarter, primarily attributable to strong capital markets activity including record loan syndication revenue and solid M&A advisory fees. We expect capital markets to remain strong in the fourth quarter, generating revenue in the $60 million to $70 million range, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. We will provide more specificity regarding 2022 expectations in January. Other noninterest income also increased during the quarter due to an increase in the value of certain equity investments, as well as increased gains associated with the sale of certain small dollar equipment loans and leases. Mortgage income decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments, partially offset by improved secondary market gains. Service charges remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter, but we continue to expect they will remain 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels. We attribute the decline to changes in customer behavior, as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices, including transaction posting order. Card and ATM fees remain stable compared to the second quarter. Debit and credit card spend remain above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to benefit from elevated account growth and increased economic activity in our footprint. Given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020 and excluding the fourth quarter benefit from our InterBank acquisition, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be up modestly compared to the prior year. But this will ultimately be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness. Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 3% in the quarter as higher salary and benefits and professional and legal fees were offset by a decline in marketing expenses. Salaries and benefits increased 4% primarily due to higher variable based compensation associated with elevated fee income as well as one additional day in the third quarter. Associate head count also increased by 149 positions during the quarter with the vast majority of those within revenue producing businesses. Further, exceptional performance, particularly in credit, is also contributing to higher incentive compensation. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. Excluding approximately $35 million of core run rate expenses associated with our fourth quarter EnerBank acquisition, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to be up modestly compared to 2020, and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. From an asset quality standpoint, we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter as overall credit continues to perform better than expected, reflecting continued broad-based improvement across virtually all portfolios and continued recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values. Annualized net charge-offs decreased 9 basis points during the quarter to 14 basis points, representing the company's lowest level on record post our 2006 merger of Equals. In addition to lower charge offs, non-performing loans and business services criticized loans also improved while total delinquencies remained unchanged during the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses declined 20 basis points to 1.8% of total loans and 283% of total non-accrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 1.83%. The decline in the allowance reflects better-than-expected credit trends and the continued constructive outlook on the economy. The allowance reduction resulted in a $155 million benefit to the provision. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs, greater certainty with respect to the resolution of remaining risks to credit losses, as well as the integration of EnerBank. Year-to-date net charge-offs are 25 basis points and we expect full-year 2021 net charge-offs to approximate that same level, which includes the impact of EnerBank and excludes the benefits of any future recoveries that may occur. With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to an estimated 10.8% this quarter. As previously noted, we continue to prioritize the utilization of our capital for organic growth and on bank acquisitions like EnerBank and Sabal that propel future growth. Beyond that, we'll use share repurchases to manage our capital levels. Share repurchases were temporarily paused ahead of the EnerBank closing, which absorbed approximately $1 billion of capital in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being back in the repurchase market this quarter and expect to manage common equity Tier 1 to the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range by year end. So, wrapping up on the next slide, our 2021 expectations which we've already addressed. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and are poised for growth as economic recovery continues. Pre-tax pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well-controlled, credit quality is outperforming expectations, capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. John Turner : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : Good morning. I wanted to ask about the loan growth, and I was wondering if you could just talk about where the loan growth was coming from on the commercial side and is it more a function of the new account growth that you're seeing? John Turner : Yeah. So I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we are beginning to see a little improvement in line utilization in line utilization. Line utilization was up 30 basis points in the quarter, and that trend is continuing through the first couple of weeks of the fourth quarter. Production is up to levels consistent with pre-pandemic levels, so essentially two times what we were experiencing about a year ago. Commitments are up by over $2 billion, and that's largely the result of new relationships that we're adding resulting from disruption in markets that we're operating in and talent we've been able to acquire. Growth is occurring in some of our specialized industry businesses; transportation, healthcare, financial services, technology and defense are all generating and finding new opportunities, and our pipelines are again back at pre-pandemic levels and 2 times essentially what they were about a year ago. So good activity despite labor shortages, supply chain issues constraining the economy a bit, our markets are doing well. Our customers have a positive outlook on the economy and the future. And as a result, we are beginning to experience some loan growth and feel good about the prospects for 2022. Peter Winter : Great. That's helpful. I wanted to ask about deposit betas. In your asset sensitivity model, can you just talk about what you're assuming for deposit betas today versus how that compares to last time the Fed was raising rates? David Turner : Well, Peter, it's David. So our deposit betas would have been kind of through the cycle last time kind of upper 30s, 40% range, maybe a little above that. And right now, what we're trying to gauge is the surge deposits that we had some $35 billion to $36 billion of surge deposits where we said 30% of those we think can be put to work. The other 70% is likely to either run off or come at a much higher cost. When you think about the 70% of surge deposits, that beta is going to be substantially higher than our core. We would peg that closer to 75% on that component part. But just remember, when \u2013 in the last rate cycle, we were one of the lowest deposit betas, and that's the value of our franchise, low-cost, low volatile deposit side and we\u2019re looking to extract value out of as we get a more normal rate environment. Peter Winter : Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. John Turner : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. David, I just wanted to ask you to expand a little bit more on your \u2013 just how you're thinking about that long-term repositioning. I saw in the deck that you've now walked in or realized 75%. And so there\u2019s always a back and forth here between keeping that income and positioning for higher rates. So as you think forward and as we get closer to hopeful rates going up, what do you \u2013 where do you want to be positioned at that point in terms of the asset sensitivity profile? David Turner : Well, so our goal is never really to take a lot of interest rate risk and try to win because we've taken big bets. We're trying to gauge where we think rates are going to be. Obviously in 2018, we anticipated rates declining. We put on our forward starting swaps to protect us in the down rate. As we get more confidence that the economy can reopen and that the Fed is likely to raise rates, we want to take some of that protection off which we've done, and that's what the repositioning of the $5 billion did. Today, we have about $20 billion of notional protection, received fixed swaps, in particular. We have some others in floors. But for the most part, they're in swap form. And that protection goes through 2022 where we start gauging the fact that there's a little bit more probability of rates starting to rise towards the end of 2022. And we want to participate in that, that rate environment. So our slide on Page 8 was trying to demonstrate how we hand off from the protection that we have in the low rate environment to let the rates carry us up as the swaps either terminate on their own or because we terminated them as we did with the $5 billion. We locked in that gain and will enjoy that benefit through the remainder of the swap period. Ken Usdin : Yeah. Great. That is a good new slide. And just on EnerBank to that point about it, can you just help us understand like what you think originations could be as you look forward to the next couple of years, like what the pace of origination could look like? I know it's going to depend on the environment. But it seems like you can definitely continue to take share as you build that book up. David Turner : Sure. So as we've discussed before, that industry is about $175 billion industry annual production each year, very fragmented. EnerBank represented \u2013 had represented about 1% of that or call it $1.7 billion of production. I think the top five players in the industry account for rate at 10% of the industry. So it's a \u2013 there's a great opportunity for us to really leverage their technology. And we think we can grow that faster than they did. But right now, we're looking at least having that kind of production of $1.7 billion on top of that. If you look at the yield on the portfolio today, you didn't ask this question, but I might add to just so you understand \u2013 everybody understands that the yield on that is right at, call it, 6% because of the \u2013 we had to mark that $3.1 billion book to market. So we don't get the fee that's paid by the dealer, which is deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over time. Our new production, on the other hand, will get that. And so you're looking at going from a 6% to 9%, 9.5% yield on the new production. If we could start growing that just a little bit faster than they have, we're going to \u2013 this is going to be a nice growth engine for us. And that's what we try to depict a bit on Slide 8. Ken Usdin : Perfect. Thanks, David. David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jennifer Demba of Truist Securities. John Turner : Good morning. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. Thanks. So a question for you, on one of the slides, you have a comparison of your loan growth over the last several years versus your peers, which is substantially below your peers. I wanted to know where you want to have it. Are you happy with the level of loan growth that you produced over those years or would you like it to be a little stronger while still maintaining lower loan losses? David Turner : Yeah. So you're referring to Slide 21, Jennifer. This is David. And, no, we aren't interested in being second to slowest growing on as depicted on the page. What we're trying to demonstrate is we had a shift strategically several years ago to focus on improving our risk adjusted return on capital because we think that's what shareholders wanted. We've gone from second to last in terms of return on tangible common equity. We'll see where we finish, but it'll be four, number four or five this year. And so it's worked and we've reduced our risk profile dramatically over time. So we've exited businesses. So an example would be our auto businesses. We've gotten out of loan-only relationships that didn't give us the full relationship value that we need and want and where we weren't being paid for the risks that we were taking and things like real estate. So we did \u2013 we've had this massive shift and we've worked through virtually all of that. There's always areas to prune, but we're ready to leverage our markets. We're in fabulous markets that we think are going to grow faster than most every part of the country. And so, as we \u2013 the economy continues to reopen. We have the liquidity and the capital to put to work. And we'd much rather do that by our stock back. And so, I think, you know, we're looking at improve our loan growth quite substantially relative to what you see on page 21. John Turner : Yeah. And I would just add, I mean, I think we've been pretty consistent to say that we expect over time assuming that we're not working through exit portfolios and other things to grow at the rate of the economy as the economy grows, plus a modest amount given the competitive position we have in a lot of markets that we operate in. We only get a little more than our fair share, but I don't expect us to grow at an outsized rate relative to the economy. Over time, there will be periods of time when we can. But in general, we want to grow with the economy possible and manage our business and a sound profitable way that produces consistent, sustainable and resilient outcomes for our shareholders. Jennifer Demba : Okay. Second question is on capital markets. You said it's going to be probably $60 million, $70 million in fourth quarter. What do you think the revenue opportunity for that business is for Regions over time? I mean, what inning are you in terms of growing the business line? John Turner : Well, it continues to evolve. If you go back to 2014, when we began to emphasize the importance of capital markets and began to acquire and develop capabilities to serve our customers, it really was making very, very modest, almost normal contribution to the company. And that's obviously changed over the last seven years as we've continued to make investments in the business. We've acquired talent, new capabilities, we've acquired businesses and we'll continue to do that. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s an upward limit on what the contribution can be. We\u2019re certainly very satisfied with the results we've achieved to-date. We've announced earlier this year that we've been approved for a Freddie license to go with our Fanny DUS license. The acquisition of Sabal, which is a fee based generating business brings with it additional HUD capabilities, small balance Fannie and Freddie capabilities to enhance our ability to generate replacement revenue. We're looking at other opportunities within capital markets to make acquisitions, so we're going to continue to make investments there. We know that our customers have needs and we want to make sure that we have the capability to meet those needs. I would expect that capital markets contribution to non-interest revenue and to the overall profitability of the company will continue to grow over time. I don't see a particular upward limit on that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Dave Rochester of Compass Point. Dave Rochester : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to hit capital real quick. I mean, it sounds like you're poised for a pretty sizable buyback this quarter if you're going to wrap up the year at CET-1 of 9.5%. So I just wanted to confirm that that's what you're seeing. And if you could give a rough range around what that could look like from a dollar perspective, that'd be great. John Turner : Well, so we're at 10-8 on common equity Tier 1. Just to remind you, we're going to use about a billion dollars of that in the purchase of EnerBank which closed October the 1. So that's a 1 percentage point. So now you're 9-8. Now you have to put your mind to what we're going to earn back out to dividend and that's the capital we have left to either A; Invest, John talked about Subal, our capital partners as a place to use some of that capital. We have other nonbank things we\u2019re working on. And we are going to prioritize investments in those nonbank acquisitions before our share repurchase. That being said, our goal is to be at 9.5 by year-end. So, if we don't get a particular deal closed during the quarter, then we\u2019ll buy our stock back, because we think 9.5 is an optimum level for our risk profile that we have in the company. Dave Rochester : Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe just switching to the liquidity strategy. It sounds like you've got a lot of momentum on the loan growth front, so some of this will obviously go towards funding that, but you still have what seems like a lot of excess cash on the balance sheet. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about how the back up in interest rates that we've seen recently may have impacted how you're thinking about growing that security flows, if at all. And where you're seeing reinvestment rates today and what you're buying. John Turner : Yeah. So, I would grant you we've gotten a better position today than we did at the end of last quarter. But we\u2019re sitting today or at least right now at 166-10. We would had hoped that, that would be closer to 2% before we started to redeploy some of that excess cash, because you're just not being paid appropriately for the duration right now. So, our securities \u2013 the cash flows we put to work today are going on in a 130-140 spot and they're coming off at about 170 to 180. We acknowledge we have a lot of cash. We just right now, want to be patient, because we think there. If we're patient enough, there's going to be a better opportunity to put that cash to work. What we don't want to do is stretch trying to make a short term gain and really get ourselves in a pickle because we're upside down in the trade and that's just not who we are. So, being patient, I think, is our best game right now. Dave Rochester : Okay. Maybe one just \u2013 one last one on the funding side. I know you guys have already made a lot of headway on reducing the high-rate borrowings you have. I was just wondering if you see any other opportunities worth mentioning to do that over 2022. John Turner : We really \u2013 we really don't. We challenge ourselves all the time and one never knows. I mean, this is \u2013 when you have a volatile rate environment, things \u2013 opportunities can present themselves as we did last \u2013 I mean, this quarter, where we took some expensive debt out. We don't really see that opportunity right now, but we'll keep an eye on it. And if there's a trade there that makes sense for us, we\u2019d do it. Dave Rochester : All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey. Good morning. Okay, I have a really basic question around just the loan sales that you did, I think, in the quarter. And I know that a lot of what you're investing is in driving future loan growth, so I was a little surprised to see that. Maybe you could give me some color as to what you\u2019re doing there. John Turner : Yeah. Betsy, I wouldn't get to -- this was not that large. There were some loans that were certainly sitting in Ascentium Capital that didn't really meet our risk profile, that didn't \u2013just wasn't the type of credit we really wanted to have. We had a pretty good bid. We tapped the bid. We made $3 million, so it wasn't all that dramatic. But that's why we did it. If we see things from time to time that we want to offload from a credit risk management standpoint, we'll do it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so, the follow-up here is regarding the underlying growth that you see ex-PPP in the C&I and the CRE box. And we know about the supply chain constraints and all of that, but we see some nice growth in some of the services businesses. Maybe you give us a sense as to where there's an opportunity to deliver on accelerating loan growth as this PPP rolls off or is this current level of non-PPP in C&I and CRE likely just go sideways from here? Just any color there would be helpful. John Turner : I think we expect expansion, Betsy. I mean, we're \u2013 again, we've seen an increase in unfunded commitments with customers who are contemplating either expanding their business, making investments, and other things that would result in growth and loan growth across multiple industries. Similarly, historically, we're going to run in about a 45% rate of line utilization. We ended the quarter just below 40%. And we're, as I said earlier, beginning \u2013 we are continuing to see a little bit of increase through the start of the fourth quarter. So, our expectation is that that we will experience loan growth across our books of business in the wholesale business in 2022 as labor becomes more available, supply chain issues begin to work themselves out, and customers can put additional capital to work. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then when you think about the consumer side of the book, what's your take on that? John Turner : We also think there's a lot of opportunity there and we talked about EnerBank and our focus on lending around the homeowner. We hadn't talked a lot about strategically why that's important to us, but we know that homeowners maintain 75% higher on average deposit balances. They use more financial services on average deposit balances. They use more financial services, which result in homeowners providing 62% to 63% more revenue-generating opportunities because they have more basic financial needs. And so our focus on mortgage, on HELOC and on point-of-sale lending to the homeowner, we think, is a really important strategic initiative. We see EnerBank in particular as an opportunity to grow our consumer lending business; also expect some expansion in card. And related to other activities we have, we think that consumer business will grow again in 2022 and beyond. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. David Turner : Hey, Betsy. This is David. I need to clean up one of my \u2013 I told you the gain on sale was $3 million. That number should be closer to $10 million. So I just want to make sure that got corrected. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : David, coming back to your comments about deposit betas, can you share with us that 70% of the surge that you've put a higher deposit beta on? What gives you the confidence to say that maybe those deposits aren't as sticky as that other 30%? And second, what would make you or not make you, but what would give you confidence to lower that deposit beta on that 70%? What do you need to see that maybe have a different expectation as we look out over the next 24 months? David Turner : Well, the biggest driver is about the 30%. So what we've done is we've captured the nature of those deposits and the types of accounts that those deposits have gone in. And we've looked at history, and the nature of the deposit categories implied, some would be retained longer than others. If we miss it, we get that we will capture more of that 70% than we're thinking. If we started to see in our discussions with our commercial customers in particular that they want to maintain higher levels of liquidity than we think they will that would be an indicator of being able to put some of that 70% to work longer. We think we're being conservative with that level, but we just need to see how the economy continues to improve. We need to have good conversations with our customers about how they're thinking about it. And there's still uncertainty out there. So, most of the surge is going to be run off is related to business services versus consumer. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. I appreciate the color there. And then the second \u2013 and I know a number of variables in your answer to this question, you talked about a moment ago not wanting to extend outside cash on the balance sheet, which was understandable. You talked about your margin, how it's being negatively affected by this excess liquidity. So, the question is, what are you \u2013 what type of rate environment do you need to see where that margin degradation is eliminated from your liquidity or is it loan growth where you could reposition some of that liquidity into loans, and therefore reducing it, and at the same time driving up the yields in the portfolio? David Turner : Yeah. It's important. Just strategically, we use our investment portfolios as a \u2013 to manage our liquidity, not to drive yield. We don't have a lot of credit risk and our investment portfolio is lower than most peers and we've neutralized really the short-term impacts of rates. What we want to do is get back to when our business is taking deposits, making loans. And we think we're in great shape and great markets to really leverage that liquidity into loan growth. That\u2019s where the driver of improvement the margin will be. We've stabilized our margin for the most part, ex-PPP in cash at 3.30. And we think that over time, obviously we can grow that and get back to a much higher margin over time. An example of that is we're going to spend \u2013 we have $3 billion of EnerBank loans that we're booking in the first quarter. As I mentioned, that has a carry of about6% on them. And our new production, consumer guys will add on in a year of $1.7 billion plus, we'll have closer to 9%. So that and our Ascentium acquisition which is also fixed rate is performing extremely well. We just continue to just stick to our knitting and execute our plan and our margin will move accordingly, and so will NII. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the M&A side, I know you mentioned it a couple of times in terms of non-bank interest, particularly in your capital discussion, maybe can you just elaborate a little bit around the non-bank areas that you're interested in specifically, and then maybe if you can also talk about potential whole bank deal interest as well? Thanks. John Turner : Yeah. So with respect to non-bank, we\u2019ve obviously been active, particularly in the capital market space. Within capital markets, announced the ball. We want to continue to add to our capabilities, whether it be an M&A or in providing access to capital markets to our commercial customers through a variety of different platforms. We don\u2019t have anything specifically in mind, but we're always looking for opportunities. Mortgage servicing rights has been an area where we've been acquisitive and we want to continue to be. Wealth management, we think there are potentially some opportunities, although lately multiples have been awfully rich. But we want to continue to look for ways to grow that business and other fee income-generating businesses that we think allow us to grow and diversify revenue and importantly provide capabilities to customers. With respect to bank M&A, I think we've been consistent in saying that bank M&A is not a strategic priority. We think that bank M&A can be very disruptive. We have a solid plan. We want to continue to focus on executing our plan. The economics of bank M&A have not looked terribly favorable in the past given where our stock traded, continue to experience improvements. So that changes the economics. We revisit the idea with our board every year as part of our strategic planning process and just come to the conclusion that we think we can generate top quartile returns for our shareholders by being focused on executing our plan, active in the nonbank M&A space. And so whole bank M&A has just not been a priority for us. David Turner : And, John, this is David. I'll add to the nonbank deal. So, as I mentioned, the prioritization to really focus our capital allocation on growing our bank, the corporate development group works with each of our segment leaders to identify capabilities that they would like to have, companies that they have products and services that we'd love to have to serve our customers. It's interesting after you do a couple of deals that we've had, you get into the deal flow a little bit more than you would before, and so we get more opportunities. We're going to be prudent about that capital allocation there and make sure things are really accretive for our shareholders as we seek to grow our business, and ultimately our risk adjusted returns. John Pancari : Great. Thanks, David. And then on the capital markets business specifically, I know \u2013 given that you're still investing in that business heavily, what is \u2013 and but also given the size it is now, what is the efficiency ratio you're achieving or the comp ratio that you're seeing in that business right now? John Turner : Well, capital markets is full of about four or five different sub businesses. Some of them have quite nice \u2013 nicely up efficiency ratios; others are not so high. We don't really think of it that way. We think of it as much as the capability we need to have that leverages all the other things that we're doing in our business services segment. So, we really look at that together. Fee-based businesses generally are as efficient, but that's okay. And I think as long as they're complementary and we're making sure we're as efficient in delivering those products and services, then we'll be okay. And if you look at our efficiency ratio over time, you know, this quarter were the second best in terms of efficiency ratio at 56.6% and looking to improve that over time, even though we're adding some of these other businesses are less efficient. John Pancari : Yes. Got it. If I could ask one more related thing just about on the comp expense linked quarter, up $14 million. I know on slide 10, you indicated that the performance of the fee business was part of that, plus the day count. How much of that quarter increase was purely from the fee performance? John Turner : So our year-to-date, our base salary number is down. Quarter-to-quarter, our base salaries were up just marginally. Most of that was really driven by incentives. And we also had about $5 million in the salary benefit line relation \u2013 related to the HR asset valuation that offset expense \u2013 offset income, about $5 million. I think if you look through the slide, you'll see that. So you need to break that out, too, or deduct that too. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Slide 8 has a medium-term potential, not just income growth but I think it\u2019s really helpful and all the drivers and a lot of that has been touched on the call here. If we were to think about how that might look for fees and expenses, any thoughts on that, either big picture or box some numbers around it? John Turner : Well, you're getting ahead of us a little bit, Matt. We're going to give you good numbers on that in January in terms of what the next few years are. Kind of as you wrap up the expense tied to all this revenue change, our \u2013 we've steadily been committed to positive operating leverage and we've done a really good job of controlling our expense base. We've been around 1% compound annual growth rate on expenses over the last four or five years. We are seeing a bit of inflation that'll impact us some and our industry, we suspect, in 2022. We've got to find ways to overcome it. And so we'll give you exactly what that commitment is in January. But the bottom line is we're growing our business. We're going to grow revenue. We're going to work on controlling our expenses and improving returns over time. Matt O'Connor: And then I guess in fees, maybe specifically there, you've talked about a couple of bigger categories in terms of service charges as well as the capital market, but anything else to comment on kind of be in terms of those categories like card and payments and\u2026 John Turner : Yeah, I think if you go down a couple line items, the card and ATM fees continue to grow nicely for us. We're up some 12% year-over-year. A big part of that is volume is up. Volume is up because there's more transactions per owner and we have more owners. You have more \u2013 when you grow checking accounts, this is what you get. You get usage, in particular debit card usage for us. And so that's why we get so fixated on making sure the investments we make in the faster-growing markets really help us grow customers and it's paying off. So you see it in the card and ATM fees. We've added wealth advisors to help us grow wealth management income. You can see we're up almost 12% year-over-year. And now a part of that is driven by the market. Market's had a nice run too. And then mortgage income, mortgage has been a little volatile. We've had nice production this year and this past quarter. But 2022 is probably not going to be as strong as it was in 2021 and 2020. Now we said that for 2021 relative to 2020, and we've had a really nice year. So who knows? But just proud of the fact that we've got a lot of different noninterest revenue sources that work in multiple different economies and rate environment. And our goal is again to continue to grow our total revenue, control expenses and control credit, and we have nice returns to the shareholders. Operator : Your final question is from David Konrad of KBW. David Konrad : Good morning. I had a follow-up question on the securities portfolio, and thanks for the color on the front book, back book. But it looks like securities yields actually went up a couple of basis points this quarter. So, curious if that was lower bond premium amortization and maybe the future benefits of higher rates that you could draw from lower expense there. John Turner : Yeah. I mean, premium amortization is about $50 million. We've benefited a little bit from that. We think next quarter could be a tad lower than that. So just around the edges, we could see some improvements there. My whole point on that was we're just not going to take the risk to juice a quarter or six months. We really want to invest for the long haul and we just don't see putting our cash to work more than we have. Now we get a different rate environment. We get a little steepness of the yield curve where we get paid for the risk and we might change our mind. David Konrad : And any color and would bond premium amortization was looking back in 2019? Was it significantly lower than $50 million or is it not that material? John Turner : Yeah. I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head. We were closer to the $40 million per quarter range. But I had \u2013 I had committed that memory. Operator : There are no further questions. John Turner : Great. Okay. Well, thank you. Appreciate it. We're really proud of the results that we reported this quarter. I think what you see is a reflection of a lot of important decisions we've made over the last few years to strengthen our business to build a bank that's going to be more consistently performing, resilient, generates sustainable returns, and so we expect to experience more of that in the coming quarters. Appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Natalia. Welcome to Regions\u2019 fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section on our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. We achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate in operating environment. Earlier this morning, we reported full year earnings of $2.4 billion in record pre-tax, pre-prevision income of $2.7 billion. Despite continued economic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we can control and our efforts are paying off. We grew consumer checking accounts by 3% and small business accounts by 5%. Notably, our 2021 net retail account growth exceeds the previous three years combined and represents an annual growth rate that is three times higher than pre-pandemic levels. We increase new corporate banking group loan production by approximately 30% and generated record capital markets revenue. Through our enhanced risk management framework, we deliver our lowest annual net charge off ratio since 2006. We made investments in key talent and revenue facing associates to support strategic growth initiatives. We continue to grow in diversify revenue through our acquisitions of InterBank with all capital partners and Clearsight advisors. We successfully executed our Libor transition program to ensure our clients were ready to move to alternative reference rates. We continue to focus on making banking easier through investments in target markets, technology and digital capabilities. We surpassed our two-year, $12 million commitment to advanced programs and initiatives that promote racial equity and economic empowerment for communities of color. Before closing, we're extremely proud of our achievements in 2021, but none of these would've been possible without the hard work and dedication of our nearly 20,000 associates. The past year posed unique challenges as we continue to transition to our new normal, both on a personal and professional level. Despite continued uncertainty, our associates remain steadfast. They continue to bring their best to work every day, providing best in class customer service, successfully executing our strategic plan and maintaining strong risk management practices, all of which contributed to our success. In 2022 and beyond, we'll continue to focus on growing our business by making investments in areas that allow us to make banking easier for our customers, all while continuing to provide our associates with the tools they need to be successful. We will make incremental adjustments to our business by leaning into our strengths and investing in areas where we believe we can consistently win over time. As announced earlier this week, a key priority in 2022 will be additional comprehensive changes to our NSF and overdraft policies, which are detailed in the appendix of our presentation. These changes represent a natural extension of our commitment to making banking easier for our customers and compliment the enhanced alerts, time-order posting process as well as our bank loan certified checking product, we launched late last year. It's important to note that the financial impact of these enhancements have been fully incorporated in our total revenue expectation for 2022. Again, we're pleased with our results and have great momentum as we head into 2022. Now Dave will provide you with some select highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet, including the impact of acquired loans from the InterBank transaction, adjusted average and ending loans group 6% and 7% respectively during the quarter. Although business loans continue to be impacted by excess liquidity, pipelines have surpassed pre-pandemic levels and encouragingly, we experienced a 240 basis point increase in line utilization rates during the fourth quarter. In addition, production remained strong with line of credit commitments increasing $4.7 billion year-over-year. Consumer loans reflected the addition of $3 billion of acquired interbank loans, as well as another strong quarter of mortgage production, accompanied by modest growth in credit card. Looking forward, we expect full year 2022 reported average loan balances to grow 4% to 5% compared to 2021. Let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continue to increase this quarter to new record levels. The increase includes impact of InterBank deposits acquired during the fourth quarter, as well as continued growth in new accounts and account balances. We're continuing to analyze our deposit base and pandemic related deposit inflow characteristics in order to predict future deposit behave. Based on this analysis, we currently believe approximately 35% or $12 billion to $14 billion of deposit increases can be used to support longer term asset growth through the rate cycle. Additional portions of the deposit increases could persist on the balance sheet or like to be more rate sensitive, especially later in defense cycle. While we expect a portion of the surge deposits to be rate sensitive, you will recall that the granular nature and generally rate insensitive construct of our overall deposit base represents significant upside for us, when rates do begin to increase. Let's shift to net interest, income and margin. Net interest income increased 6% versus the prior quarter, driven primarily from our InterBank acquisition, favorable PPP income and organic balance sheet growth. Net interest income from PPP loans increased $8 million from the prior quarter, but will be less of a contributor going forward. Approximately 89% of estimated PPP fees have been recognized. Cash averaged $26 billion during the quarter and when combined with PPP, reduced fourth quarters reported margin by 51 basis points. Our adjusted margin was 3.34% modestly higher versus the third quarter. Excluding the impact of a large third quarter loan interest recovery, core net interest income was mostly stable as loan growth offset impacts from the low interest rate environment. Similar to prior quarters, net interest income was reduced by lower reinvestment yields on fixed rate loans and securities. These impacts are expected to be more neutral to positive going forward. The hedging program contributed meaningfully to net interest income in the fourth quarter. The cumulative value created from our hedging program is approximately $1.5 billion. Roughly 90% of that amount has either been recognized or is locked in to future earnings from hedge terminations. Excluding PPP, net interest income is expected to grow modestly in the first quarter, aided by a strong fourth quarter ending loan growth as well as continued loan growth in the first quarter, partially offset by day count. Regions balance sheet is positioned to benefit meaningfully from higher interest rates. Over the first 100 basis points of rate tightening, each 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate is projected to add between $60 million and $80 million over a full 12 month period. This includes recent hedging changes and is supported by a large proportion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash when compared to the industry, Importantly, we continue to shorten the maturity profile of our hedges in the fourth quarter. Hedging changes today, support increasing net interest income exposure to rising rates positioning us well for higher rates in 2022 and beyond. In summary, net interest income is poised for growth in 2022 through balance sheet growth and a higher yield curve in an anding economy. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to elevated other non-interest income in the third quarter that did not repeat in the fourth quarter. Organic growth and the integration of Subal Capital Partners and Clearsight Advisors will drive growth in capital markets revenue in 2022. Going forward, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of $90 million to $110 million, excluding the impact of CBA and DBA. Mortgage income remained relatively stable during the quarter and while we don't anticipate replicating this year's performance in 2022, mortgage is expected to remain a key contributor to fee revenue, particularly as a purchase market in our footprint remains very strong. Wealth management income increased 5% driven by stronger sales and market value impacts and is expected to grow incrementally in 2022. Seasonality drove an increase in service charges compared to the prior quarter. Looking ahead, as announced yesterday, we are making changes to our NSF and overdraft practices, which along with previously implemented changes will further reduce these fees. NSF and overdraft fees make up approximately 50% of our service charge line item. These changes will be implemented throughout 2020, but once fully ruled out together with our previous changes implemented last year, we expect the annual impact to result in 20% to 30% lower service charges revenue versus 2019. Based on our expectations around the implementation timeline, we estimate $50 million to $70 million will be reflected in 2022 results. NSF and overdraft revenue has declined substantially over the last decade and once fully implemented, we expect the annual contribution from these fees will be approximately 50% lower than 2011 levels. Since 2011, NSF and overdraft revenue has decreased approximately $175 million and debit interchange legislation card and ATM fees another $180 million. We have successfully offset these declines through expanded and diversified fee based services and as a result, total non-interest income increased approximately $400 million over this same time period. Through our ongoing capabilities and services, we will continue to grow and diversify revenue to overcome the impact of these new policy changes. We expect 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 3.5% to 4.5% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in interest income. This growth includes the impact of lower PPP related revenue and the anticipated impact of NSF and overdraft changes. Let's move on to non-interest expense, adjusted non-interest expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation. Base salaries also increased as we added approximately 660 new associates, primarily as a result of acquisitions that closed this quarter. The increased headcount also reflects key hires to support strategic initiatives within other revenue producing businesses. We have experienced some inflationary pressures already and expect certain of those to persist in 2022. If you exclude variable based and incentive compensation associated with better than expected fee income and credit performance, as well as expenses related to our fourth quarter acquisitions, our 2021 adjusted core expenses remained relatively stable compared to the prior year. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. As a result, our core expense base will grow. We expect 2022 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 3% to 4% compared to 2021. Importantly, this includes the full year impact of recent acquisitions as well as anticipated inflationary impacts. Despite these impacts, we remain committed to generating positive adjusted operating leverage in 2022. Overall credit performance remained strong, annualized net charge offs increased six basis points from the third quarter record low to 20 basis points driven in part by the addition of InterBank in the fourth quarter. Full year net charge offs totalled 24 basis points, the lowest level on record since 2006. Non-performing loans continue to improve during the quarter and are now below pre-pandemic levels at just 51 basis points of total loans. Our allowance for credit losses remained relatively stable at 1.79% of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans increased 66 percentage points to 349%. We expect credit losses to slowly begin to normalize in the back half of 2022 and currently expect full year net charge off to be in the 25 basis point to 35 basis point range. With respect to capital, our common equity tier one ratio decreased approximately 130 basis points to an estimated 9.5% this quarter. During the fourth quarter, we closed on three acquisitions, which combined, absorbed approximately $1.3 billion of capital. Additionally, we repurchased $300 million of common stock during the quarter. We expect to maintain our common equity tier one ratio near the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range. So wrapping up on the next slide are our 2022 expectations, which we've already addressed. In closing the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter, positions us well for growth in 2022, as the economic recovery continues, pre-tax pre-provision income remained strong, expenses are well controlled, credit risk is relatively benign, capital and liquidity are solid, and we're optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets. With that we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Hi. good morning. So just going to actually, I didn't expect to ask this question, but the feedback that I got from investors in terms of the performance today, obviously your outlook is quite upbeat, is that the tangible book dilution from the deals that you announced or rather closed in the fourth quarter surprised. And David, I'm wondering if you could share with us sort of the earned back period you expect for these deals on tangible book value? David Turner : Well, we look at several factors not just tangible book value. We look at diversification of revenue. We look at return on investment because when you -- the alternative is buying your stock back, which also has a reduction in a tangible book value. So you're trying to look at the trade off between how you put your capital to work, frankly, I can't even remember what the payback was. If we were looking at a bank acquisition, that's a little different where, we would expect a payback period in three years or less, but in this case, we're looking at diversification and being able to grow and return on that investment is higher than the return we would've had if we bought our shares back. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions, first on the announcement that you made yesterday on the changes to the overdraft and sufficient fund fees. I know you sized it for 2022. Could you give us a sense as to, if that were to go in full year, full on, what that level would be, because obviously as we think into '23, need to understand how you're thinking about an annualized impact would be looking like? David Turner : yeah, so the guidance we provided Betsy is if you go back to 2019, take total service charge revenue, the impact is going to be somewhere between 20% and 30% of total service charge revenue based on 2019 revenue, once all the changes are implemented and annualized. John Turner : And that includes all the things we already have done too. So it's a cumulative number. So if you go back to that, you can calculate right and round numbers. We'll be half, we're going to have half to maybe slightly more than that done in 2022. And so, you can double that or close proximity of what the total would be. Betsy Graseck : And when you say the service charges from 2019, you're talking about the service charges from 2019 in your income statement, not what shows up as regulatory like overdraft David Turner : That's correct. John Turner : And, we think about it that way. Because, ultimately and all these fees are associated with the consumer business and as we think about how we overcome that loss of revenue, it is through growth in consumer checking accounts, additional activity, debit card usage, debit card fees, other things that come with that. And as David has pointed out earlier, if you go back to 2010, '11 timeframe and come forward, we've been able to significantly grow non-revenue while overcoming the loss of revenue associated with reg and other changes. We expect the same will be true as we look forward relative to the change we're making here. David Turner : And Betsy, just to help you out a little, if you go into our public filings and our supplement in 2019, our service charge number was $729 million. It's off that number. Betsy Graseck : Right. Right. Okay. I was just going to confirm that. All right. Great. Thank you. And then follow up question here, just on how you're thinking about the Subal acquisition and how that's going to feed into not only the income statement I heard you talk about it's in the capital markets revenue line, but maybe help us understand, is there any balance sheet impact here and the expectation that you have to grow this business from where it is today? John Turner : Yeah. So I would say the balance sheet impact will be modest. We'll have an opportunity to develop relationships that might lead to our providing credit to customers and/or opening deposit relationships. We expect that to be true for sure. The primary benefit we derive from Subal is the capabilities we have, permanent placement capabilities that we ultimately end up with, I think we're one of four or five banks in the country that will have a complete array of real estate permanent placement products, whether it be a Fanny license, Freddy licenses for large and small dollar, CMBS capabilities, we can bank our real estate customer's needs across the spectrum. And, as we've transitioned from the great recession to today, we've built, I think a really solid real estate business, real estate permanent placement revenue in 2021 will exceed $60 million. That's from $0 million in 2014 effectively. So we've been building that business around regional and national real estate developers, really strong balance sheets, good liquidity and access to capital. The portfolio has performed very, very well and we think this gives us an opportunity to extend those relationships and drive additional profitability. Betsy Graseck : And there's been some pretty recently some significant uptick in that demand for that product, right? John Turner : Yes. And, again, I think if you just look at the multifamily market and it's awfully good and those developers who like to buy and build and hold want access to both the Fanny products and the Freddy products from time to time and we've again, found that to be a great source of revenue and a wonderful way to build stronger, deeper relationships with that customer segment. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the loan growth front, I wanted to see if you can maybe give a little more color on the 4% to 5% growth expectation I have for the year and maybe if you can unpack it by a little bit of color on the growth you expect for commercial and CRE and consumer and how that could play out for the year. Thanks. David Turner : Yeah. Hi John, it's David. So first thing we have to overcome, it depends on if you look at all the average, which is where the 4% to 5% first thing you have to do is overcome PPP average, which is about $2.7 billion. So put that in your model. And if you look at areas where we can grow, clearly, we're going to get benefit off InterBank having a whole year of InterBank along with its growth that we expect and so that's a big driver of our averaging. Mortgage ought to have -- it may not have as much production as we have in '21 or '22, but we still believe we'll grow the balance sheet quite nicely from there. We expect credit card to continue to grow and then on commercial even a after you consider overcoming the PPP runoff on average of 2.7%, we think we can still grow that on top of it. As we look at the industries that we were particularly strong in '21 in the commercial space, financial services, healthcare, transportation or our asset based lending, home builder and to a lesser degree, technology, those are areas that we did see growth in quite nice growth and expect to continue into 2022 and it's been geographically diverse as well. John Pancari : Right. Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately on the operating leverage expectation, based upon your guidance, you're looking for about 50 basis points operating leverage. Could you just talk to us about how if fed hikes maybe prove to be less than expected, is that 50 basis points operating leverage still obtainable? Do you still have leverages to pull to be, to basically generate that despite any move by the fed? David Turner : Well, it certainly makes it harder, but as we've always said, our goal is to generate positive operating leverage over time and, if our revenue growth in there, then we, we double down on expense management and we obviously didn't get there this year, nor did anybody else that I'm aware of. But we believe there's a reasonable path to that and, that's why we gave you the guidance that showed you that roughly 50 basis points or more, and we have things we can do during the year that can help us get there, but yeah, rates not coming in at the pace we think, or as many as we think we'll put pressure on that calculus, but we wouldn't give up on it just cause of that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. Following up on the commentary around the positive operating leverage, I was hoping you could frame a little bit more how much variability there is around that 3% to 4% increase that you have in your outlook for expenses, as those rate hikes begin to flow through the forward curve reflects four hikes next year, but some are expecting more than that. So how does the number of hikes, I guess, to the extent that we do more, influence to the expense line and does that 3% to 4% outlook hold? And on top of that, it would be great if, you could also discuss your confidence level and being able to control the expense base, such that, you continue that you still achieve that positive operating leverage, even under different inflation scenarios. David Turner : Well, yes, a lot of there. So let me see if I can help you out. So on the expense side of 3% to 4%, a large portion of that substantial portion of that's related to the acquisitions that we had. So we closed on three deals in the fourth quarter, one of them right at the end of the year. So we'll have a full year run rate on all those coming through and that's the biggest single driver of the 3% to 4%. If you go back and look at our compound annual growth rate on expense management, we've actually done a pretty good job of controlling our expenses and we don't do that in just one area, but it's hours and benefits and furniture, fixtures and equipment and occupancy and vendor spend, all those things, we are all over and John has us our continuous improvement program still going where we're looking to improve processes each and every day, leveraging technology to help us control our expense load. So I, think in terms of the revenue side we have four baked into our guidance that we just gave you four 25 basis points moves each quarter, So on average, you get two during the year. And, it depends on, will we get 25? Will it be more than that? Will it be more than four or less than four? You have to we've told you in our guidance that each 25 basis points or $60 million to $80 million for. So you can put your model and kind of work with that. But back to the question earlier, I think from John Pancari, in terms of operating leverage, we are committed to generating positive operating ledge over time. And when things get more challenging, we'll do what we can to manage expenses. So I'll leave it at that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess one just question follow up on the overdraft. It's been a big over hang on the stock and I get your guidance around the impact this year, David, but just talk to us downside risk the industry seems to be moving away from your -- give us a sense of like the use case of why there's a subset of order fees that needs to exist and why you feel okay both competitively and from a regulatory standpoint, but that component of fees will be defendable. John Turner : Well. So as we put in our guidance yesterday, we're eliminating NSF fees altogether. We still have overdraft fees for a service that we're providing which is liquidity to our customer base, and they appreciate the ability to be able to have that liquidity and time and need. And there's a cost to that. And now we've done some things, we've given alerts, we've changed our posting order, we're going to give short -- small dollar loans. We're going to give you paycheck up to two days available in some cases and so we're doing a lot of things to make it easier for our customers to bank with us and to understand where they stand at any point in time. But if they need that liquidity, we want to be there, we've limited our -- we will be limiting our overdraft no more than three per day to which is one of the strongest in the industry. So we're doing a lot of things. We think that's a value play for our customers. They want that ability for that short term liquidity at the cost that we charge for it. Ebrahim Poonawala : Noted. And I guess just a separate question around loan growth, apologies if I missed it, but talk to us about the InterBank acquisition, what that means for growth, especially some of the non-footprint. I think half of InterBank is outside of the core Region's footprint. Give us a perspective in terms of the opportunity that you have there both in terms of what InterBank does today and how to scale that up? John Turner : Yeah. So we acquired about $3 billion worth of loans, right at the end of the -- at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We'll get all that in our averaging numbers, which is where our 4% to 5% growth is for next year, year. If their production had been about 1% of the industry, which equated to about $1.7 billion in terms of production and that's what they were doing and we think we have the ability to take that and ramp it up over time and have nice growth there. We are excited about InterBank and excited about the fact that our geographic expansion of that is outside of our core footprint. It brings us the ability to have more customers throughout the country to do other banking services with as well, including small business contractors that offer products to consumers. So it is a big portion of our growth expectation, and we couldn't be more excited about adding InterBank and the people that work there to the Regions family. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning guys. Another, just follow up on the expenses, David. Can you help us understand of the 3% to 4% growth what part of that is just organic growth? What part is actually coming from the acquisitions, getting into the run rate, and then what are you doing in terms of like offsets in terms of, continuous improvement type of efficiencies? David Turner : Yeah. Ken, as I mentioned earlier, the overwhelming majority of our growth is related to the acquisitions that we have. We've been able and will continue to control our core expenses by managing the things I talked about managing salaries and benefits and headcount and our square footage whether it be branch or office square footage, when you manage your headcount, you manage the number of computers you have to have. It's vendor spend. It's our procurement group really ensuring that from a demand management standpoint, that people that are asking for vendors and third party services really need them and when we have to have them making sure that we get the best price for the services that we're getting. That's ongoing, that's part of our continuous improvement program. And you couple that with leveraging technology and taking out processes that we have. We're not finished there. Now we to create opportunities to reinvest. So embedded in the 3% to 4% are the investments that we're making in people in our certain markets that we have, that we see opportunities for growth there. We invest in technology, people and services to help us there. So all that's embedded in the numbers that we're giving you, but cutting to the chase of the 3% to 4%, the vast majority of that is related to the acquisitions that we announced. Ken Usdin : Yeah. Understand and I apologize, I missed that comment earlier. Follow up separately, David, then just on that topic you spoke -- you terminated a little bit more this quarter. I just want to understand like, what percentage of that book is now kind of locked out from either just that you've terminated or you understand the maturity schedule and we see from your -- the color and what that expected trajectory is like. So I don\u2019t think there's much change, but can you let us know if there's anything different in terms of how you're viewing that portfolio going forward? Thank you. David Turner : Yeah, Ken so we continue to read the reason where the Fed is going in the market with regards to rates. So we took some of our protection off, it unwinds this summer. So we have a little bit more asset sensitivity that comes in, in the second half of the year, but we have to continue to monitor that because it's important, it's important for us to make sure that we have the proper sensitivity when we expect rates to go. We do. And now it's just timing. A month ago, maybe a, a rate increase or two. Now, today it's four. This morning, there are people talking about, maybe it will only be a couple. So, there's a -- this is very volatile and we're trying to do the best we can to anticipate where those rate moves are going and we've locked in a good portion of our fair value if you will, of our hedge portfolio over half. So I think that we're in good shape. We can terminate some of those, quickly if we want to put more sensitivity in but right now we think we're in pretty good spot. Ken Usdin : Do you have an upper bounds of the sensitivity and how much you let it float up and thanks for answers, David. David Turner : What we really want to do is we're not trying to top tick our margin in NII. What we're trying to do is have a repeatable, predictable income statement. What we do when rates get to a point where there's risk of it going down, we do have risk parameters in terms of how much risk we could have on NII with a 100 basis point move. But for us is really trying to anticipate where the market's going to move. So we can take full advantage there but we don't want, we don't want to have an unusual pickup in any given period, whether it be a quarter or a year, that's not repeatable, that's not helpful to us score our shareholders over time. So we're, we're trying to get back. We had given you a range of getting up to our margin in the 370% range with a normal interest rate environment. We're probably going to be in the higher 330 on a core basis this quarter coming up. So we'll have a little bit of growth there, but it's just making incremental moves on the portfolio as we see the interest rate environment change. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Morning, John. David, can you elaborate further on slide eight, where you give us the interest rate exposure, and you talked about your deposit beta, particularly in the first 100 basis points of being 25% due to the higher betas on your third deposits. Can you tell us how large on the surge deposits on the [indiscernible]? And can you give us some color on how you define surge deposits? David Turner : Yeah, so our total surge deposits just mathematically are about $39 billion, Okay. And so when you think of those surge deposits of beta reaction, there's really two things that are happening with, with those surge deposits. Of the surge deposits, about 65% of those, we think would have a -- actually a lower beta that -- I'm sorry, a higher beta that's $25 billion. And we would put that beta at 75%, right? They think it's going to be pretty high, pretty reactive. If you look at the other 35%, we think based on the nature of those accounts, that those deposits went into, that beta is going to be similar to our legacy beta with beta, which is 10% percent. Then if you take the rest of our core legacy deposits, we put a 10% beta on that as well. And if you go back and look at the last a hundred basis point rate increase that we had the last cycle, that's what the beta was. So that's the math that we've really gotten to and our guidance that we're, that we're giving you Gerard Cassidy : And, David on the surge deposit, are those excess non-operating deposits from your corporate customers or the consumers, that excess money left over from the stimulus? David Turner : Yeah, big, a big portion of those surge deposits are corporate deposits that came in that because that's the best place they could put their money. And that's why we believe, that 65% of those deposits. So call it $25 billion that 65% of the 39 it's going to be very reactive because they're corporate customers, that are likely to put, want to put those to work in a more meaningful place. And we don't need to pay up for that. So we expect those to probably either move out or to to be more expensive. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow up, you highlighted your net charge-off ratio. I think you said the lowest in about 15 years, point to net charge-offs initially probably staying around the low levels. You're sore in the fourth quarter, gradually in the second half of the year, start to head toward maybe normalization. Is that based on just because the rates are so low, that it's hard to maintain that, or is there formulaic or some underwriting that you have done that says, no, we we're going to charge slow, start to see higher the charge us later in the year, excluding of course the acquisition that may influence the reported numbers? David Turner : Yeah. It's not an underwriting change. It's a reality that obviously consumers and businesses were propped up by stimulus consumers in particular. A lot of that stimulus is running out this quarter, in terms of the child care tax credit. We've been unusually low hasn't, as has the industry. So I think that our expectation is we would start to normalize because of the runoff of the stimulus, which starts manifesting itself in the second half of the year. But that being said, it, we still think charge-off will be rather low, lower than history at 25 to 35 basis points for '22. If the economy continues to perform and consumers do well and manage money well, maybe, our charge off at the lower end of that range, so a bit of it is trying to anticipate when normal normalization will occur. Gerard Cassidy : Very good; thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank Matt O'Connor: Good morning. It might be a little bit too early to be thinking about this, but, given rate expectations of increase so much, when does that start factoring into how you're underwriting?; because obviously, if rates go up to 3%, or even more, it does put pressure on borrowers. David Turner : Well, I think Matt, one of the things, so we're talking about 4 25 basis point, moves to get off of virtually zero. If you think of a consumer, a lot of the consumer portfolios or fixed rate portfolios, so they don't end up having much of an interest rate, shocking four moves. On the, on the corporate banking side, again, four moves on them. We've been monitoring our customers, we know which, where they stand a lot of them hedge. We would expect as rates starting to start to move. We actually put on our customers would put on more hedge protection if you will. So we, again, we don't see a lot of payment shocks there. I think it's the risk is running out to stimulus. And also is there something unique in a given business or industry that could drive losses higher versus rates at this point. John Turner : But, I only other thing I'd say is the normal course of business in -- when underwriting credits, we're always stressing or interest rate sensitivity and among other things that might occur. So that would not be a change in our common current practice. Matt O'Connor: Okay And then just separately and apologies if I missed it. Your capital markets, revenue's been strong all year and, and you did increase kind of the run rate for '22, but we've seen some of your peers have really strong cap markets fees in 4Q. And I think part of it might just be a mixed issue, but maybe you could talk to that if, you didn't early and if you did, I'll, look at the transcript. Thanks. Right? John Turner : No, no, I think it's a good question. If you just look at the bulk of our capital markets revenue distributed across both capital raising and advisory services. So whether it's real estate, permanent placement M&A loans, indications, or a fixed income transact actions we are generating relatively similar amounts of revenue across those platforms. So we've got good diversity. Now we've added ClearSight advisors and we've added Sabal capital. And so when you consider the contribution that those acquisitions will make in concert with the businesses that or products capabilities that we've developed we think the run rate of 90 to 110 per quarter is appropriate. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Scouten with Piper Sandler Steven Scouten : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. So I just one clarifying question first. I wanted to make sure David, from your earlier commentary that the loan growth, the 4% to 5% does include the runoff of PPP, or is it ex-PPP impact? David Turner : No, it includes that it's that was one of the important points that it includes overcoming that and having four and a half, I mean, 4% to 5% growth on the average that you see for the year and it's in our supplement. Steven Scouten : Perfect. That's what I thought I heard. Thank you. That's great. And then maybe the one other question I had is can you talk a little bit about the hand-off kind of from the hedging income to the, the greater rate sensitivity that obviously now you're pulling forward a bit. I know you have some detail there on slide 20, but I'm just kind of wondering if you can walk through that. Is there the positive ability that a quarter to quarter basis we could see some decline is that, $114 million run rate kind of pulls down and the, the impact of higher rates pulls it back up? David Turner : Well, I mean, it, it, you could always have a little timing issue from a quarter \u2013 quarter-to-quarter, but we've got a number of things going on that chart that you can see in particular our, our growth loan growth and our EnerBank transaction that we had, but a good portion of our, hedge portfolio is locked in and we're adding the sensitivity. I've forgot to ask the question earlier, but we added a little bit of sensitivity to help us in the second half of the year. The key thing on the early moves too, is that we're, we're still very asset sensitive because of our deposit base. And so when you start seeing the first couple of moves, that beta is pretty close to zero. And so, I, think that'll aid in the handoff, but it might not be perfect. If you're looking at the, making an investment in us over a period of time, we kind of, we think we're well positioned to grow as an economy continues to grow. We get higher rates and that's where regions really shines; because our deposit base that low core, low cost core deposit base of ours has been a differentiator for us. It's just, you haven't seen the, we haven't been able to extract the value out of it because we've been in such a low rate environment, but now we're starting to see that opportunity. If in fact, we get the rate increases that the, that the Forbes have baked in. Steven Scouten : Okay. That's, that's very helpful. And just the one other point on that chart is the impact of organic growth obviously is increasing in each subsequent year in '23 and '24. Is that to convey that you think organic growth can be even better from a loan growth perspective or just that it will be more meaningful given it will be at higher rate? David Turner : Well, it's a little bit of both. I think we can continue to see absolute balance growth. we've acquired new portfolios and as I mentioned, so just one example is EnerBank; where we, added $3 billion that production there historically had been about billion seven we're in a lot of states and we have a distribution that's far better in our bank than what they would've had. And they were a regulated energy company, right? So we have the ability to, to, to take that to a new level. And so that's just one example. That's why we continue to make investments, because we see to take a portfolio and be able to push that through our network and all the people that we have working for us to continue to grow. You're also getting help by the rate environment. So that's baked into that four to 6% compound annual growth rate as well. Steven Scouten : Perfect. That's encouraging. Thanks for the coming. Yeah. Operator : Your next question from the line of Christopher Barath with Wells Fargo Christopher Barath : Good morning. So my question is about 2023 expenses. Last month you said 2.5% was kind of a core run rate for at least to think about wage increases. Is that kind of a good starting point to think about expenses for next year? David Turner : Actually Chris, we've had we've, we've seen some inflation this year that number's going to be a little bit higher as we think about merit increases, payments we need to make, to retain certain folks in particular people that are in the technology side of the house recruiting those, type things. So that two and a half's a little bit higher than that. Now that is baked into the guidance if we gave you. And so I guess bottom line is we have experienced inflation and we expect that to persist into 2022? John Turner : Now Chris's question was around 2023. If I heard you correctly. Chris? Christopher Barath : That's correct. And that, inflation that that's not transient that's going to be in the run rate for '22 and then you're going to continue now, will you be able to revert back to merit increases that are more consistent in '23? Like we had in the past and I think that's, accurate. I guess I'm trying to figure out is the difference between deal related cost that you're seeing this year versus what is going to be more of a run rate inflation or, or wage pressure? David Turner : Well, the, the main thing is of the three to 4% that we're going to experience, the vast majority of that is related to the acquisitions that we had. Christopher Barath : Okay. And then one quick follow up, please. So last month you said, I think 2% was a good starting point to put money to work and given kind of your high level of dry powder, even with the, surge deposits. Is that still your thought process or do you think it's going to be a higher level now given with the 10 years already? David Turner : No, we still think so. We think the short end as we, we told you that we probably have four short term rate increases going in this year, but we still think the, the 10 year kind of hangs out and approaches 2% by the end of the year. So it does move as much. We do think there's opportunities. There's a lot of volatility there. If we see the ability to put a billion to more, to work in the securities book and we're convicted on that, we'd be happy to, we, we have more cash idle cash than most everybody because we just have been reluctant to want to take the duration risk, because we just don't think we're appropriately compensated for it. That being said, things can change. And if we see closer to that 2% on the 10 that may persuade us to put a little bit more to work now, remember we're getting paid for all the increases on the short run short rate with the money at the fed. So we're getting paid a little bit more there. Operator : Your next question is on the line Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi David; Hi, John; So just to clarification on couple of the last two questions. So you said if the tenure gets closer to 2%, you might with some to work. So do you have anything factored into your NII guidance for reinvesting some of that liquidity or not? David Turner : No, we do not. That would be on top of what we're giving you. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then on the, on the expense question that I was just asked, so are you assuming the incentive comp increase that you had in '21 is that stays at that level in your '22 guidance? David Turner : No. It's not forecast as to stay at that level. That was a, incentive comp was up, I think, across the industry and we don't forecast it. It would remain at that level at this time. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then partly because you're assuming some of those revenues will not continue like mortgage and capital markets? David Turner : Well, no, we, given here now our revenue growth, but that's all baked into the budget. And so you, you don't get, you don't get compensated at that over par if you hit your budget, you got to have a much better year than that, which is what we, and most of the industry players did this year, but you reset your expectations. Now you're back down the par you got to start all over again. Vivek Juneja : Does that make sense? John Turner : We're yeah, increasing targets, so that will have the impact of reducing incentives. Vivek Juneja : Right, right. Okay. Makes sense and the last one for both of you loan growth, you talked about very strong pipelines which implies that you're expecting low and growth to remain good. Are you seeing that how are you seeing January? Has that continued to be strong because we obviously saw a bigger pick up later in fourth quarter. Is that continuing in these first couple, three weeks? John Turner : Yeah. Pipelines are still good. Customers are optimistic. The, they are, I think, hopeful that we'll see trends continue. They're prepared to make investments. Investments are still constrained in some measure by some uncertainty and by shortage of labor in a lot of cases. But we do have there are a lot of customers who are actively looking at investment and want to expand their balance sheets, invest in businesses. And the same is true of consumers who are spending. And so we do expect to continue to see loan growth. Operator : Your final question is from the line of the Jennifer Demba with Truist Securities. John Turner : Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Demba : Good morning. Could you just talk about your interest now and, and more non-bank acquisitions and, and where, if, if that's still the case where, where your interest lies, where, where the strongest interest lies terms of revenue diversification. John Turner : Yeah. So we're, we do continue to have an interest in non-bank acquisitions. We'd like to, I think, continue to add to some of the consumer lending capabilities that we have acquired. If those opportunities arise, invest in capital markets that I think that got a nice return on those investments and been able to leverage those new capabilities to expand relationships. We're interested in opportunities within wealth management, always looking to acquire mortgage servicing rights, if those are available and to potentially add to our mortgage business. So those would be a couple of areas where we would make investment. Jennifer Demba : Great. Thanks so much Operator : Thank you. I will turn the call back over to John Turner for closing remarks. John Turner : Okay. Well, thank you. We are awfully proud of 2021 and all that our associates have accomplished. During some very challenging times staying focused on our customers on each other, investing in our communities. We think we are carrying a lot of momentum into 2022 very optimistic about the prospects of a, of emerging and good strong economy. And so appreciate your interest and support. Thank you very much.

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Jamaria. Welcome to Regions first quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section on our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We are very pleased with our first quarter results. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $524 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.55. Despite the challenging geopolitical backdrop and elevated inflation, we remain optimistic about 2022. We have a strong balance sheet, positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. Business customers, for the most part, have adapted and are prospering in the new operating environment. New loan commitments and pipelines remain strong and utilization rates continue to increase. The consumer remains healthy. Net population migration inflows in our markets remain robust, and the majority of our footprint has returned to equal or better than pre-pandemic employment levels. Asset quality remains strong with virtually all credit-related metrics improving in the quarter, and net charge-offs remain below historical levels. The integration of Sabal, EnerBank and Clearsight are progressing as planned, and we're excited about their growing contributions. Additionally, we continue to make investments in talent and technology to support strategic growth initiatives. We kicked off 2022 with a strong start and expect to continue building on that momentum. We have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and a proven track record of successful execution. Now, Dave will provide you with some select highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans grew 1.5%, while ending loans grew 2% during the quarter. Average business loans increased 3%, reflecting broad-based growth in corporate, middle market and real estate lending across our diversified and specialized portfolios. While still below pre-pandemic levels, commercial loan line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately 43.9%, increasing 160 basis points over the prior quarter. Loan production also remained strong with linked quarter commitments up approximately $1.6 billion. Average consumer loans declined 1% as increases in mortgage and other consumer were offset by declines in other categories. Within other consumer, EnerBank interbank loans grew approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect full year 2022 average loan balances to grow 4% to 5% compared to 2021. And excluding PPP loans and consumer exit portfolios, we expect full year average loan balances to grow 9% to 10%. So let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continued to increase seasonally this quarter to new record levels. Average consumer and wealth management deposits increased compared to the fourth quarter, while corporate deposits remained relatively stable. We are continuing to analyze our deposit base and pandemic-related deposit increases. Approximately 35% of the increase or $15 billion is expected to be more stable with behavior similar to our core consumer deposit book. This segment is historically quite granular and generally rate insensitive and therefore, can be relied upon to support longer-term asset growth through the rate cycle. The remaining 65% of the deposit increases is a mixture of commercial and other customer types that are expected to be more rate sensitive or that we are less certain about their long-term behavior. We assume this segment may have all-in beta of roughly 70%. This elevated beta assumption includes relationship repricing and some balances shifting from noninterest to interest-bearing categories. It also reflects a range of $5 billion to $10 billion of balance reduction attributable to tightening monetary policy. The combination of these segments and our legacy deposit base represents significant upside for us as rates increase.  So let's shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income was stable quarter-over-quarter. Excluding reduced contributions from PPP, net interest income grew 2% benefiting from solid loan growth and rising interest rates. Net interest income from PPP loans decreased $27 million from the prior quarter and will be less of a contributor going forward. Approximately 93% of estimated PPP fees have been recognized. Cash averaged $27 billion during the quarter; and when combined with PPP, reduced first quarter's reported margin by 58 basis points. Our adjusted margin was 3.43%, higher by 9 basis points versus the fourth quarter. The path for net interest income enters the second quarter with strong momentum from both balance sheet growth and higher interest rates. Excluding PPP, average loan balances grew 2% in the first quarter and a similar amount of growth is expected next quarter. Roughly $1.5 billion of securities were also added late in the quarter, further benefiting future periods. The recent run-up in rates has certainly validated our decision to wait to deploy into securities. And while not included in our current outlook, additional securities would provide incremental benefit. Higher short- and long-term interest rates provided additional lift to net interest income in the first quarter. And these benefits are expected to expand in the coming quarters. Total net interest income is projected to increase 5% to 7% in the second quarter and is expected to accelerate throughout the year such that the fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be approximately 15% higher than our first quarter. Regions' balance sheet is positioned to benefit meaningfully from higher interest rates. Over the first 100 basis points of rate tightening, each 25 basis point increase in the Federal funds rate is projected to add between $60 million and $80 million over a full 12-month period. This benefit is supported by a large proportion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash, which compares favorably to the industry overall.  Over a longer horizon, a more normal interest rate environment or roughly a 2.5% Fed funds rate will support our net interest margin goal of approximately 3.75%. While we have purposefully retained leverage to higher interest rates during a period of low rates, we will attempt to manage a more normal interest rate risk profile as interest rate environment normalizes. The Fed's aggressive path for interest rates gives us the opportunity to protect NII at attractive levels. We have begun this process by adding $4.7 billion year-to-date of forward starting receive fixed swaps and $1.5 billion of spot-starting securities. This represents approximately 30% of the total hedging amount needed this cycle. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income decreased 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to reduced HR asset valuations as well as lower capital markets and card and ATM fees. Within capital markets, M&A advisory activity was muted by seasonality as well as the timing of transactions. Pipelines remain robust, but some deals have been pushed to later in the year. Additionally, debt and the real estate capital markets were impacted by uncertainty surrounding rates, geopolitical tensions and volatility in credit spreads. However, we are seeing some stabilization in the loan and fixed income markets and anticipate conditions will improve in coming quarters. Further, the reduction in real estate capital markets activity was offset by the addition of Sabal Capital Partners for the full quarter. Similar to the corporate fixed income market, refinance demand has been softer than expected in our agency, multifamily finance business as investors assess a significant move in interest rates. We continue to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of $90 million to $110 million, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. While we expect to be near the lower end of the range next quarter, we expect activity to pick up in the second half of the year. Card and ATM fees reflect seasonally lower interchange on both debit and credit cards, in addition, debit card fees were further impacted by fewer days in the quarter. Mortgage income remained relatively stable and included approximately $12 million in gains associated with previously repurchased Ginnie Mae loans sold during the quarter. While mortgage is anticipated to decline relative to 2021, it is still expected to remain a key contributor to fee revenue. Wealth management income also remained stable this quarter despite elevated market volatility. Service charges were also stable during the quarter despite seasonal declines in NSF and overdraft related fees. The first phase of previously announced NSF and overdraft policy changes were effective at the end of the first quarter, and the remaining changes will be implemented over the second and third quarters. These changes, when combined with the previously implemented changes are expected to result in full year 2022 service charges of approximately $600 million and full year 2023 service charges of approximately $575 million. We expect 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 4.5% to 5.5% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in net interest income. This growth includes the impact of lower PPP-related revenue and the anticipated impact of NSF and overdraft changes. So let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses decreased 4% in the quarter driven by lower salaries and benefits expense and professional and legal fees. Salaries and benefits decreased 5%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation despite higher payroll taxes and 401(k) expense. Salaries and benefits also include the favorable impact of lower HR asset valuations. Professional and legal fees decreased significantly as elevated fees associated with our bolt-on M&A activity in the fourth quarter did not repeat. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. As a result, our core expense base will grow. We expect 2022 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 3% to 4% compared to 2021. Importantly, this includes the full year impact of recent acquisitions as well as anticipated inflationary impacts. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage in 2022. Overall credit performance remained strong. Annualized net charge-offs increased 1 basis point to 21 basis points. Nonperforming loans continued to improve during the quarter and remain below pre-pandemic levels at just 37 basis points of total loans. Our allowance for credit losses decreased 12 basis points to 1.67% of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased 97 percentage points to 446%. The decline in the allowance reflects ongoing improvement in asset quality and continued resolution of pandemic issues, partially offset by loan growth and general economic volatility associated primarily with inflation and geopolitical unrest. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $36 million benefit to the provision. We expect credit losses to slowly begin to normalize in the back half of 2022 and currently expect full year net charge-offs to be in the 20 basis point to 30 basis point range. With respect to capital, we ended the quarter with our common equity Tier 1 ratio modestly lower at an estimated 9.4%, and we expect to maintain it near the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range. So wrapping up on the next slide are our updated 2022 expectations, which we've already addressed. I do want to point out that these expectations do not include any additional security purchases. So that certainly provides the opportunity for incremental benefit. In closing, as John mentioned, we began 2022 with great momentum. And despite geopolitical tensions and market uncertainty, we remain well positioned for growth as the economic recovery continues. Pre-tax, pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit risk is relatively benign. Capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, John. Good morning, David. I was hoping maybe you can talk about expectations for deposit growth, which came in better than expected and particularly as it pertains to the surge deposits. So maybe just how you're thinking about the trade-off between keeping some of these deposits and the potential for a higher beta? And I think, David, you highlighted potential for a $5 billion to $10 billion reduction. Can you maybe just clarify how much you expect for these to stick around and what it means for deposit growth? David Turner : Sure. So we were -- we had expected the $5 billion to $10 billion of deposits to start flowing out in the first quarter. We have maintained some pretty conservative deposit assumptions. But if you look at the growth and where it came from, it was in our consumer book. We continue to grow accounts and continue to be -- have a high level of primacy with our retail customers and so our deposit base is our competitive advantage, and it's been that way for a long time, and we're looking to leverage that as we get into this higher rate environment. As you think about the surge deposits, we have 1/3 of those that we think are going to be fairly similar to our legacy deposits in terms of beta, price insensitive then we have the other 1/3 on the other end, we think are much higher beta, 80% to 100% beta. Those are corporate deposits that are -- you could characterize those as non-operational deposits that are probably going to look for a better home or a higher rate as time goes by. We'll see what happens after this next rate increase, but we've expected that to either reprice or really flow out of the bank. And then you have in the middle, which is another 1/3 deposits that are stimulus-receiving deposits, small-business-type deposits. That one is a little harder to predict. We do have a higher beta on it, not as high as the second group. But any event, if we're wrong on the $5 billion to $10 billion, it's likely that we've maintained our deposits at a higher level. And over time, if we see that, then that gives us a little bit of comfort to be able to take some of our excess cash that we have, some $26 billion sitting on the balance sheet to deploy that into the securities book. But our guidance that we're giving you does not have that deployed intentionally. Ryan Nash : Got it. And if we could dig a little bit into the the new hedging program. So David, I don't know if Darren is in the room, I guess, you guys were the masters of adding swaps in a timely manner last cycle, and now you've begun this new program. So I think the market is having a little bit of trouble understanding why banks are adding swaps at this part of the cycle. And I think all of us understand. So can you maybe just talk about thoughts regarding locking in here, particularly using forward starters? And I think you talked about another 10 to 12 of additions. Can you maybe just talk about pacing and why this is the right decision at this point in the cycle for Regions? David Turner : I'll go ahead and start, and then [Darren] is here, I think he can add to it. But you hit on a key word, and that is forward starting. And so what we're trying to do is get our margin to the optimum level and then layer in protection for that margin over time. So if you look at where we put the first, call it, $4.7 billion in that's at a receive fixed rate of 2.32. Those are largely going to be effective for 2024. So we intentionally had them forward starting because we believe there is risk at that point in the cycle that actually rates could go the other way, and we want to be able to protect that. If we're wrong, then it happens to not reverse and go lower, then we haven't lost anything. We haven't given up any of our net interest income or margin at that point. These are all 5-year duration just like they were last cycle. And so when you do it forward starting, you can take advantage of pricing. They're not all that expensive to get into, and we're not giving up our asset sensitivity today. That's important. We are becoming and maintain our sensitivity. And if you -- on the comments just a minute ago, the way we're structured in the balance sheet is to benefit, in particular, at the back end such that our NII in the fourth quarter should be up 15% from the first quarter. And it's just the nature of how our sensitivity is structured at this point in time. [Darren], anything you want to add to that? Unidentified Company Representative : The only thing I would add is, David said it well, Page 8 of the deck just really shows the path of the net interest margin, which really underscores what David is saying. We're going to enjoy nice margin expansion as the Fed is tightening policy, but we have a very disciplined approach to manage that exposure as rates push higher. As David said, the probability of a downturn at some point if the Fed has to push higher increases over time. And so we want to be cognizant of that and as we get delivered those higher rates, put in that protection and really manage the downside risk in those out years. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Spahr with Wells Fargo. Christopher Spahr : Other banks seem to be spending their rate-driven incremental net interest income or at least some of it, whereas you've kept your 2022 cost guidance unchanged. So why do you think that is? And with this higher NII outlook, how confident are you that you can expand on your positive operating leverage this year, next year? David Turner : Well, kind of leveraging the comments just before, the way we structured the balance sheet, our NII will be growing nicely in the -- throughout the year but are really strong in the fourth quarter, which sets up a really strong 2023. We're still asset sensitive through that time period. And so we should have a nice tailwind in terms of revenue growth. We pride ourselves on being able to control our cost. We did a good job this quarter. There is that HR valuation asset that benefited us by $14 million. So you need to add that back to kind of get us level set.  But in any event, we continue to leverage our continuous improvement program to stay focused on how we get better every day and how we could leverage technology and process improvements so that we can keep our costs down because we are taking our savings and reinvesting those savings in things like digital, talent, continuing to hire people so that we can grow. We had mentioned that the vast majority of our growth in expenses this year are related to the 3 acquisitions that we closed in the fourth quarter of '21. So we've had a little bit of inflation we've had to deal with. And so we're continuing to work at all levels to try and keep our costs under control and generate positive operating leverage, which we believe we will have in 2022. We didn't have it this quarter, but we will when you get to -- when you look at the whole year and expect to have that going forward in '23. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : David, in slide deck, Slide 6, you give us the difference in the net interest margins based upon what's weighing down your margin today with the PPP loans and the excess cash. Can you share with us on the excess cash portion, where does the Fed funds rate need to go where you're not going to need to have that bullet point anymore because it will match your reported margin? David Turner : Well, it really gets back to the deposit expectations. So we've maintained this excess cash to be prepared to the extent the surge deposits do seek other alternatives, and we have to pay that out. Obviously, we're getting 100% beta on the cash while we wait, but being patient has benefited us. Putting that into the securities book earlier would have really cost us. And we did put a little bit of that to work this quarter. $1.5 billion of that at about 2.80% carry. If we were to do it today, it would be even higher. And so in the 3.5% range. So I think it's important for us to understand what the surge deposit flows are going to do relative to what the Fed rate movements are going to be. And I think over a fairly short period of time, our cash will get down to our normalized level, which is $1 billion to $2 billion. And then we won't have to have this disclosure. And of course, PPP will run off for the most part after this year, we won't have to talk about that one either. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, especially talking to you with your background as an accountant. Can you share with us your thoughts about AOCI? We all understand it's an accounting issue and it's only for the securities portfolio. Obviously, you, similar to your peers, had a big negative number this quarter, which took down tangible book value per share and book value per share, again, similar to your peers, so you're not standing out. But at what point does it become an issue for banks? And again, I know it doesn't go through your CET1 ratio like it does for the advanced approach banks. Do we have to ever get concerned about it if it keeps on -- the AOCI keeps on getting larger on the negative side? David Turner : So I'll try to answer this without getting upset. I think the -- I think that count on.... Gerard Cassidy : David, I didn't ask you about CECL. David Turner : So you've hit on 2 of them, 4 core accounting standards relative to what we're doing. But any event, we have to file a gap. So OCI does not -- the change in OCI relative to securities gains doesn't affect our thinking whatsoever. We manage the company based on regulatory -- our capital based on the regulatory rules in 4 category 4 banks like Regions and most of our peers. That's excluded from the regulatory calculation. Importantly, it's also excluded from the rating agencies. So they carve out the change in OCI relative to securities, not pension or other things, but securities they carve out. And what's frustrating about it is that nobody talks about measuring the fair value of our deposit base, which is where the cash came from to go by the securities. And so we're marking one element of a balance sheet through capital and that's just not how we manage the company. And so it's really irrelevant. It's done because it's easy to do. We can go get a quote. But the fair value of the deposits, in particular for Regions because of the primacy, because of the granularity, the fair value of our deposits are shooting through the roof. You just don't see that manifest itself on the balance sheet. You will see it manifest itself in growing NII and net interest margin. This is the time period we've been waiting for rates to rise. So the fact that OCI is working against tangible book value, we could care less. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is a follow-up to Ryan's questioning. The way you wrote out Slide 14, it seems like that your NII guide includes both a $5 billion to $10 billion potential accretion of deposits and 70% beta. I guess I'm asking if that's -- if I'm reading that correctly, isn't it -- should it be one or the other? In other words, if they stick around, it might have a 70% beta. Does that make sense? David Turner : Yes. Yes. Don't duplicate that. The $5 billion to $10 billion is baked into the $70 billion. So if we're wrong, our beta will be lower thus far, as I mentioned on Ryan's question, we thought deposits, these particular $5 billion to $10 billion worth of deposits would start flowing out in the first quarter, they did not. We still think that's going to happen. Perhaps it's just delayed a little bit, waiting for the next move, which we believe is going to be 50 basis points, by the way, in May. And we think those with are largely corporate non-operational deposits are going to seek a higher return than we're willing to pay. And they're probably going to move off the balance sheet in that case. So this really doesn't -- this is not going to be a big deal to us. We've been planning for it all along. Erika Najarian : Got it. And as we think about your NII guide, David, what type of earning asset growth should we assume? Again, it goes back to the deposit question, right, because your outlook has felt very conservative since you first put it out. But what interest asset growth range should we assume lies underneath this NII guide? David Turner : Yes. So you have to take the pieces and look at it. So there's not an appreciable change there. We've got 2 things working. One, we ought to have pretty good loan growth, as we mentioned, ex PPP and runoff portfolios, that's 9% to 10% growth in the loan balances. But then we've got the $5 billion to $10 billion of deposits going the other way, and so the cash will come down. So it's not as much of an earning asset change as it mix and what to carry what the yield is on the net assets that we -- the earning assets that we do have. And so we should see our margin continuing to increase. We're trying to give you the guide by telling you that by the time we get to the fourth quarter, our NII is 15% higher than where we are today kind of cutting to the chase because there's a lot of moving parts there. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : I wanted to ask about EnerBank. The economic environment has changed quite a bit since you guys acquired them. And I was wondering, have your views changed at all with regards to the loan outlook for EnerBank or any consideration may be further tightening the underwriting standards given a much higher rate environment. David Turner : No. We're very bullish on EnerBank. We're excited about the fact that we closed that in the fourth quarter. If you look at our growth of EnerBank, this quarter it was 2%. Obviously, if you annualize that it's 8%, which is below the guide that we gave you and the big driver there is seasonality. So it's the -- this first quarter is a low watermark for them. You'll see that pick up. This is a prime book. We're really excited about the carry that we can get there and the margin. We are ahead of schedule on where we thought we would be. And so, Peter, absolutely not. We are looking to that to be a good component of our growth. And again, we feel good about the credit quality, in particular, being paid for the risk that we're taking and a nice return for our shareholders on the capital deployed in that book. Peter Winter : Got it. And then if I could just ask about the capital management strategies going forward just between bolt-on acquisitions which have really increased profitability versus buybacks. I saw yesterday, you've got the $2.5 billion buyback. The question is how aggressive will you be? Or is it just being opportunistic and just want to have that authorization in place? David Turner : Sure. So let's go back through how we think about capital deployment. First and foremost, our capital is there for organic growth, it is to support our business. As I mentioned, ex PPP and runoff, we got loans growing 9% to 10%. That's where we want our capital to go first and foremost. The second is we want to make sure we pay an appropriate dividend to our shareholders. Our guide is 35% to 45% of earnings in the form of a dividend. So as earnings grow so will the dividend. We then think about nonbank acquisitions and the 3 we closed in the fourth quarter are great examples. We have a whole team continuing to look and work with our 3 business segment leaders on how we can provide products and services that we don't have to our customers. So we'll continue to do that. And then we use share repurchases as the mechanism to maintain capital at the optimum level and that optimum level is informed by things like CCAR and how we think about risk in our book. Of course, we just filed our CCAR submission in April. We'll hear back end of June on that. And yes, we did ask the Board and received approval for a $2.5 billion share repurchase program over the next couple of years. The control factor there, Peter, is CET1 that needs to be in the range of 9.25% to 9.75%. That's what our risk profile tells us we need to have CET1 in that range. We're targeting the middle of it at 9.5%. And so we won't buy shares back if it takes us outside of our operating range even if the price were right, which is where you're going opportunistically. I think that's just to help us manage our capital at the optimum level because that informs the denominator of our return on capital calculation, which we think is critically important to our shareholders. Peter Winter : Great. Really helpful. And just 1 housekeeping. Just how much was the credit interest recovery this quarter in net interest income? David Turner : I didn't commit that to memory. Hold on just a minute, I'll tell you. It's at the bottom of page. Which is the slide? John Turner : No, that's not the number he's asking. David Turner : Peter, we'll get that to you. You're talking about the impact to NII, right? Interest recovery in NII. Peter Winter : Yes. David Turner : We'll look -- somebody look that up. We'll get to you in a minute. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor : You did mention earlier about some consideration in your reserves for inflation. And I do want to ask, you always talk about your average account size being a bit smaller than some of your peers. And I guess, logic would have it that that customer base might be a little more impacted by inflation, by rising energy gas prices? And just wondering what you're seeing on some of those, call it, leading indicators. It would be helpful. John Turner : Yes, Matt, this is John. I would just say, so far, not a lot of change. Generally speaking, our customer base, as we look at deposit balances and the impact of COVID and relief dollars on customer deposit balances, we saw, on average, even in the lowest balance segment, about a 30% increase in -- 30% to 40% increase in pre-pandemic deposit balances, and we are still seeing customers maintain that level of excess liquidity as evidenced by the fact that our deposit balances actually grew quarter-over-quarter. We do are aware of the impact of inflation or the likely impact of inflation on our customer base. It is a more mass market customer base, as we've talked about before, 60% of our consumer deposit customers are in the mass market. So there will be some impact, and we're certainly watching for that, but we haven't seen it yet. Matt O'Connor : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess on the other side of the loan book and the commercial side, you had a big drop in nonperforming loans, big drop in the criticized assets. Was that anything specific like a couple of borrowers or sectors or? It has been improving for some time, but it's gotten quite low. John Turner : Yes. No, I think it's broad-based, and we continue to see improvement in credit quality across the book, a reduction in criticized loans, classified loans and nonperforming assets. And I think it reflects the work that our teams have continued to do working with our customers closely to evaluate the risk in our portfolios to exit certain relationships, portfolios and businesses where we feel like that we are -- see increased amounts of risk, we're not getting an appropriate return. If I had to point to any business where our businesses, portfolios where we saw improvement it would be restaurant as we continue to work out of that portfolio and hotel as the economy recovers through the pandemic. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a follow-up on the fee side. Now that you're getting close to the implementation of your changes to the deposit products. And you're continuing to reiterate your service charges expectations for '22 and '23, service charge is actually probably better than people expected in the first quarter. So I just wanted to kind of get your updated views on your confidence that you've got the right outlook and as you start to put the products in place, like what are your early takeaways from the continuation of that view? David Turner : Yes. So our service charges were a little better than anticipated. I will say that we put in some changes at the end of the first quarter, you'll see more change coming in the second and third. So it's too early to change our guidance that we gave you last quarter. We reiterated it this quarter, which was $600 million for service charges in '22 and $575 million in the next year. As we go through and see what the impact is for these changes, we'll update that, whichever way it might go. And we'll probably have a better feel for the year 2022 next earnings call. But right now, it's probably too early to change. Ken Usdin : Yes. Understood. Okay. And then one just follow-up on credit. To follow up on Matt's question about your provisioning thoughts. But can you just talk about, as you talked about normalization of losses starting to happen towards the back half of the year, what parts of the portfolio are you expecting to see charge-offs increase in first? And what areas are you just noticing that potential change in terms of delinquencies and loss rates David Turner : Well, I think that we lowered our range 20 basis points to 30 basis points. As we think about risk going forward, there's certainly the consumer -- on the consumer side of the house, there's been a lot of stimulus money. I think we feel pretty good about the consumer, but that's an area we need to watch closely to see what that starts to move first. The second piece of that would be small business. I think small business is an area that probably has, on a relative basis, incremental risk. The issue is we're just not seeing any of that right now. John had mentioned all of our asset quality indicators are getting better. We believe our normalized loss rate is likely to be lower than our history because of our derisking that we just mentioned in our whole credit book. So we feel pretty good about that. I think the leverage book, we want to watch closely as well as we see rates increasing and what kind of pressure might that put on the leverage portfolios. So those would be 2 or 3 that we watch. I do want to get back, Peter, you asked about the recovery that was an NII. It's $4 million this quarter. I want to close that out. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the expense side, I want to see if I can kind of ask the opposite of Chris Spahr's question earlier. Wondering what type of expense flexibility you may have if the revenue backdrop comes in weaker than expected this year? And do you still think that you're implying about 150 basis points of positive operating leverage in your guidance. Is that sustainable if the revenue backdrop gets tougher? David Turner : Well, so you saw a pretty good quarter this quarter, again, make sure you add back the $14 million on the HR to get level set there. The reason we were down is because our revenue was down in certain areas like capital markets that has a tendency to be more variable in terms of the cost relative to the revenue. Things like M&A. If you don't have M&A transactions and you don't have the compensation that goes with the deal. So it depends where the revenue challenges come from, John. If we're seeing it in places like that, then we should have lower compensation mortgage. If we don't have the mortgage production that we think then you're going to see lower compensation for that as well. So we do have some mechanism to take care of revenue if it's lower than we thought. Now a big driver of our change in -- we've changed, I guess, 2 times now, our revenue outlook has been because of the rate environment and just more carry there. So if we have if we don't get the rate increases, the forwards implied at March 31, which is what's baked into our guidance, then we're probably going to have lower incentive compensation. So there are puts and takes there. We still feel confident with the operating leverage number that you just mentioned. That's exactly what's baked into our guidance. And we will -- we are committed to having operating leverage over time. John Pancari : Okay, David. That's helpful. And then on the loan side, as you look at the remainder of the year in terms of overall growth drivers, where do you see the strongest loan generation coming out of both on the commercial side and the consumer side. What are the biggest drivers of growth over the remainder of this year as you look at the economic backdrop? John Turner : John, this is John Turner. Our growth in the last quarter, and frankly, over the last, I guess, 2 or 3 quarters has been broad-based across all 3 segments. So we're experiencing growth in our corporate banking business, our middle market commercial business and our real estate business. We're seeing customers access lines of credit and increasing rates to both rebuild inventories and to adjust to increasing costs associated with inventory. So obviously, increases in line utilization or both inventory and cost driven. We're also seeing some CapEx, which I'm excited about across a number of different industries. Customers are investing in expansion activities. Some of it is for modernization and recognition of a much tighter labor market. In Alabama, unemployment is 2.9%; in Georgia, it's 3.1%; Florida and Tennessee, it\u2019s 3.2%. So we're at full employment across some very good markets. As a result, customers are looking for ways to modernize and to continue to borrow. Growth in the portfolio. It's come in healthcare. It's come in transportation. It's come in our technology and defense sectors and asset-based lending. In the real estate business, we've seen some growth in homebuilder as markets are, again, continuing to expand as a result of consistent in migration of people, also seeing some growth in our real estate investment trust business, which has been an important portfolio for us in a really highly performing portfolio. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to grow through the balance of the year, and we expect that growth to be fairly broad-based. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had a couple of questions. One is I just want to make sure I understand how you are positioning yourself for the surge deposit activity that you outlined on Slide 5. I know you put the expected beta of 40% to 60% for the mid stable, mid-beta and 80% to 100% for the least stable, higher beta. Is that your indication to us of what you think it would take to retain these deposits? And would you go after them or are you saying, look, we think it would retain this and we're not going to go after them or it depends on how it progresses. Could you just give us some color on that? David Turner : I think if you look at the -- if you're on that Page 5, let's start with the right-hand side. Those are the higher beta 80% to 100%. I'd characterize those as non-operational corporate deposits. These are deposits that are parked here that probably are going to seek a better avenue, a better yield than we're willing to pay for. So you could expect those to most likely move off the balance sheet first. When you get to the middle which is at 40% to 60% beta, those are accounts that had stimulus or small business accounts with a disproportionate amount of cash in their accounts that we think will normalize over time. I think you'll see a little bit of both. You'll see some of that move off the balance sheet. You'll see some of that where we'll pay a higher price. But at the end of the day, we're going to have to monitor that. We have a deposit rate committee. This is what they do every month. They meet to try to figure out what we should pay. As you know, our deposit beta was among the lowest of the peer group, we expect that to be true going forward because of our granular, high-promising deposit base. So that one has that middle $13 billion is something we're going to have to watch closely to see whether it stays on. And if it does, what will it cost us? There is going to be an avenue for both of these, that is in the middle column and the right for off-balance sheet opportunities where we'll move those out of the bank, but we'll be able to have a fee associated with that. It will help compensate us a little bit. It won't cover what we're earning today or likely earning as rates move up. But nonetheless, it will be a bit of a carry for us going forward. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then since we're looking for 100 bps up in 2Q, right, in May and June, 50 bps each, we should start to see some of this surge deposit exit in 2Q, shouldn't we? Or do I have that wrong? David Turner : Yes. No, I think you're exactly right. I think, again, when it's 25 basis points, that may have been different. 50, pure large corporation that has non-operational deposits. You're going to be moving pretty quickly. So again, we expected the $5 billion to $10 billion that we talked about to move off in the first quarter, it did not. Now our corporate deposits were about flat on an average basis. We do expect that after this 50 basis points for that to start happening. So yes, you would expect deposits to be down in the second quarter as a result of that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just 2 other things. One is, what factors will drive you to shift your excess cash to securities? Are you going to be waiting to get through like 80% of the Fed funds rate hike to assess and then redeploy? Or are you going to be redeploying along the way? David Turner : Well, I think we've redeployed some. So we put $1.5 billion to work this last quarter. As spreads continue to actually gap out a bit, things like CMBS -- Agency CMBS was a good place for us. I guess we put at, what, 2.80 was $1.5 billion. If you were to do that today, it would be closer to 3.5. So it's kind of a little bit of a game we need to just watch and see what the rate environment will give us. We do have some cash we can put to work if our beta assumptions are better, then we'll have that much more cash to deploy over time. And our guidance we're giving you doesn't have that -- does not have that baked into the guidance. But using the spot securities and the forward starting swaps, all that's baked into our hedging strategy that we're trying to put in place so that we can protect a really nice margin that we think we can get to over time, and we've given you that guidance on one of our slides, on Slide 8. And I think in our pre-recorded message, we think we can push up to 3.75 with a 2.50 Fed funds. So that would be quite nice for us. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And last question is just on -- you had the AOCI hit. I know Gerard spoke about that with you earlier on the call. The long end of the curve, obviously, is up since March 31. So should we expect like for the DV01 hit in this quarter would be similar to last quarter for a like DV01 move? Or are some of these hedging strategies that you indicated earlier changing that? And I'm really asking what we need to take into consideration as we think through to 2Q with this rate back up what the AOCI hit could be. David Turner : So my first point would be to ignore it, and you don't have to do the math and you go on to something else. But if you want to track it for whatever reason that you have, I would expect it to probably negatively impact us, but not to the tune of what it did this past quarter, partially because of what we're lagging into right now. And frankly, the change in the long end isn't going to be as -- we don't think be as severe as it was this quarter. So good luck with your math. Betsy Graseck : Those hedging strategies you talked about earlier help you on that front, is that accurate statement or not? David Turner : Yes. That's right. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Following up on your response to Both Gerard and Betsy, I appreciate your comments around how it doesn't make any fundamental economic sense to mark securities to fair value on the left-hand side of your balance sheet without also marking the deposits to fair value on the right side. And so fundamentally, available for sale OCI hits are nothing more than accounting noise. But how would you respond to the idea that in the recession bank stocks are going to trade down to tangible book value. And so while it may not matter fundamentally, from a practical perspective, it's something that investors trying to care about David Turner : Yes. So this whole concept of tangible book value came about in the recession. To the extent we have a recession, the rate environment is actually going to go the other way and securities are going to be worth that much more. And so again, I think you -- if you want to mark the entire balance sheet to fair value, that would be reasonable, especially in trying times where you're trying to figure out what the true fair value of net assets are for a given company. But the total concept of tangible book value, in my opinion, is really not a going concern issue. It's a failure notion. It's, I'm going out of business, what I get as a shareholder if we liquidate everything? And the biggest issue I have with OCI is you're marking one element of the entire balance sheet. Securities, you're not market loans, you're not marketing deposits or anything else. So you're not getting a very good understanding of what true tangible book value is in any rate scenario. But I realize I'm in the minority and people just do -- are going to do what they want. But in a recession, and it actually goes the other way because the rates will be down. Bill Carcache : Understood. Yes, that makes sense. You guys have exhibited prowess in protecting your margins through the hedge program. I guess is there anything that could be ever considered wanting to protect that tangible book? Or maybe since it is a focus of investors may be introducing the concept of tangible book value ex available for sale might be something that people focus on because, I guess, with the passage of time, those open marks would not be realized if you held the securities to maturity? David Turner : Yes. I don't -- again, we don't use this to manage our bank at all. We don't use it for capital. We don't use it for rating agencies. So to put it in held to maturity where we don't have to have a mark, all that does is restrict our ability to manage the portfolio the way we want. And so, we don't see any need for that. We do realize there are some people for whatever reason that this is important. And all I'm saying is go calculate the fair value of our deposits, which will be in our 10-Q coming up and just add that in as you're thinking about tangible book value, then we at least have a better idea of what it is. John Turner : Thank you very much. I think that's all the questions we had. So thank you all for your time today. Thanks for your interest in Regions. Have a great weekend.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation\u2019s Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, we are very pleased with our quarterly results. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $558 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.59. And importantly, our second quarter adjusted pretax pre-provision income represents the Company\u2019s highest level on record. We continued to successfully execute our strategic plan and delivered strong results. Sentiment among our business customers today is cautiously optimistic. They\u2019re rebuilding inventories and looking for opportunities to expand their businesses. Loan commitments and pipelines remain strong and utilization rates continue to increase. The consumer remains healthy. Net population migration inflows into our markets remain robust, and the majority of our footprint has returned to equal or better than pre-pandemic employment levels. In fact, unemployment rates in 6 of our top 8 deposit markets are essentially at all-time lows. To date, broad segments of consumers still maintain substantial cushion in their deposit accounts. For example, consumers with less than $1,000 on average in their checking accounts prior to the pandemic are averaging a balance today that remains approximately 6 times higher than pre-pandemic levels. Overall asset quality remained strong during the quarter, with most metrics remaining substantially better than historical levels. However, we\u2019ll continue to closely monitor early warning indicators for any signs of deterioration. Our capital ratios remain strong. And in fact, earlier this week, our Board approved an 18% increase to our common stock dividend to $0.20 per share. We have a strong balance sheet deliberately positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. Investments we\u2019re making across our businesses are continuing to pay off. In the Corporate Bank, we continue to invest in talent, technology and strategic acquisitions to expand our products, capabilities and expertise. Excluding acquisitions, we have added over 200 new positions in the Corporate Bank since 2019, with approximately 85% in revenue generating or supporting roles. Our most recent acquisitions, Sabal Capital Partners and Clearsight Advisors are contributing to overall capital markets revenue growth in 2022. We\u2019re also strengthening our credit product capabilities for small businesses. Ascentium Capital is exceeding our expectations as a provider of essential equipment financing. We recently restructured our SBA organization and continue to invest in key talent to build out our non-restaurant franchise lending division, positioning Regions as a trusted resource for franchisees within our footprint. We\u2019ve been investing in our Treasury Management and Payments business for several years and are experiencing strong revenue growth. Today, we offer a comprehensive and competitive suite of solutions positioned to meet the complex needs of any client. We continue to invest in these businesses, rolling out new products and enhancements across our iTreasury platform, including real-time payments and fraud mitigation, as well as APIs and new cash flow analysis tools. Within the Consumer Bank, we continue to make advancements to become the premier lender to homeowners. In recent years, we\u2019ve expanded our mortgage loan origination team, upgraded our mortgage contact relationship management platform and continued to simplify the overall sales process. We also continue to invest in our mortgage servicing portfolio. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve completed bulk purchases for the rights to service of approximately $13 billion in mortgage loans. EnerBank, a leader in the prime and super-prime home improvement point-of-sale space, helps us meet customer needs while generating quality asset growth. Within Wealth Management, we continue to invest in talent and technology to optimize the client and associate experience. Since 2019, we\u2019ve added 44 new revenue-generating positions in our Wealth group, primarily in private wealth management and investment services. Last month, we launched our digital investing product, which combines the ease of a self-directed digital tool with the option of support from a financial advisor. These investments contributed to a strong performance in the first half of 2022. So wrapping up, we have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and a proven track record of successful execution. While sentiment across both, business and consumers remains generally positive, we will continue to monitor our portfolios for indicators of stress. We have a robust credit risk management framework and a disciplined dynamic approach to managing concentration risk, which has positioned us well to weather any economic environment and continue to deliver consistent sustainable long-term performance. Now David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let\u2019s start with the balance sheet. Average loans grew 3%, while ending loans grew 5% during the quarter. Average business loans increased 5%, reflecting broad-based growth across all businesses and industries. A majority of the growth this quarter was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and to expand their businesses. While still below pre-pandemic levels, commercial line utilization ended the quarter at approximately 44.4%, increasing 50 basis points over the prior quarter. Loan production also remained strong with linked quarter commitments up approximately $5.5 billion. Importantly, being into this commercial loan growth, we\u2019re maintaining a very high asset quality portfolio. In fact, balances considered investment-grade equivalent are up 30% compared to a year ago and approximately 44% of our total commitments are also considered investment-grade equivalent, representing its highest level on record. Similarly, our overall probability of default in this portfolio has improved approximately 35 basis points since mid-2019. Average consumer loans remained relatively stable, while ending loans increased 3%. Growth in average mortgage and other consumer was offset by declines in other categories. Within other consumer, EnerBank loans grew approximately 7% compared to the first quarter. As a reminder, EnerBank has a track record of well-controlled loss rates throughout multiple cycles, and primarily originates prime and super prime loans to homeowners who tend to be lower risk borrowers. Looking forward, we currently expect to hold total loans relatively stable over the remainder of the year, which would result in full year 2022 average loan growth of approximately 8% compared to 2021. This assumes a slowing rate of growth compared to the second quarter, but also assumes increased capital markets activity in the back half of the year. So, let\u2019s turn to deposits. Deposit balances acquired throughout the pandemic remained mostly stable early in the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle. Importantly, seasonal patterns related primarily to the income tax payments returned to those experienced prior to the pandemic. While average deposit balances grew, ending balances declined. Ending consumer deposits were mostly stable, while Corporate and Wealth Management balances decreased approximately $1 billion each. In addition to seasonal patterns and in line with our expectations, the declines also include certain commercial and wealth clients beginning to reduce some of their excess balances. We continue to expect a range of $5 billion to $10 billion of overall balance reduction for the full year of 2022, resulting from tightening monetary policy. The combination of our legacy deposit base, along with the more stable components of surge deposits, represents a significant opportunity for us as rates continue to increase. Let\u2019s shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income grew $93 million or 9% linked quarter, evidencing strong balance sheet growth and asset sensitivity in a rising interest rate environment. Cash averaged $22 billion during the quarter, and when combined with PPP, reduced second quarter\u2019s reported margin by 38 basis points. Our adjusted margin was 3.44%. The reduction in cash this quarter resulted mostly from strong asset growth, both loans and securities, as well as seasonal deposit outflows. Average loan balances grew $2.9 billion or 3% in the second quarter. Additionally, $1.2 billion of securities were added. The recent increase in rates have certainly validated our decision to wait on a better rate environment to deploy cash into securities. While not included in our current outlook, additional security purchases would provide incremental benefit. The primary driver of net interest income growth this quarter was higher interest rates and our decision to remain exposed to rates in the near term. Importantly, deposit balance and yield outperformance, including a 5% cycle-to-date deposit beta, allowed net interest income to grow by more than our previous guidance. Total net interest income is projected to increase 8% to 10% in the third quarter, as expectations for rate hikes have been pulled forward, so has our outlook for NII. Fourth quarter net interest income is now expected to be approximately 23% to 25% higher than our first quarter. Regions\u2019 balance sheet remains well positioned to benefit from continuing increases in interest rates. Incremental 25 basis-point increases in the Fed funds rate are projected to add between $40 million and $60 million over a full 12-month period as deposit betas are projected to increase into the 25% to 35% range. This NII benefit is supported by a large portion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash, which compares favorably to the industry overall. Over a longer horizon, a more normal interest rate environment or roughly a 2.5% to 3% Fed funds rate will support a net interest margin range of approximately 3.75% to 3.8%. This target incorporates the execution of recent hedging activity at higher rate levels than originally contemplated. While we have purposefully retained leverage to the higher interest rates during a period of low rates, we have begun to manage to a more normal interest rate risk profile as the interest rate environment normalizes. This includes the addition of $8.3 billion of forward starting received fixed swaps and a $1.2 billion of spot starting securities during the quarter. Through the first half of 2022, we have added $15 billion of swaps and securities. The swaps become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024, and have a term of generally three years. This represents approximately 75% of the total hedging amount expected this cycle. With a sizable amount of hedging complete, we will balance market rate levels and potential risk as we decide the appropriate time to finish the program. Now, let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 10% from the prior quarter, primarily due to improvement in capital markets and card and ATM fees. Within capital markets, growth was driven by higher fees and M&A advisory and real estate loan syndications, as well as a $20 million benefit from CVA and DVA. We continue to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of $90 million to $110 million, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. While we expect to be on the lower end of the range next quarter, we do anticipate activity will pick up in the coming quarters. Card and ATM fees reflect seasonally higher interchange on both debit and credit cards. Spend was up 3% year-over-year as inflation has impacted several categories, including a 30% increase in fuel, while discretionary categories such as retail goods, department stores and apparel are actually down. Mortgage and wealth management income remained relatively stable during the quarter despite unfavorable conditions. Seasonally higher mortgage production overcame first quarter gains associated with the sale of previously repurchased Ginnie Mae loans. While we anticipated a decline in mortgage income relative to 2021, mortgage, as well as wealth management, will remain key contributors to our overall fee revenue. Service charges declined during the quarter as seasonal increases were offset by NSF and overdraft policy changes. The second phase of previously announced NSF and overdraft policy changes were effective at the end of the second quarter and the remaining changes will be implemented in the third quarter. These changes, when combined with previously implemented changes, are expected to result in full year 2022 service charges of approximately $600 million. We also expect to implement a grace period feature sometime in 2023 and now expect full year 2023 service charges of approximately $550 million. We expect 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 7.5% to 8.5% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in net interest income. This growth includes the impact of lower PPP-related revenue and the anticipated impact of NSF and overdraft changes. Let\u2019s move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 5%, primarily due to annual merit increases, which became effective on April 1st, higher variable-based and incentive compensation associated with increased financial performance and better credit experience, as well as one additional workday in the quarter. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in payroll taxes and lower HR asset valuations. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. As a result, our core expense base will grow. We expect 2022 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5% compared to 2021. Importantly, this includes the full year impact of recent acquisitions, as well as anticipated inflationary impacts. With the changes in revenue and expense guidance, we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 3% in 2022. Overall, credit performance remained strong. Annualized net charge-offs decreased 4 basis points to 17 basis points. Nonperforming loans increased modestly during the quarter, but remained below pre-pandemic levels at 39 basis points of total loans, while business services criticized loans and total delinquencies continue to improve. Provision expense was $60 million this quarter and included a modest build to our allowance for credit losses, attributable primarily to strong loan growth and, to a limited degree, general macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as some early signs of normalization within select commercial sectors. Our allowance for credit loss ratio is 1.62% of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans remains very strong at 410%. Our annualized year-to-date net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points, given increasing expectations for a slowing economy, combined with inevitable normalization, we are maintaining our full year net charge-off expectations in the 20 to 30 basis-point range, but currently expect to be towards the lower end. Based on the recent stress test results, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement for the fourth quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023 is expected to remain at 2.5%, once our supervisory results are confirmed in August of 2022. We ended the quarter with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.2%, reflecting continued strong loan growth, particularly during the last week of the quarter. And while loan growth remains our top priority for capital deployment, we expect to manage to the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range over time. Also, as John mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.20 per share, an 18% increase over the prior quarter, which reflects strong earnings growth. So wrapping up on the next slide are our updated 2022 expectations, which we\u2019ve already addressed. In closing, we have delivered strong year-to-date performance despite volatile economic conditions. We will continue to be a source of stability to our customers, but also remain vigilant with respect to any indicators of potential market contraction. Pretax pre-provision income remains strong. Expenses are well controlled, credit risk is relatively benign and capital and liquidity are solid. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush. Peter Winter : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start off on the net interest income. Just based on the guidance, it looks like it\u2019s going to end the year about $1.26 billion. So, the question is, if the Fed were to stop raising rates at year-end, it seems like you have a lot of strong momentum for growth into next year. Could you just talk about some of the big picture trends that you see for next year? David Turner : Yes, sure. Peter, this is David. So, we do have an expectation that the Fed continues to raise rates probably finishing the year in a 3.25 to 3.50 range. And they could go past that. They could stay there for a while. We do believe there is risk that the economy slows to a point where they have to become more accommodative in the latter part of 2023 and 2024, hence, why you started to see us play some forward starting swaps in those positions to protect us to the extent that that happens. Clearly, rates could not come down, and they may stay flat or go even higher. But at that point, we\u2019re generating the kind of NIM that we talked about that\u2019s on our slide. I don\u2019t have the page number, but a very strong net interest margin and, more importantly, a very good return on tangible common equity profile. So, the benefit is through our deposit base. We think we\u2019re going to continue to have a lower beta through the cycle than our peers. It may be higher than last time for everybody. But nonetheless, we think that\u2019s our competitive advantage, even if the Fed stops at year-end without any further increases. Peter Winter : Got it. And then, just as a follow-up. Just could you give a little bit more color on the loan growth guidance in the second half of the year with it slowing? I\u2019m just surprised given the momentum on a period-end basis. David Turner : Sure. So one, we have to acknowledge we had pretty strong loan growth. I think the industry had pretty good loan growth in the first quarter. Obviously, things are slowing down a bit. We think we\u2019re going to have a lot of opportunity to grow. But this is when you need to be very cautious, very careful and make sure your client selectivity is robust and ensure that you get paid for the risk that you\u2019re taking. And so, we may be a little conservative in terms of our loan balances from here on out. What we wanted to make sure is we don\u2019t want to send the message that we\u2019re going to grow at the pace we just did in the first quarter. We don\u2019t think that would be appropriate for us. We still see good demand in a lot of sectors, financial services, utilities, wholesale durables, just to name, and elements of transportation are strong. And we think even in investor real estate, there are some places that we\u2019ve been able to grow in the multifamily sector, in particular, as well as in industrial area. So, I think it\u2019s a bit of a cautious tone is all we\u2019re sending. And we will grow as the market gives us permission with the right metrics. John Turner : Peter, this is John. The other thing I would add is that all the volatility has obviously created a disruption in the capital markets. And so, we\u2019ve seen particularly our larger customers rely on the pro rata bank market for funding. At some point, we expect a little more clarity about the path of the economy. And so, we believe that what is pent-up demand amongst issuers will -- they will begin to access the capital markets again, which will result in some pay-downs in some of the larger credit exposure that we have enjoyed over the last two or three quarters. So, that is part of our projection as well. Again, as David said, it may be a conservative point of view, but we believe it will happen at some point in the next few quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, David, just following up on your comment around the margin. I think you mentioned, if I heard you correctly, a 3.75 to 3.80 normalized margin for Regions. One, if you could tell us like what the Fed fund needs to get to in order for you to get to that level for the net interest margin. And once we get there based on the hedging strategy that you have, what you\u2019ve laid out, do you think that becomes something that\u2019s relatively stable, absent a big change in the rate backdrop and obviously the protection that you have on the downside? David Turner : Sure. So, if you look at our slide deck on page 8, we try to lay that out that gives you at least some parameters on where we think the margin could be in different scenarios. So, if the Fed is going to get close to 3% at the end of the day and stay there for a while, we think we can have a margin profile that\u2019s in that 3.80 range. And if the Fed doesn\u2019t move any further, it doesn\u2019t reverse course and come back the other way, that\u2019s probably where we\u2019ll be. If the Fed starts to come the other way, our margin will decline some, but we think we can protect. Today, we can protect about 3.60. As rates continue to move up and we finish our hedging program, we\u2019re about three quarters of the way through, we have another 25% to do. If we are patient enough, if we kind of understand where the economy is going, perhaps we can lock in a downside protection a bit higher than the 360. And that\u2019s really what our goal is, and we think 3.60 is a great level today. But can we get another few basis points on top of that if we\u2019re patient? We think so. Ebrahim Poonawala : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And I think just tied to that, you mentioned deposit betas versus the core customer base could be higher relative to the last cycle. Wondering if anything that you\u2019ve seen so far in the last two to four weeks that would imply that customers\u2019 conversations around higher rates have picked up and you could actually see a higher beta this cycle versus last. David Turner : Well, so the answer to that is no. We\u2019ve been a bit surprised, frankly, on both betas as well as balances for the industry. So, our cumulative beta thus far is 5%. We\u2019re one of the lowest peer group, I think, as the median is about double that. So, we keep calling for deposit balances to decline some $5 billion to $10 billion. I think the largest contributor to that would be corporate deposits that are going, we believe, in time, seek a higher return. We are starting to see that pick up a bit. Again, we\u2019re surprised that it hadn\u2019t moved quicker. But if Fed moved 75 basis points in the next move in September -- I\u2019m sorry, at the end of July, this month, and an expectation of another 50 in September, then we think those balances will start to move off balance sheet. And frankly, we\u2019re going to help facilitate that for our customers because we can earn a little bit of a fee on that and give them a better return today. That\u2019s happened some already. So if you look at corporate customers, they actually have either deposit balances with us or off balance sheet that we\u2019ve helped facilitate. And if you add those two together, actually a little higher than they were at year-end. So, we\u2019ve been pleased with our deposit base and our betas thus far. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : You\u2019ve all proven yourselves to be astute managers of risk. I\u2019d love to hear how you\u2019re thinking about the risk that the strength we continue to see in labor markets, and you mentioned the balances in consumer accounts and strong liquidity and spending in general. And to the extent to which all of that is in and of itself inflationary and could lead the Fed to have to do more, so everything seems great now, but we all know the hiking cycle works on a significant lag and we could see unemployment continue to rise well after the last Fed hike and we\u2019ve started to see initial claims keep up a little bit. So maybe if you could just reinforce how that dynamic, even though you\u2019re not seeing it at the micro level yet, perhaps how that -- if that all impacts the actions that you\u2019re taking today across the business. David Turner : Yes. Bill, it\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s one we challenge ourselves with constantly, as a team. In our discussions with others in the industry, including our regulatory supervisors than the Fed, in particular, about where they really want to go, I think we all believe there\u2019s an expectation of getting to \u201cneutral\u201d as fast as they can is what they would like to do. But I think every time there\u2019s a move, there\u2019s a need to pause and see what impact that\u2019s going to have on the economy. We do have inflation that can get addressed by slowing the economy down, which is taking effect now. But as much as they want to get to \u201cneutral\u201d, I don\u2019t think the Fed wants to direct the economy either. So what we\u2019re trying to do is read all the tea leaves, look at all the data that we can, study our customers, whether it be consumers or corporate customers to try and get an understanding of what they\u2019re thinking, how their business is, how they\u2019re managing their personal money, to gather an understanding of the slowdown in the economy and what the Fed may or may not do. We believe that the Fed is going to get to 325 to 350 by the end of the year. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll move exactly like the market thinks, but we think that\u2019s going to be a place where they\u2019d likely stop and let things play out over time. But, we have to be prepared for them to keep going. And if that\u2019s the case because inflation is not under control, there could be some ramifications to that long term, which is while we\u2019re cautious on extending credit, while we want to manage our bank as efficiently as we can, because you have to have scenarios for anything that could possibly happen as we seek to continue to have appropriate returns on capital to our shareholders. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s great color, very helpful response. Thank you. If I may follow up on EnerBank, can you remind us how growth math dynamics impact EnerBank? What\u2019s the interplay between the need to build reserves on the strong loan growth that you\u2019re seeing versus the timing of the revenue benefits? And then more broadly, if you could also speak to the trajectory of the reserve rate from here. David Turner : Okay. I\u2019ll start on EnerBank. So, EnerBank, we said represented 1% of an industry that was about $175 billion. So call that $1.7 billion of annual production for them. That generates growth in the double digits. We\u2019ve seen that play out. We don\u2019t think about the provisioning getting ahead of earnings because if we did that, we would not make any loans ever. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a terrible standard, but I won\u2019t go into that. It is what it is. So, what we want to do is be there for our clients to extend credit, regardless of the fact that we have to set up a reserve in advance. So, it doesn\u2019t come into play. We\u2019ve had nice growth with EnerBank. We\u2019re very excited about that, getting paid for the risk we\u2019re taking, and it\u2019s worked exactly like we thought it would be. John Turner : You asked about the growth math component of our return is fee versus interest income, how does that -- what was his question? David Turner : Well, primarily -- you\u2019ve got carry, you\u2019ve got -- net interest income is the biggest driver of our profitability there. And it comes in two fronts. It comes from the customer paying a certain rate and there\u2019s a discount from the vendor that\u2019s providing the service to the customer, an HVAC contractor for instance. We take those two pieces, and that\u2019s our yield adjustment. That should average in the 9% range over time. And that\u2019s the primary profitability that you\u2019ll see from EnerBank. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful. And the broader trajectory of the reserve rate from here that we should be thinking about? David Turner : Yes. So, we set the reserves under CECL based on the economic forecast at each quarter end. We have to look out through the life of the loan to do that. We have a reserve of 1.62%. We think it\u2019s very robust. And based on the risk that we see in the portfolio, we feel very good about that. The biggest driver of the increase in our reserve this quarter by far was loan growth. And so, we aren\u2019t seeing broad-based deterioration in credit at all. As a matter of fact, we think it\u2019s actually pretty good. We did have an increase in NPLs, primarily attributable to one particular customer. But overall, we feel really good about credit. We do think there\u2019s going to be some normalization. I mean, we\u2019re at 17 basis points of charge-offs this quarter. That\u2019s lower than \u201cnormal\u201d. And we think over time, it will get back to normal. I don\u2019t know that it will get there in 2022. We\u2019re forecasting charge-offs in the range of 20 to 30 basis points, and actually towards the lower end of that. 2023, you could see losses pick up as the economy slows as certain industries start to struggle a bit more than others. And I think you\u2019ll see it manifest itself first in really small businesses that will have bigger challenges than a larger business and certain consumer groups might struggle more than others. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : David, can you elaborate a little further on your comments about the capital market fees that you expect to be at the lower end of the range? I think you said in your prepared comments in the upcoming quarter. What type of capital markets environment are you contemplating for that kind of guidance? Is it currently what we just had this quarter, or is it an improvement? And then, within the capital markets, obviously, you guys are ECM players. Where are you seeing or do you think you\u2019re going to see the strength in the upcoming quarters? David Turner : Yes. I think that -- so we were -- if you cut out the CVA, DVA, we\u2019re kind of at the lower end of the range. We think that that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019ll be here at least in the short term. Capital markets activity is not as robust. I think you\u2019ve seen that play out across the board, in particular, in the money center banks that have more ECM. Obviously, we don\u2019t have that. M&A, advisory and loan syndications are the places where we think can continue to be robust for us. And I wish we were going to be at the upper end of that range. We\u2019ve had to revise that down from the beginning of the year a couple of times. So, we think that\u2019s a pretty good -- really good place to be. Real estate capital markets and leveraging our Sabal Capital Partners that we bought at the end of last year, I think, is helping us. But I think we would be remiss to if we didn\u2019t say that\u2019s going to be a little more challenging than we would have hoped just because the capital markets aren\u2019t quite where we all would like them to be at this point. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up question to your comments about the lending, the strength of your lending and how you recognize, and you guys are very well experienced in handling problems that from the downturn in \u201808, \u201809. So, nobody expects you to make any errors like that. But can you share with us -- I think you used the word robust in client selection. What are you doing if we are at an end of the cycle in the economy? And that\u2019s debatable, of course. But when you see the growth, not just for you but for the industry, everybody is showing good loan growth toward the end of maybe economic expansion, how can you reassure us that you guys got metrics in place that you just won\u2019t really have the problems that the other banks may run into? John Turner : Yes. Gerard, this is John. We learned a lot from the \u201809/\u201910 sort of time frame, and particularly the importance of balance and diversity. These are good times, but you can make your worst loans in the best of times. And so, we\u2019re being very thoughtful about what we\u2019re putting on the books. 83% of our new production was to existing customers. We\u2019ve been working very closely with those customers, particularly over the last 2.5 years as we work through the pandemic. I think we have a really good sense of what\u2019s going on in their businesses. We have been focused, as you know, for a number of years on recycling capital on risk-adjusted returns. We\u2019ve been exiting certain portfolios and relationships that didn\u2019t generate an appropriate return on capital for us. I think that\u2019s great. Discipline that exists within the company; we have strong metrics and key performance indicators built around all of our businesses; and again, really a dedication to a strong concentration methodology to ensure that we have good balance and diversity. We assume a variety of different scenarios when stress testing credits and stress testing portfolios. And as a result, we feel good about -- really good about the credit risk management culture that we have developed over time and think that our portfolios will perform well no matter what the economic conditions or how the economic conditions evolve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : David, you talked about the $5 billion to $10 billion of potential deposit outflows starting to pick up. And if we were to assume they exit over the next quarter or so, can you maybe just talk about your expectations for deposit growth? And given John\u2019s comments regarding what you guys think about loan growth in the second half, how do you think about the trade-off between growing deposits versus optimizing the mix and the cost of deposits? David Turner : So, the first part of that, we do expect, as I mentioned earlier, those excess deposits from our corporate clients to seek a better higher-yielding home. We also have about $1.8 billion in brokered deposits that we picked up from the EnerBank transaction. So, I think that we\u2019re always looking for quality relationships, deposit relationships, treasury management relationships. We were able to grow that 14% this quarter in treasury management. So, we\u2019re excited about that. And I think that from a consumer standpoint, we\u2019re in a good part of the country where we ought to see better migration of people into our footprint and take it -- and we should be able to take advantage of that. So, we should be able to continue to grow core checking accounts. We do have, obviously, inflationary pressures on consumers. I think we put in our slide deck that we\u2019ve even looked at --segmented our deposit base. On the consumer side, those that had $1,000 or less in their checking account pre-pandemic have 6 times more cash in their account today than pre-pandemic. Now, that\u2019s going to start declining if inflation continues at a faster clip. But continuing to grow customers ought to help us maintain pretty solid deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is among the lowest in the peer group at 67% change, maybe close to 68%. And so, we\u2019re optimizing our deposit book. We\u2019re growing deposits. It\u2019s foundational to how we make money. And so, we aren\u2019t even remotely close to having to worry about wholesale funding. There are some of our peers that had to dip into that because of the loan to deposit ratio. But this is where Regions shines. This is our competitive advantage is our deposit base. And we\u2019re looking to continue to grow that and grow customers and take care of our customers along the way. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then second, David, you\u2019re targeting 300 basis points of positive operating leverage, and I know it\u2019s early to think about 2023, but maybe just to follow up on Peter\u2019s question from earlier. If you think about just reaching the NII run rate and assuming no further growth, that would give you about 8% revenue growth into next year. So, how do you think about investing, and this obviously is a tricky environment with the potential for an economic slowdown, but do you expect that we could potentially see accelerating positive operating leverage in that type of environment? David Turner : Well, I think you answered that question upfront. It\u2019s a little early to get into 2023. But, let me help you here. We have a continuous improvement program where we are constantly focusing on how to get better at what we do. We had a pretty strong efficiency ratio this quarter of, call it, 54% on an adjusted basis. We\u2019d like that to be lower. We\u2019re substantially below the median, which is 400 basis points higher than we are. And I think that at the end of the day, if we could get closer to 50%, that would be great. And we\u2019re going to figure out how to try and do that. We cannot count on revenue growth just being the only driver of how we continue to be efficient. So, if we stay focused on that, Ryan, I think we can generate pretty solid positive operating leverage. Now, there\u2019s a caveat. We have to continue to take our winnings, if you will, and reinvest those in our company to grow. That means we have to reinvest in talent, we have to reinvest in technology, we will reinvest in our transformation we\u2019re going to go through on the deposit side, primarily, in other areas, and we do that while continuing to control our cost increases, which I told you earlier in the year, the vast majority of our increase earlier in the year was really related to acquisitions. So, we\u2019ve been good expense managers, and I think you\u2019ll see that continue into 2023. Ryan Nash : Got it. I\u2019ll make sure we hold you to that 50%. Thanks, David. David Turner : Okay. Target. Target. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Good morning. And Dana, great job on slide 8, by the way. David, I wanted to go back to slide 8. Can you [Technical Difficulty] what your plans are for security book, your cash balances from here? Obviously, if IOER continues to be full to Fed funds, your cash is going to be working a lot harder by the end of the year. David Turner : Yes. So I\u2019m glad you pointed that out. So that\u2019s a 100% beta on that opportunity there. We\u2019re at 1.65% on reserves. We\u2019ve been patient with our cash. We didn\u2019t need to put it in the securities book to help NII. We had the benefit of our hedging program doing that for us. So, we have been patient. We\u2019re glad we have. We put a little bit to work in the securities book because the spreads got to a point where it was -- we were paid for the duration that we were going to take, and that securities investment is really part of our hedging program as well. We were able to use our cash this quarter to fund all of our loan growth. I think, we\u2019re down to, call it, $18 billion of cash at the end of the quarter. And normally, that number is going to be $500 million to $2 billion worth of cash at the Fed. So, we\u2019ve got some of that that we need to hold on to for that deposit outflow that I just talked about, whether it\u2019s the corporate deposits or whether it\u2019s the EnerBank brokered deposits that will lead over time. And then, we don\u2019t have some for loan growth. So we don\u2019t see the need to tap into our alternative sources of funding, FHLB and the like, or certainly no bank debt issuances are necessary either at this time. So, we\u2019ve been cautious. It\u2019s paid off for us. I think we -- the securities we invested this quarter are yielding 330ish range. And as you can see that in the change in tangible common equity in terms of our decline was much lower than our peers. Erika Najarian : So, I just wanted to make sure we\u2019re taking away the right message here. From second quarter NIM, 3.06% can hit a net interest margin of 3.70% to 3.80%, right, from higher beta to base case at a Fed funds rate of 3%. And if the Fed starts cutting rates, your swap program has protected you to 3.60%. David Turner : That\u2019s correct. Erika Najarian : Okay. And my other question for you, David, is if we were to prepare for a [Technical Difficulty], how should we think about how more ACL build there may need to be from that 1.62%? David Turner : So you cut out on the first part of that, but I think your question was how do we see the reserve build from here from 1.62 in a mild recession? Erika Najarian : Yes, in a mild recession. David Turner : Yes. So, we\u2019re having to forecast out through life of loan today, which has elements of a slowdown already built into it. So, it really is dependent on how severe it is relative to our expectations already. And we kind of went through that, I guess, in the pandemic. You saw our adjustment quickly. Right now, we don\u2019t see that changing a lot because we think we\u2019re covered. And the real change to the allowance are just two things, whatever charge-offs have, reducing it and then the provision primarily for loan growth, which is what you saw this quarter. Our credit quality metrics are stable net-net, all in, and we feel good about where we are. But, if the economy starts to slip, then we\u2019re going to have to have higher provisioning going forward. And every quarter stands on its own. So, we\u2019ll have to reassess at the end of September. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just two quick closeouts here. Just one question, David, on the C&I loan yields, just not up as much, of course, as the NIM, and I\u2019m sure some of that is the hedging. Just wondering if you can kind of just help us understand how much of that is the hedging impact, how much of that might just be mix and pricing, et cetera? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. I would say most of that is related to hedging. Our old hedges that we had protecting us, those start to roll off. We have some still protecting us that are still in place. So we\u2019re not expanding it quite the pace that maybe others that didn\u2019t hedge are, but we still have pretty good loan yields net-net. And if you look at adjusted net interest income that\u2019s after charge-offs, we\u2019re one of the leaders in the peer group. So, that\u2019s a good indicator of telling us we\u2019re being paid for the credit risk that we\u2019re taking. Ken Usdin : Yes. Got it. Okay. And then, on capital, 9.2% CET1, you\u2019re mentioning you want to get back to the middle of the 9.25% to 9.75% net-net. And presuming that\u2019s to give room for loan growth, just wondering, obviously, that probably applies that no buybacks for now, can you just talk us through capital return expectations versus RWA? And then also just there\u2019s just a little bit more conservatism about the environment. David Turner : Yes. So, the reason we want to be in that range is to give us flexibility to make investments when we see opportunities. In this particular quarter, it was loan growth. So, we had really robust loan growth, and you could see our capital, our common equity Tier 1 declined. The primary use of that was, in fact, RWA growth through the loans. We\u2019re generating, call it, 50 basis points of common equity Tier 1 each quarter or at least we did this past quarter. We\u2019ll use a third of that to pay a dividend and then the rest of it is for investment. First off, it\u2019s for loan growth. We\u2019ve already sent the message that we don\u2019t expect loan growth at the pace we just saw in the first quarter. We think that will level off a bit. And therefore, we can accrete back from the 9.2% where we are, closer to the 9.5%. Probably can\u2019t get there at the end of the third quarter, take us into the fourth quarter. But, we use share repurchase as the last item to control our capital level. We think that 9.25%, 9.75% still is a great range for us based on the risk we see in our book taking into account all the macro factors that exist today. So you\u2019ll see us accrete back up towards that 9.50% before we get into share repurchases. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. One on securities book. I know we just had a bit of a chat on that. But, I wanted to understand what the kind of repricing speed is, duration, like how quickly should we be thinking about the back book migrating to the front book of 3.3 that you just talked about? David Turner : Well, if you look at all-in growth, so the 3.3 I just mentioned was an element of what we invested primarily as part of our hedging program. We did have other security purchases. So, all-in yield going on was about 3.13. That\u2019s replacing 2.23. So, we\u2019re picking up about 90 points on that. As we think about duration, we\u2019re looking at call it, right at five years today. And we don\u2019t think that extends a whole lot on us based on what we\u2019re buying. So, I think that got what you wanted, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Yes. So, like 20% roll rate annually? David Turner : That\u2019s right. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, on page 22 of the deck, you have your base R&S economic outlook. So, is this giving us the base case? And then you\u2019ve got a probability assigned to the base case, you\u2019ve got a probability to sign to the bull and the bear, and that\u2019s what\u2019s feeding into the CECL reserve analysis, or would you say this page 22 discloses your probability-weighted scenario? David Turner : Yes. So, we do ours a little different. We use a scenario, and as our CECL provisioning, we do run stress testing, obviously, using very different scenarios. But we don\u2019t probability weigh different things. So, what you\u2019re seeing here on \u201822 is the driver of our CECL provisioning. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Just a clarification. Do you -- David, do you expect your liquid assets to actually go down to $750 million? Because you\u2019re obviously much higher today. But is that realistic? David Turner : No, I was saying, hypothetically, in normal times, we could take those down, that cash down to a level much lower than the $18 billion that we\u2019re having -- that we have today. And that would be over time. So, we wouldn\u2019t seek to get there anytime soon. We want to maintain a lot of liquidity to take care of deposit flows because, remember, we had some $40 billion worth of growth in what we\u2019re calling surge deposits. And we\u2019ve made our best estimate as to how we think those things will behave over time, and we have about $13 billion, $14 billion of it that we think has either very high beta or it\u2019s going to seek a better alternative, which means we need to have the cash to pay for that if it starts to happen. But yes, in normal times, we could be down in that. I said somewhere between $500 million to $2 billion. And of course, then we\u2019d have the FHLB as our toggle to take care of other liquidity needs. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And one more, which commercial sectors are you seeing early signs of normalization? John Turner : From a credit risk standpoint, Vivek? Vivek Juneja : Yes. John Turner : I think, David talked about small business. We have some concern around the transportation, particularly on the lower end of the sector where you have transportation companies who are involved in less than truckload hauling and the impact of diesel fuel, inflationary cost, labor. We have been following office for some time and senior housing as well are portfolios that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. I wouldn\u2019t say in those two instances that we\u2019re seeing any normalization, but we do have a watchful eye on them. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thank you, David. Thanks, John. David Turner : Thank you. John Turner : Thank you. Well, I appreciate everybody\u2019s participation in today\u2019s call. Thanks for your interest in Regions. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Dana and the Investor Relations team. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions third quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A.  I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, Regions delivered another strong quarter underscoring our commitment to generating consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We generated earnings of $404 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.43. Our results include the resolution of a previously disclosed regulatory matter, the establishment of an incremental $20 million reserve for potential losses associated with Hurricane Ian and a strategic sale of $1.2 billion of unsecured consumer loans. Excluding the regulatory matter and other adjusted items, we once again generated record adjusted pretax pre-provision income. This quarter's results reflect strong revenue growth driven by higher rates, robust loan growth, low deposit cost and well-controlled operating expenses. Asset quality remains broadly stable with credit metrics in line to slightly better than pre-pandemic levels. In general, we feel good about the health of both our corporate and consumer customers. Many of our business customers have adopted operating models capable of thriving in uncertain operating environments and remain cautiously optimistic about opportunities to grow and expand their businesses. Consumers continue to maintain strong liquidity levels, and unemployment in our footprint remains at historical lows. This quarter's results are further evidence of the investments we made in talent, technology and strategic acquisitions continue to pay off. As expanded products, capabilities and expertise are helping us to meet customer needs and deepen relationships.  Before wrapping up, I want to take a moment to speak about Hurricane Ian. This was an incredibly powerful storm and communities in Florida and South Carolina all face difficult challenges as they began the recovery process. I'm extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of our customers, fellow associates and communities affected. Regions has a long history of helping communities through difficult times and will continue to support the recovery efforts. In closing, we have a strong balance sheet that is well positioned to perform in any economic environment. We have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and a proven track record of successful execution. While sentiment across both business and consumers remains generally positive, we will continue to monitor our portfolios for indicators of stress. We have robust credit and interest rate risk management frameworks and a disciplined and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk, which has positioned us well to continue to deliver consistent, sustainable long-term performance. Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans grew 4% while ending loans grew 1% during the quarter Ending loans reflect the impact of the strategic sale of $1.2 billion of consumer loans on the last day of the quarter and represents another example of our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Average business loans increased 5%, reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across all businesses and industries, specifically financial services, wholesale durables, transportation, information services and multifamily. Approximately 70% of the growth again this quarter was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses. Commercial line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately 43.1%, modestly lower versus the prior quarter. However, loan production remained strong with linked quarter commitments up $4.4 billion. Unfavorable capital market pricing continues to augment loan growth. However, we believe improved market conditions will eventually lead to clients refinancing off our balance sheet through the debt markets. Average consumer loans grew 3%, while ending loans declined 1%, driven primarily by the previously mentioned loan sale. Growth in average mortgage, credit card and other consumer was offset by declines in other categories. Within other consumer, EnerBank loans, which are primarily prime and super prime, grew 14% compared to the prior quarter. We expect full year 2022 average loan growth of approximately 9%. This assumes a slowing rate of growth compared to the third quarter. Let's turn to deposits. As expected, deposits continued to normalize in the quarter. Average total consumer balances were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter, largely consistent with typical pre-pandemic seasonal effects. Despite inflationary pressures, consumer balances have remained relatively stable, supported by wage increases and prudent spending.  Additionally, new customers and additional account acquisition remains healthy. Normalization has been more evident in average corporate and commercial deposits, which are down $2.9 billion quarter-over-quarter. However, overall liquidity managed by the corporate bank on- and off-balance sheet is relatively stable compared to year-end levels, reflecting the movement of some customer funds to off balance sheet treasury management options. The movement to these products and the remixing out of noninterest-bearing checking accounts into higher-yielding money market and savings accounts is as expected and is reflected in our overall deposit beta assumptions for this cycle. Ending balances have declined approximately $3.7 billion year-to-date, in line with our full year expectation for overall deposit reduction of between $5 billion and $10 billion. A rapidly rising rate environment is a significant competitive advantage for Regions, based on the combination of our legacy deposit base and the more resilient components of surge deposits. Let's shift to net interest income and margin. Reflecting our asset-sensitive profile, net interest income grew $154 million, or 14% quarter-over-quarter, while reported net interest margin increased 47 basis points to 3.53%. Our adjusted margin was 3.68%, reflecting the combined effects of average cash balances of $14 billion and PPP. The cycle to date deposit beta remains low at 9%, contributing to higher-than-anticipated net interest income growth. We expect full year deposit betas in the high teens. In addition to higher rates, growth in average loan balances provided further support for net interest income. Looking forward, while we do expect cash balances to continue to normalize, we do not anticipate accessing more expensive wholesale borrowing markets for multiple quarters. This, coupled with additional hedge maturities in the fourth quarter provides further runway for margin expansion. Total net interest income is projected to increase 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter and is now expected to be approximately 33% to 35% higher than the first quarter of 2022. Reported net interest margin is projected to surpass 3.80% in the fourth quarter. While we have purposefully retained leverage to higher interest rates during a period of low rates, our attention has shifted to normalizing our interest rate risk profile in today's uncertain environment. Through the first half of 2022, we added $15 billion of swaps and securities. The swaps become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and generally have a term of three years. This represents approximately 75% of the total hedging amount expected this cycle. As previously disclosed, hedging already completed will support a 3.60% margin floor even if rates move back to below 1%. We made some modest tactical changes to our profile in the third quarter, primarily extending some of our current protection. We still expect to execute an additional $5 billion of hedges and balanced market rate levels and risk to growth as we decide the appropriate time to finish the program.  Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income declined 5% from the prior quarter as a modest increase in wealth management was offset by declines in other categories. Service charges declined as the impact of policy enhancements implemented in mid-June, offset increases in other service charges, including treasury management. We expect to implement a grace period feature sometime in 2023. Overdraft policy changes made to date are expected to result in full year service charges of approximately $630 million in 2022. In 2023, after including the impact of a grace period feature, full year service charges are expected to be approximately $550 million. Within capital markets, activity was negatively impacted by the delay of M&A deals and higher rates in real estate capital markets. Results also include a positive $21 million CVA and DVA adjustment. We expect capital markets to generate fourth quarter revenue in the $80 million to $90 million range, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. Card and ATM fees declined quarter-over-quarter. Credit card income was negatively impacted by higher costs associated with the reward liability, while check card and ATM fees produced lower interchange due to a decline in both transaction volume and discretionary spending resulting from higher inflation. Elevated interest rates and seasonally lower production drove mortgage income lower during the quarter, but was partially offset by higher servicing income. Wealth management continues to perform well despite ongoing market volatility, and we expect this business to grow incrementally year-over-year. We also expect full year 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 11% to 12%, driven primarily by growth in net interest income, partially offset by lower PPP-related revenue and the impact of overdraft policy changes.  So, let's move on to noninterest expense. Reported professional and legal expenses reflect a charge related to the resolution of a previously announced regulatory matter. We do anticipate $50 million of this charge will be mitigated by insurance reimbursement proceeds, which we expect to receive in the fourth quarter. Excluding this and other adjusted items, adjusted noninterest expenses increased 4% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 3%, primarily due to an increase of 277 full-time equivalent associates as well as one additional day in the quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower variable base compensation and a decrease in payroll taxes. Over 70% of the increase in associate headcount are customer-facing within our three lines of business. We expect full year 2022 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5% compared to 2021. Importantly, this includes the full year impact of the acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of last year as well as inflationary impacts. With the changes in revenue and expense guidance, we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 6% in 2022. Although the consumer loan sale and hurricane-specific reserve creates some volatility in certain credit metrics this quarter, underlying credit performance remains broadly stable. Reported annualized net charge-offs increased 29 basis points. However, excluding the impact of the consumer loan sale, adjusted net charge-offs were in line with our expectations at 19 basis points, a 2 basis point increase over the prior quarter. We are seeing some deterioration in certain commercial segments that contributed to a quarter-over-quarter increase in nonperforming loans, but it is important to note that we remain below pre-pandemic levels. Provision expense was $135 million this quarter. The increase relative to the second quarter was due primarily to another quarter of strong growth in loans and commitments, normalizing credit from historically low levels and a $20 million reserve build for potential losses associated with Hurricane Ian. These increases were partially offset by a net provision benefit of $31 million associated with the consumer loan sale. Our allowance for credit loss ratio is up 1 basis point to 1.63% of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans remained strong at 311%. Our year-to-date adjusted net charge-off ratio is 19 basis points, and we now expect our full year 2022 adjusted net charge-off ratio to remain approximately 20 basis points. We ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.3% for solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued strong loan growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook, we plan to manage capital levels to the mid to upper end of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range over time. So in closing, we've delivered strong year-to-date performance despite volatile economic conditions. We will continue to be a source of stability to our customers and also being vigilant with respect to any indicators of potential market contraction. Pretax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity are solid.  With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe just to start out, I mean, obviously, revenue backdrop, NII looking pretty good heading into next year. Just give us a sense of how you're thinking about using some of these towards franchise investments? How we should think about expense growth going from here, both in terms of investments you're making, inflationary costs that you're seeing and just using a better revenue backdrop to actually invest in the franchise? David Turner : Yes, Ebrahim, this is David. So as you saw, we made some -- quite a bit of investment last year in the fourth quarter through three nonbank acquisitions. We continue to look for opportunities in all three lines of business to continue to grow our franchise. We have a lot of things going on. We have our new systems we're going to be putting in over time, and we'll see cost increases related to that. But we have our continuous improvement program that we continue to leverage to keep our total expense growth under control. We're not going to give you guidance for next year, but we do have a page in the deck that shows you what our compound annual growth rate has been very strong in managing and keeping our costs down. And we're going to continue to do that while making appropriate investments. We don't have anything specific. We're on the look for opportunities to help grow our three lines of business soon. Ebrahim Poonawala : And those, they were essentially tuck-in deals, be it fintech or fee kind of deals that you've done recently similar to those? David Turner : That's correct. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just one quick question on -- I mean, obviously, your hedging strategy is well understood. As we think about in a world where rates overshoot expectations relative to the forward curve, is there any risk to a potential drag to the margin at least in the short run where Fed is not cutting, but we actually see rates going much higher than what the forward cost pricing is. David Turner : Well, I think you have a couple of different things. Higher rates for our type of franchise is good for us. So to the extent we overshoot 4.5%, 5% of Fed funds, we'll benefit from that. Clearly, if it stays up there longer, you end up having some incremental credit risk because if rates are that high, that means inflation continues to be higher than the Fed wants, and they have to keep going. So there could be some incremental credit risk until you get to settle down from a rate increase standpoint. The reason we haven't completed our hedging program and the reason we have $13 billion of cash is partially wanting to -- I don't want to use hedge again, but part of trying to figure out where rates might go. So we have a bit of dry powder. That's about $5 billion that we have dry, not counting at 13 on the books to hedge, and we're looking for a better foothold. So we could be patient. Our NII is growing nicely without that. And I think in our material, we show you that we can protect a margin right now of 3.60 if rates were to go back to 1% or below. So being patient, I think, is the right thing for us to be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Just on the credit front, if you could get with a little more detail on the low or consumer loan sale in terms of the actual types of credits that were sold? And any remaining sales expected on that front? And if so, how are you thinking about the loss content on any remaining transactions on that side? David Turner : Sure, John. This is David. So we acquired EnerBank in the fourth quarter last year. It's an unsecured consumer portfolio. We told you at that time, we could grow that portfolio double digits. That industry was about $175 billion industry. So you're talking about $1.7 billion to $2 billion worth of production each year. But we also had this other unsecured consumer portfolio that we had built up over time that those loans were not being serviced by us or serviced by a third party. And we thought that the right thing to do from a capital allocation standpoint and a risk reduction standpoint would be to sell that portfolio as we continue to invest in growing our EnerBank book.  As you can see in the slides, we had reserved about $94 million. We ended up taking charge-offs of $63 million. So we had $31 million worth of provision benefit that's flowing through the financials this quarter. But it was really a capital allocation risk reduction measure. And we don't anticipate at this time having anything else. We don't have any other unsecured portfolios like that -- that's not true. We do have a small, and it's a runoff. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then definitely also on credit, sorry. But the -- can you give us a little more detail around the decrease in NPAs. I know you mentioned some commercial segments. So what commercial areas did you see that increase, anything indicative of a trend you see there? And then I know you mentioned that you're seeing some normalization in credit that influence your provisioning in what areas are you seeing that normalization? And could that interpret into higher charge-off expectations for '23, even though I know you're at 20 bps for 2022? John Turner : John, this is John. So we are seeing some stress in the office portfolio, particularly urban office, a reflection of some of the back-to-work changes that we're all seeing in the economy, consumer discretionary related kinds of businesses where consumers are choosing not to spend as freely as they had been. Some softness in not-for-profit healthcare related to rising labor costs and inflation, similarly in senior housing. Again, we're seeing, I would say, some impacts from both labor and inflationary costs and then some disruption in technology-related businesses. All that I'd characterize as the beginnings of what we would call normalization, we are at historically low levels in begin to normalize in 2023 and beyond, currently at 52 basis points of NPLs, still much better than pre-pandemic levels. The charge-offs, as you noted, 19 basis points for the quarter, we expect 20 for the year. We'll firm up our guidance for 2023 in late November or January. But our current projection is that charge-offs in '23 will be somewhere between 25 basis points and 35 basis points as we begin to see a return to more normal levels, again, of credit quality. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : If I could just focus in on the fee side. I see you're continuing to reiterate your '23 service fees guidance of $550 million. And just kind of take you through the recent settlement and the incremental changes that you're making and the confidence you have in continuing to reiterate that level of service fees for next year? John Turner : Yes. Ken, thank you for the question. I think what we're observing is customer patterns are very much what we expected when we made changes. So you might recall that we changed our posting order. We provided customers with alerts. We reduced the cap on daily overdraft fees. We eliminated charging for NSF. We eliminated charges for overdraft protection transfers. Most recently, we're giving customers access to their paycheck two days in advance. We also have implemented an overdraft protection line of credit to help customers. And in probably the second half of 2023, we'll also implement a grace period. All that is designed to help customers better manage their finances. And we're seeing a positive impact. It's not necessarily a trend, but I would say over the last quarter, we've seen about a 20% reduction in a number of customers who are overdrawing their account, which is, again, I think, a very positive thing. We've talked about historically how we've dealt with changes in fees. And I'd point to overdraft fees as an example. Since 2011, we've seen almost a 40% reduction in the collection of overdraft fees. And yet we overcame that and grew noninterest revenue over that same period of time of almost $500 million. So we have a history of continuing to evolve and change our business to overcome losses in fee revenues. We're doing that through growth in capital markets, growth in treasury management, growth in wealth management and in other parts of our business. And so we feel good about the impact to customers and believe that we can manage the impact to our business. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. Okay. And second follow-up, just in terms of wealth management really has bucked the market trend here, continuing to increase in a really tough market. Can you just talk about is that new customer wins and business adds? And is that more than overcome the natural market challenges? John Turner : Yes. It's a combination of a number of things. One, we have a very strong retail investment services business works very closely with our branch bankers and in this environment, we see a lot of customers who are interested in acquiring annuities. So we've seen nice growth in that source of fee revenue. Our institutional business is growing, and we've had some nice wins there. And then within wealth management, both opportunities to move new business, new customers, and we've additionally seen about 20% of our increase in fee revenue in the personal wealth management business as a result of customers moving money to us during this period of time where they're looking for more stability. Our approach to the business is as a fiduciary. And I think during uncertain and volatile times, customers are choosing to increase their level of business with us. So all those things are contributing to growth in wealth fee income. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is for David. David, you're implying an exit rate for NII of $1.375 billion in the midpoint of the range of your guide. And I'm wondering, as we think about that as a jumping off point, do you think that you can continue to grow that level of NII based on the forward curve in '23? David Turner : Yes. I mean I think we have -- as I mentioned earlier, we have some dry powder left. We still have $13 billion of cash. We don't have to access the wholesale market for several quarters based on our estimates. We have still a little bit of hedging to do. We did some slight repositioning this past quarter to help continue to grow NII and our resulting margin and really taking advantage of what could be a much higher rate environment. I would tell you our guidance is baked on a 75 basis point increase in November, followed by 50 basis point and then 25 basis points. If I had to -- if we had to do it all over again, we probably have that a little bit higher. So I think we have some incremental opportunities to grow, and our loan growth has been nice. We have a very solid balance sheet. We leverage our deposit franchise. And I think you can -- I think we're hitting a pretty good tailwind here, hopefully wrapping up the year strongly and really positioning '23 to be a pretty spectacular year as well. Again, we'll give you better guidance when we get to the earnings call in January. Erika Najarian : Got it. And then the follow-up. As we think about deposit trends, clearly, the rate curve implies the terminal rate over 100 basis points greater than we last -- spoken in this type of earnings context. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how do you -- you've been very active with regards to managing some of the search deposits. How do you think about deposit growth from fourth quarter? Do you think most of the surge deposits and that impact would have been driven out of the bank? And additionally, with a 9% cumulative beta in the third quarter, how should we think about terminal beta within the new Fed on rate or that the forward curve is implying? David Turner : Yes. So, we've been saying all along that we expected deposits to decline in the corporate space, in particular, the surge deposits of $5 billion to $10 billion. We're down about 4.5 since year-end -- since last year-end. And I think that we still expect that to happen. We're holding on to more than we thought. And so perhaps that's a positive to us. I think as you think about betas, so our beta last cycle was about 29%, right at 30%. We've been guiding that it's going to be higher, this go around to the mid to upper 30s. Our Q into beta now is at 9%. I think linked quarter we at 11%. This next quarter, you're going to see that move up a bit. We expect about a 30% beta in the fourth quarter, it will take our cumulative to mid-teens. And then in the first quarter, we're probably going to see even a higher beta than that, call it, 50%, which will get our cumulative to about 25 at that time. So, I think you're going to just continue to see this hike-up a bit. But we believe our beta as like last time will be lower than our peers, which is the value of our franchise, but call it, mid-30s to upper 30s. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : David, can we follow up on the credit side of it? Again, I know your levels of credit delinquencies and charge-offs are extremely low. But John, when you were talking about some of the commercial stuff, can you share with us just how large the syndicated loan portfolio is today as well as the leverage portfolio? And are there any signs that syndicated portfolio is showing signs of more weakness in your just in footprint portfolio? John Turner : Sure, Gerard. First of all, no would be the answer to the last question. And the syndicated portfolio represents about 25% of our overall portfolio. Interestingly, we've had a 27% increase in investment-grade balances over the last 12 months. And so, the investment grade portion of our overall portfolio is about 40% today. Over the last three years or so, we've seen the probability of default come down by 19 basis points. And in other words, the quality of our book continues to improve, we believe. Our leverage book as defined, about 3/4 is roughly $9.5 billion in total and about 86% of that is in the Shared National Credit exposure. So again, pretty high quality, we think, and we're not seeing any deterioration to speak of in that portfolio at all. David Turner : Gerard, this is David. We have a -- oftentimes they don't get to the back of our deck. But on Page 25, we have a lot of what John was speaking to. And it really shows the -- quite a bit of improvement in terms of probability of default and the investment grade improvement. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. And then following up on deposits. Obviously, as you pointed out, David, a few times on the call, strength of the franchises, the deposits, which is true for most banks prior to quantitative easing, of course. But what's striking is your Slide 19 that those medium customer deposit balances just remain so healthy. Have you guys dug into it? Is it -- I think you may have referenced about maybe higher paychecks on the consumer side that's keeping balances up? But what are you guys sensing from why these balances just don't seem to be really falling off just yet? David Turner : Yes. So, the consumer has been very resilient. In particular, this bucket that we have on [indiscernible], that group happened to -- that cohort happened to be the recipient of a lot of stimulus. They also were recipient of minimum wage increases. Our unemployment rate is below 4%. So these are people working and they're being prudent where they're spending. And so they just haven't -- they just have not spent more than they make. And I think it's attributable to what John just mentioned in terms of overdraft being down, too. I think people are being more cautious and careful in this period of time. And with inflation, you would expect this group to be hit more adversely but they also disproportionately benefited. So that's why you're seeing this on the surface, it doesn't make sense to you, but that's what the data is telling us. And we've gotten pretty granular with this group account by account by account, which is where we got the information from. Gerard Cassidy : And David, this group you're referring to, is this -- would you say a FICO score group of high 600s to low 700s? Or is that about right? David Turner : It's not just lower income, lower FICOs. It has to do with how people manage their money. So it's lower balances. So this customer segment was under $1,000. That could be people that have fine FICOs, they just spend about what they make. So they don't have a lot in their account. So it's not necessarily the lower FICO band. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Following up on your comments on Slide 19. Does the data tell you that the Fed is going to have to do more? Or does your interpretation of this suggest rather that consumers and businesses are just in a better position to weather the downturn? Curious to hear sort of just your interpretation of Slide 19. David Turner : The Fed doing more in terms of raising rates and slowing inflation or stimulus or what -- from what context are you talking about? Bill Carcache : Yes, the Fed doing more in the sense that it's this high level of liquidity and capacity to spend that is in and of itself fueling inflation and perhaps that could lead the Fed to do more from that perspective? David Turner : Well, we certainly think the Fed is getting after inflation. And as a result, we think their move is going to be pretty strong this next couple of moves at least. And -- but this customer segment is just -- they're just better -- some of our businesses, frankly, better prepared for whatever downturn or slowdown we might have. Our base case is not a recession, but we do think the probability of that has increased. And if the Fed moves at the pace we think, there's a strong likelihood that, that can happen, but we think it will be fairly mild. But we do think that customer spend patterns are down. We saw that in our debit card transactions this quarter, quarter-over-quarter, they were down. And so we think people are already being prudent with that. The inflation that we're seeing is coming from labor in a very tight labor market, it's hard to get on top of that unless unemployment rate goes up, some. So I think that's what will happen over time. And then other inflations have been driven by commodities, which is really a supply imbalance right now versus demand. But with the Fed moving at the pace that they're moving is going to slow that down. It's going to bring demand back to supply. And I think you'll see us -- the expectation is you would see a slowdown from that standpoint. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful. And the expectation of a mild recession to the extent that we have one is consistent with your reasonable and supportable outlook on Slide 23. But just for sensitivity purposes, could you give a sense of what kind of impact taking the unemployment, say, to 5% -- the 5% level would have on the reserve rate, for example? David Turner : Yes. I can give you some data points, but it's important to know that when you start picking on one particular item, there are a host of things that go into the calculation. So what you're asking for is everything else being stable except for unemployment going to 5% or 6%. So if you were to do -- and no other changes, no response from the bank, no anything, you would probably have a reserve that's 20% higher under a 6% unemployment. But again, you start taking into account what employment means we're interest rates. And so our NII is likely overwhelming whatever credit issues that we might bake in. So it's a nice thing to think through, but there are just too many parts that kind of figure out what the net-net is. We think higher rates for Regions is still a net positive. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful. And if I can, just for clarification, ask a final question on Slide 23. Sorry, just forgot what slide it was, but your overall commentary about protecting NIM in that the 3.6% range, I think it was Slide 20 in 2023 and beyond. How far beyond '23 does the protection extend? And would that protection still hold in an extreme where rates fall to take it to an extreme where if ZIRP were to return, does the protection still -- is the protection still in place? Or is it only up to a certain level of Fed funds? David Turner : Well, generally, when we put in hedges they're about three years in duration. So if you -- we're talking about the middle of '23 and '24 start. So you're three years out from that. So you're '26, '27 protection. And so we will look to extend those. We still have room to -- for more hedging and it's dynamic. We study this every single quarter. And we got a group that does it every day. And so this is just a static position that we're showing you as of the date we produce it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Stephen Scouten : I guess I wanted to ask, David, maybe to you first. What is it that makes you think these deposit betas will be higher this time around based on what you've seen so far? Is it really just a blending in of the surge deposits? Is it any sort of change in customer behavior? I just would think with all your liquidity, they would actually be a little bit lower based on what we've seen so far. David Turner : Well, I think one, we're coming from a zero. And we did have a lot of surge deposits, $40 billion for the surge deposits. We think that that's going to -- 1/3 of that's going to move out. We expected 5 to 10, hadn't happened yet. If we've missed it, we've been probably a little bit more conservative. We much rather give you a mid-30s than a 29 where we ended the last cycle. But I think expectations would be for everybody, it should be a bit higher. We're coming from a low and going to a higher rate environment that we saw last time as well. And so we kind of peaked last time pretty quickly and then started to come back down in I think '19 it was. So again, if we missed it, it's probably because we're a little conservative. Stephen Scouten : Okay. That's helpful. And then just you referenced the level of liquidity cash balances here a number of times that you still have. Securities have been down in the next couple -- for the last couple of quarters. Obviously, we saw some of those service deposits out and you referenced no more borrowings. So I'm just -- all those puts and takes there, I guess, how low could you see cash balances go? And do you think you'll have to continue to take securities lower to offset more of these potential outflows without borrowing? David Turner : Yes. We generally would run with $1 billion to $2 billion of cash. We've got to have $13 billion to really take care of the surge deposits that we're going that we expect to run out. And we've been a little bit opportunistic with not deploying our cash and securities, but we didn't need to because we had good loan growth and we had good hedging in protection. And so our NII was growing nicely. There was no reason for us to -- we could have generated more NII, but at the risk of missing an opportunity to invest that cash in a much better environment, which is what we're getting. So I think being patient here is important, and we really want to use that cash to fund our loan growth. More importantly, that's our first order of business versus trying to put it in the securities book at this point. If we see where we think rates may cap out, could we use our securities book for some incremental hedging? Yes, we can do that. But think about it as -- we still have a lot of access to borrow from FHLB. Our total liability cost right now, 23 basis points is the lowest in the peer group, and we don't see where we need to access wholesale anytime soon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor : Actually all of my questions have been answered. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Michael Rose : Just two quick questions. Just as it relates to Hurricane Ian, I think around 12% of your deposits are within some of the counties that got kind of hit historically, you've seen some deposit inflows from aid and things like that. Is there any sort of expectation that you have for potential deposit inflows? And is it material? David Turner : Michael, at this point, we don't -- there's still a lot of uncertainty this thing, Ian hit right here at the quarter end. We did our best, estimate trying to figure out what the damage was going to be. But you're rightly to point out that oftentimes in these storms, there's a lot of money that comes into it, Federal dollars, state dollars and insurance money. But we haven't really contemplated any of that, and our deposit guidance does not reflect any additional deposits coming from those sources. Michael Rose : Okay. Helpful. And then maybe -- I'm sorry if I missed this, but -- so the range for capital markets was moved a little bit down. As we think about going into next year, we're -- obviously, the backdrop is softening to some degree. Is that kind of the new range that we should kind of expect in the kind of the near to intermediate term for that business? David Turner : I wouldn't sign off on that just yet for next year. We'll give you better range when we get to the January earnings. That was really just more for this next quarter because of what we're seeing right now in particular with M&A and real estate capital markets. So don't lock that in for 2023. Michael Rose : Okay. I understand you're not going to give any sort of guidance and I totally get. What would be kind of the broader puts and takes in your eyes to be within the kind of the prior range or above it or below it, et cetera? David Turner : I think, if we can get M&A back on track to where it was, if we can get real estate capital markets to open up a bit, you just get more activity. The whole capital markets are kind of down right this minute. We're going to continue to add some bolt-on acquisitions or at least looking for opportunities. We had a couple that we added this past year. And so we're going to do some things to see if we can't help augment the pressure that we're feeling from the lack of having, again, M&A and real estate capital markets. John Turner : So just to be clear, we're not contemplating acquisitions in the quarter\u2026 David Turner : Yes. John Turner : \u2026answering to this question. John Turner : Okay. Well, that was the last question. Thank you all for your interest in our company. Appreciate you participating today. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation\u2019s Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. Earlier this morning, we reported full year earnings of $2.1 billion, reflecting record pretax pre-provision income of $3.1 billion, adjusted positive operating leverage of 7% and industry-leading returns on both average tangible common equity and total shareholder return. Our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work that\u2019s taken place over the past decade to position the Company to generate consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We have enhanced our credit, interest rate and operational risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. We made investments in markets, technology, talent and capabilities to diversify our revenue base and enhance our offerings to customers. For example, investments in our treasury management products and services led to record revenue this year. Similarly, our Wealth Management segment also generated record revenue despite volatile market conditions. And now we\u2019re seeing positive results of our comprehensive strategy. Over the course of the year, we grew revenue and average loans while prudently managing expenses, further illustrating the successful execution of our strategic plan. So, as we enter 2023, it is from a position of strength. Our business customers have strong balance sheets. They have benefited from population migration and many continue to carry more liquidity than in the past. Our consumer customer base remains healthy. Deposit balances remain strong and credit card payments remain elevated. The job market continues to be solid with approximately two open jobs available for each unemployed person across the Regions\u2019 footprint. We have a robust credit risk management framework, and a disciplined and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk. Our portfolios are more balanced and diverse than at any point in the past. We have a strong balance sheet that\u2019s well positioned to perform an array of economic conditions. We have solid capital and liquidity position to support balance sheet growth and strategic investments. And most importantly, we have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and a proven track record of successful execution. So as we look ahead, although there is uncertainty, we feel good about how we\u2019re positioned. Now, Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let\u2019s start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 1% sequentially or 9% year-over-year. Average business loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting high-quality broad-based growth. Average consumer loans declined 1% as growth in mortgage, Interbank and credit card was offset by the strategic sale of consumer loans late in the third quarter and continued runoff of exit portfolios. Looking forward, we expect 2023 ending loan growth of approximately 4%. From a deposit standpoint, as expected, deposits continued to normalize during the quarter, consistent with a rapidly rising rate environment. Average total consumer balances were modestly lower, primarily driven by higher balance customers seeking marginal investment alternatives. Meanwhile, the median consumer balance remains relatively stable, still about 50% above pre-pandemic levels. Normalization was more pronounced in average corporate and commercial deposits, which were down 2% during the quarter. As anticipated, our business clients continue to optimize the level and structure of their liquidity position. We experienced remixing away from noninterest-bearing deposits to other options, both on and off balance sheet, including those offered through our treasury management platform. Ending deposit balances have declined approximately $7 billion year-over-year, in line with our previously provided 2022 expectations. Looking forward, we do anticipate further deposit declines of approximately $3 billion to $5 billion in the first half of 2023, reflecting continued Federal Reserve balance sheet normalization, seasonal trends and late-cycle rate-seeking behavior. We expect to experience stabilization of deposit balances midyear with the potential for modest growth in the second half of the year. Our deliberate approach to managing liquidity allows for deposit normalization and growth in the balance sheet without the need for material wholesale borrowings in the near term. So, let\u2019s shift to net interest income and margin. Reflecting our asset-sensitive profile, net interest income grew to a record $1.4 billion this quarter, representing an 11% increase while reported net interest margin increased 46 basis points to 3.99%, its highest level in the last 15 years. While deposit repricing continues to accelerate, the cycle-to-date beta remains low at 14%. Importantly, our guidance for 2023 assumes a 35% full-cycle beta by year-end. There is uncertainty regarding full cycle deposit betas for the industry. However, we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage. Growth in net interest income is expected to continue until the Federal Reserve reaches the end of its tightening cycle. Once the Fed pauses, we would expect deposit costs to continue increasing for a couple of more quarters. This equates to 1% to 3% net interest income growth in the first quarter and 13% to 15% growth in 2023, assuming the December 31st forward rate curve. Earlier in 2022, we added a meaningful amount of hedges focused on protecting 2024 and 2025. The swaps become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and generally have a term of three years. Activity in the fourth quarter focused on extending that protection beyond 2025. We will look for attractive opportunities to continue to expand this protection. We have constructed the balance sheet to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our reported net interest margin is projected to surpass the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice. So, let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Reported noninterest income includes $50 million of insurance proceeds related to a third quarter regulatory settlement. Excluding that, adjusted noninterest income declined 9% from the prior quarter as stability in wealth management income and a modest increase in card and ATM fees were offset by declines in other categories, mainly mortgage and capital markets. Service charges declined 3% due primarily to three fewer days in the fourth quarter versus the third [Ph]. We expect to offer a grace period feature to cover overdrafts around midyear 2023 and when combined with our previously implemented enhancements, will result in full year service charges of approximately $550 million. Within capital markets, increases in M&A fees were offset by declines in all other categories, including a negative $11 million CVA and DVA adjustment. Despite an increase in servicing income, elevated interest rates and seasonally lower production drove total mortgage income lower during the quarter. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 8% to 10% compared to 2022. Let\u2019s move on to noninterest expense. Reported professional and legal expenses declined significantly driven by charges related to the settlement of a regulatory matter in the third quarter. Excluding this and other adjusted items, adjusted noninterest expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 2%, primarily due to an increase in associate headcount during the fourth quarter and higher benefits expense. Equipment and software expenses increased 4%, reflecting increased technology investments. The fourth quarter level does provide a reasonable quarterly run rate for 2023. We expect full year 2023 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5%, and we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 4%. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance remains broadly stable while experiencing expected normalization. Net charge-offs were 29 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the third quarter consumer loan sale, adjusted full year net charge-offs were 22 basis points. Nonperforming loans remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter and were below pre-pandemic levels. Provision expense was $112 million this quarter. While the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at 1.63%, the increase to the allowance was due primarily to economic conditions, normalizing credit from historically low levels and loan growth. These increases were partially offset by the elimination of the hurricane-related reserves established last quarter. Just to remind you, we believe our normalized charge-offs based on our current book of business should range from 35 to 45 basis points on an annual basis. However, due to the strength of the consumer and to businesses, we expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be in the range of 25 to 35 basis points. From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.6%, reflecting solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued loan growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook, we plan to manage capital levels near the upper end of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range over the near term. So, in closing, we delivered strong results in 2022, despite volatile economic conditions. We are in some of the strongest markets in the country, and while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction, we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers. Pretax, pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well controlled, credit remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity are solid. And with that, we\u2019ll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : In terms of your deposit beta, regarding that 35% beta assumption by year-end \u201823, what is your -- maybe help us think about what your assumption is around noninterest-bearing mix as a percentage of total deposits. How do you see that trending through the year? What\u2019s underlying that assumption? David Turner : Yes. John, this is David. So what we did, we\u2019re at 39% noninterest-bearing right now. We\u2019ve always had more noninterest-bearing than most everybody. It\u2019s just the nature of our deposit base. We said we would continue to see deposit runoff this year somewhere in the $3 billion to $5 billion range. And for our guidance, we\u2019ve taken all of that out of NIB. So you should expect that percentage of NIB to decline somewhat during the year. Now, that\u2019s just what we put in the guide. We could see some mix changes from that NIB and maybe not -- that\u2019s the most harsh it could be. So that\u2019s why we put it in the guide. So, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a follow-up there. John Pancari : Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And I think the other color on the beta provides some of the additional detail. But just separately, if I could just hop over to credit for my follow-up. Can you give us a little bit of color around what drove the increase in charge-offs in the quarter. It looks like that may have been in C&I, but I want to get a little bit of color around what you\u2019re seeing there? Are you seeing any stresses in certain pockets of your loan categories that you\u2019re watching that are starting to generate some losses? And then also what drove the 14% increase in the criticized loans? Thanks. John Turner : Yes. John, this is John. So, we did see a little uptick in business services charge-offs in the quarter related to a handful of credits. We\u2019ve identified couple areas or a couple of segments of the portfolio where we see elevated stress at the office, healthcare, consumer discretionary, senior housing and transportation on the small end of trucking in particular. We\u2019re seeing elevated levels of -- or elevating levels, I should say, of classified loans, in particular. So, to the second part of your question, we are seeing some normalization in the portfolio. Classified loans are increasing toward levels that we would expect to be more \"normalized\" and the categories in which that -- we\u2019re seeing that change are the 5 identified, but there are some odds and ends in the portfolio as well as inflationary impacts and rising rates affect isolated customers. In general, we still feel very good about credit quality. And as David said, we\u2019re guiding to 25 to 35 basis points of charge-offs in 2023. David Turner : And John, I\u2019ll add. If you look at page 19, we tried to help you with the areas that John just mentioned in terms of the higher risk segments. And you can see on that page, the strength of the allowance to cover those increases in the criticized level that we have listed in the supplement. And we don\u2019t necessarily have a loss in every one of those that migrated into criticized. But what we do see, we have already embedded in the reserve and it\u2019s factored in, as John mentioned, in our guidance of 25 to 35 in charge-offs for 2023. John Pancari : Yes. Thanks, David. I appreciate that. If I could just ask one more on that, on the reserve, you pretty much kept it stable this quarter. Could you maybe discuss the likelihood of incremental builds here, or do you think it fairly represents the scenarios of outlook that you\u2019re looking at here? David Turner : Well, we certainly believe that it represents what we think is the loss content that exists today. Obviously, every quarter, we have to reassess the economy, the quality of the portfolio at those times. So, we think we have it covered. The only bill that you would see from this standpoint that we know of would be related to new loan growth. And we\u2019re going to have some of that. We said we would grow loans about 4% end to end during the year. So, we\u2019ll need to provide for that. But we think at 1.63% is a good coverage ratio for the risk that we have in the portfolio. John Turner : Based on our current economic assumptions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I just want to follow-up on the funding side of the balance sheet. Could you talk a little bit about -- you guys have had that ability to just keep your loan-to-deposit ratio in a good spot. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could kind of help us understand what you expect to do over time in terms of your wholesale debt footprint, including long-term debt? And what that would imply then for what you expect to do with the securities book over time as well? Thank you. David Turner : Yes. So, we continue to have one of the lowest loan deposit ratios. I think, you were leading to that. We\u2019re in great markets. We continue to work on growing accounts, whether it be checking accounts or operating accounts. That\u2019s the hallmark of our whole franchise. This is the strength of that deposit base. So, we will continue to leverage that deposit base in terms of our funding mix. At least for the first half of the year, we don\u2019t see the need to go into any wholesale borrowings. We have plenty of access to that, should we need it. Most of our peers, I think, have all tapped wholesale funding already. So, we\u2019re being able to leverage that and that\u2019s where we give you the pretty strong guide in terms of our NII growth for the year of 13% to 15%. So, we\u2019ll see what the deposit flows are. As we mentioned to John earlier, the deposit outflows we see that we put in our guide is $3 billion to $5 billion. Now remember, we said 5 to 10, this past year, we were at 7. So, we\u2019ve been estimating it pretty well, and we\u2019re taking to offer our guide all of that out of NIB. So, we\u2019ll see what happens during the year. But you -- don\u2019t expect us to be looking for wholesale funding until at least the second half of the year. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then, just a follow-up. You\u2019re going to do that grace period, and we saw you reiterate the $550 million of service charges. Can you just kind of just give an update on the state of the consumer there and behavioral changes and any other learnings and findings that kind of continue to make you confident in upholding that 550 zone of service charges? John Turner : Yes. Well, Ken, we continue to see consumers maintaining good deposit balance levels. Spending is up modestly, but we think being managed very carefully by our consumer -- customer base. We feel good about the health of the consumer overall. With respect to overdrafts and the changes that we\u2019ve made to benefit customers, we\u2019ve seen about a 20% decline in the number of customers who are overdrawing their accounts on a month-to-month basis, which we are happy about. That\u2019s -- ultimately, the objective is to help customers better manage their finances. And so, I would say, all in all, we feel good about our guide and good about the impact of the changes that we\u2019ve made have had on our consumer customer base. David Turner : Yes. Ken, let me add to that. Embedded in the service charges is treasury management and treasury management has had a fantastic year. If you look at the fourth quarter for treasury management, we were up 7% fourth quarter of \u201822 to fourth quarter \u201821. If you look at the entire year, we were up 9% in TM. So, that\u2019s been a positive to us that\u2019s helped bolster that downward trend of service charges due to all the account changes that we\u2019ve made and will be a strength for us going into 2023 and gives us confidence, as John mentioned, that we can meet the 550 in service charges for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Just a big picture strategic question. Obviously, you\u2019ve done an amazing job growing the interest income and getting the rate call right. It seems like 3 for 3 here. But I guess the flip side is the kind of revenue mix has become more dependent on rates and the balance sheet, right, as we think about the fee composition. So, anyway, long story short, the question is what strategic opportunities do you have to grow the fee revenues and maybe something that\u2019s more from an acquisition point of view to accelerate that? John Turner : Well, we\u2019ve been, as you know, active making nonbank acquisitions, particularly adding to our capital markets capabilities. And we\u2019re pleased with -- despite the fact that we had a bit of a soft quarter in the fourth quarter, really pleased with the contribution that those capital markets investments are making to help us continue to strengthen relationships with customers and grow noninterest revenues up pretty dramatically over the last 6 or 7 years. Likewise, we are excited about the investments we\u2019ve made on the consumer side. Whether it be the acquisition of Ascentium Capital; which is part of our Corporate Banking group; interbank, which gives us a chance to grow loans to homeowners, mortgage servicing rights that we\u2019ve acquired, which have been helpful. And then, in the wealth space, we\u2019ve made some acquisitions that have been modestly incremental helpful to us, and we continue to look for opportunities there as well. So, we are, I think, positioning ourselves as we continue to accrete capital to making additional investments as we see those opportunities arise, we\u2019re consistently looking. And I think you can look for us to continue to try to build on the investments that we\u2019ve already made. David Turner : Yes. Matt, let me add that -- so the fact that we\u2019ve been able to grow NII is actually a positive thing. We recognize it does lower the percentage of noninterest revenue as a total. But we\u2019re very proud of the fact that we\u2019ve been able to manage our balance sheet in this manner. More importantly, we\u2019re trying to take the volatility out of that line item. And so, if you look at our ability to hedge, we\u2019re locking in what we believe to be a very strong margin range of $3.60 to $3.90 over time, regardless of what the rate environment does. And so that gives us a lot of stability there. And if that means we have higher NII and the percentage of NIR is a bit lower than it\u2019s historically been, we\u2019re okay with that. To John\u2019s point, we are going to look to use our capital for some nonbank acquisitions like you have seen us do, nothing too big, but just to bolster the NIR stream to make us more resilient in just about any environment that we have. Matt O\u2019Connor: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then just somewhat related, I\u2019ve been asking a lot of your peers the same question, but you all seem to be building capital kind of well beyond what I would have thought that you would need. And you talked about kind of the upper end to 9.25%, 9.75% CET1, and that\u2019s not new. But I guess the question is, why are you and others potentially all building what seems to be well in excess of what you need for CCAR? Are you anticipating something from CCAR changing? Is there kind of pressure behind the scenes from rating agencies, regulators or are just all the banks deciding on their own to be a little more conservative given the cycle where we are? Thank you. John Turner : Yes. Well, Matt, we can\u2019t speak for the other banks. I would say for us, it is a bit of an uncertain time. We think there potentially are opportunities to continue to make nonbank acquisitions will arise. We were fortunate enough to make 3 in a short period of time at the end of 2021. And just operating at the upper end of our range gives us some flexibility, and we\u2019d like to continue to maintain that given the uncertain environment that we\u2019re operating in. David Turner : And if you look at CCAR degradation in capital was one of the lowest of the peer group. So, we don\u2019t need capital to take care of the risk embedded in our balance sheet, it is really opportunistic -- opportunities we\u2019re looking for. And frankly, having a little bit more capital doesn\u2019t hurt us from a return standpoint. And we generated over 30% return on tangible common equity. And so, having upper end of the 9.75 won\u2019t impact any meaningful way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One, just on the loan growth outlook, I know you indicated you expect ending balances to be about 4% up year-on-year. Could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking through the dynamics of which pieces of the loan growth are likely to accelerate, be on the high side, lower side? And then, how much longer that runoff portfolio is going to impact the numbers? Thanks David Turner : Yes. So, we expect loan growth to slow just with general economy slowing. I think, our growth opportunities will manifest itself in the corporate banking group, commercial and corporate banking, as line utilization likely goes up a bit. I think there will be some opportunities in the real estate. We did have some growth of real estate, primarily multifamily, still happy with that. We do have one of the lowest concentrations of investor real estate compared to the peer group. But we look at utilizing our capital selectively with the right customers, doing the right things, in particular, like I said, multifamily. On the consumer side, our Interbank acquisition we had in the end of \u201821, as John mentioned, is doing well for us. We look for that to have opportunities to continue to grow. And mortgage, while it\u2019s going to be challenging again in \u201823 because of the rate environment, although it\u2019s settled back a bit, it will give us some opportunity to grow a bit in the consumer side. As you mentioned, we do have some runoff portfolios, our last one -- by the time we get to the end of this year, we\u2019re probably not having a discussion about exit portfolios anymore. John Turner : I would just add, despite the fact that we expect a small business customer to be under some pressure in more challenged economy, we\u2019re seeing real opportunity through the Ascentium Capital platform, making loans to businesses on business essential equipment. We\u2019re able to leverage that platform, which is very specialized in nature through our branch system into our existing customer base and over 35%-plus of our branches in 2022 originated a loan through the Ascentium Capital. We\u2019ll see more of that grow, I think, and again, another opportunity to leverage an acquisition into our existing customer base. Betsy Graseck : Yes. That was going to be one of my follow-ups, just trying to understand Ascentium and the dynamic and the driver that it is for you. And I guess the underlying question here is, is it -- what\u2019s the average size of this loan, an Ascension loan? Is it more of a small business size or medium, or maybe you can give us some color around that. John Turner : Yes. It is a small business. It\u2019s loans originated on equipment that is, as I said, business essential. So, the thesis is that that business owner is likely to pay that loan first because he has to -- he or she has to have the equipment to operate the business. The average size of the loan is about $75,000 and the term would be 3 to 4 years on average. Betsy Graseck : Okay, great. And then, just lastly, a follow-up on the funding question that came up earlier. I mean, we\u2019re hearing from others that borrowing from federal home loan banks is interesting, even though the base rate sticker price might look a little higher. You obviously get some dividend back from the swap you also get the fact that you don\u2019t have to pay the FDIC. So, I\u2019m just wondering is it at all attractive to you at some point to lean in more there or not? David Turner : Well, I think we\u2019ll need to evaluate with that closer when we get to the point where we need it. We still have opportunities. We\u2019ve had a $2 billion to $3 billion worth of corporate deposits that have moved off our balance sheet to seek higher rates that we weren\u2019t willing to pay. Those are our customers. We own their -- still have their operating account. They just moved their excess cash elsewhere. So, there\u2019s an opportunity to go back to those customers first before we need to seek other wholesale funding. But I think we have all avenues. We have term debt too that can help us with the FDIC as well. We\u2019ll just have to evaluate the total cost of all of our opportunities at that time, which I said earlier is really going to be in the second half of the year. Betsy Graseck : Right. You haven\u2019t needed that at this stage. Got it. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Stephen Scouten : So, it\u2019s hard to pick apart anything in this quarter, results were fantastic. I guess, the one question I get from people is, as we start to see maybe some normalization in credit is how do you really highlight for folks how much different your franchise is today versus pre-cycle? I know you\u2019ve laid some of that out in mid-quarter presentations, the shift to investment grade and so forth. But how would you combat that pushback from some folks? John Turner : I think balance and diversity is the first thing I would point to when you look at pre -- Great Recession our balance sheet, whether it be on the right side or the left side, assets or liabilities, we had concentrations in certain asset classes, and we were very dependent on interest-bearing deposits for funding. If you look at the reshaping of our balance sheet over time, our liability side of our balance sheet, I think, is really strong and provides as we\u2019ve talked about, to this point, foundation for our outperformance, and we expect that will continue. On the asset side of the balance sheet, we have only -- less than 10% of our outstandings are in investor real estate. That\u2019s down significantly from pre-crisis levels. And we also, I think, have been very -- very committed to concentration in risk management. We have a very active and ongoing credit risk management process, which we believe will produce much better results than we had previously delivered. We\u2019re committed to consistent sustainable long-term performance, and that requires that we manage credit risk well. At the end of the day, I know we\u2019ve got to deliver, and we intend to do that, but we think we\u2019re well positioned. David Turner : I would add that we also developed, not too long ago, a new tool. We call it our click, which didn\u2019t mean anything to you. But what it does is it analyzes the cash flows of each of our customers. And we\u2019ve built that, developed that tool to give us an idea of product and service that a customer may need from us that they don\u2019t have. What we found is it gave us such good information on cash flows every month that it gave us an earlier indicator of potential credit stress. And that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re seeing when you see us move things into criticized categories. We can be more proactive because we have better information to manage credit risk management through that tool. Stephen Scouten : Got it. That\u2019s extremely helpful. And maybe just one other question for me there is loan growth, the 4% guide, I completely respect all the shifts and concerns in the environment that may take that down there. But, you put up 11% growth this quarter, utilizations continue to increase. Where could you outperform that 4%, I guess, if the environment maybe wasn\u2019t as bad as we might fear? And -- how do you think about that shift you\u2019ve talked about into capital markets? And what could really drive that pushing some of those customers back into that space? John Turner : So, we\u2019re currently modeling about $2 billion, I think, in current outstanding that could move back -- could move off the balance sheet, capital markets open. That\u2019s a rough number, but that\u2019s -- give you some indication of a \"headwind\" if the capital markets do open. So, that could be a plus or minus to answer your question, and I think would be the one area where we probably would see more growth than we anticipated if that did not happen. David Turner : Yes. Our line utilization is still below historical levels. Every 1 point increases about $600 million in outstanding. So, we get people drawn on their lines. Perhaps that could be helpful. We\u2019ll see what the rate environment looks like with regards to mortgage. We\u2019ll see what the economy looks like for consumers to improve their home and leverage Interbank. So, there are some opportunities for us to outperform those numbers if the economy kind of continues along its current path. It\u2019s still fairly healthy, and inflation is coming down. So, I think we have some opportunity to outperform there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us -- you gave an interesting slide in your deck about how your deposit customers have more deposits in their accounts than pre-pandemic, I think, at slide 17. Have you reached out and what\u2019s driving these numbers? Because obviously, you hear about the savings rate nationally is down, but you and your peers are showing numbers like this. And I was just wondering if you could share with us what your -- some of the trends that you\u2019re seeing here that keeps these balances the way they are? David Turner : Yes. The specific page on 17 on the right-hand side, we\u2019re talking about those customers that had less than $1,000 in their account. And that -- compared to the end of \u201819, they have 6 times the balances. A big driver is that cohort was the recipient of a lot of stimulus. That stimulus could have come in the form of absolute transfer payments. It could have come in the form of minimum wage increases. Those are permanent. So, what we\u2019ve seen is our customers actually are making more money, and they\u2019re keeping it -- they\u2019re keeping their spending under control even though we have inflationary pressures. So, that cohort has had more wage growth than most everybody else. And we don\u2019t see it going away. We\u2019re a bit surprised and we\u2019re watching it every month to see if there\u2019s a change, but I think the slide was fairly consistent with what we showed you last quarter as well. So, from a -- you\u2019re really talking about just the consumer on page 17, but business customers continue to have more liquidity as well. Gerard Cassidy : I got it. So, the wage growth, they\u2019re having better wage growth than most people on this call then, right, David? David Turner : Yes, sir. Gerard Cassidy : Moving on to slide 19. In the high-risk industry segments, a couple of questions. One, can you share with us -- and maybe you addressed this already in the earlier comments on this slide. But in the office space, is it mostly the Class B and C that -- or Class B that you\u2019re more focused on than Class A? And then second, could there be other industry segments that could show up in this slide 6 months from now or 12 months from now? John Turner : Yes. Gerard, I\u2019d say with respect to your question about office, that would be accurate. We\u2019re focused on, let\u2019s say, the non-Class A -- 82% of our portfolio is Class A, 63% is in the Sunbelt. About 36% of our portfolio is single tenant. So, the portion that we are concerned about would be Class B space, a good percentage of it is also in suburban markets of 74%, I think, in suburban markets. In terms of industries or segments that we have some concern about, I would say that we\u2019re still watching senior housing closely. I think it\u2019s performed okay, post-pandemic, but it\u2019s an area that we had some concern about rising cost, availability of labor, things that impact that particular segment and then consumer discretionary as people continue to feel the pressure of rising costs and/or the uncertainty in the environment, we think that -- and as unemployment begins to moderate a bit, we think that consumer discretionary is an area that could be impacted. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Terry McEvoy : Maybe first one, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more details on, I guess, it\u2019s slide 7 in one of those footnotes, specifically how the $40 million security hedge benefit in the fourth quarter will, and I\u2019ll put in quotes here, \"migrate to loan yields\" as those hedges on loans mature. And I guess, from a high-level trend to make sure I understand the impact of that $6-plus billion hedge on securities that matured last quarter? David Turner : Yes. Sure. So, what we did at the end of December of \u201821 is we wanted to add some more sensitivity to the fourth quarter. We had some hedges that were maturing in that fourth quarter that received fixed swaps. But we wanted to move that and have those effectively terminate a quarter earlier. We could have torn those up, but it would have taken a lot of effort to do so because there are a bunch of small notionals in there and the cost and time to do that. Really, there\u2019s an easier way to do it, which is we purchased a pay fixed swap for that quarter. And so, when that sensitivity came back, it generated about $40 million in the quarter. Now, our sensitivity naturally comes back in the first quarter because we have received fixed swaps that are maturing right at the end of the year. So, that sensitivity came back naturally in the first quarter, and that\u2019s why you won\u2019t see a decline due to this $40 million that we had in the fourth quarter. That is also why we\u2019ve been able to give you guidance that we\u2019re going to grow NII in the first quarter somewhere between 1% and 3%. So, it\u2019s not a cliff. You don\u2019t need to worry about having a cliff effect for it. That makes sense? Gerard Cassidy : It does, yes. Then as a follow-up, and I don\u2019t mean to be too acute, but I\u2019ve had a few people ask me. If I look at your 1Q and full year \u201823 NII guide, does -- is the -- the fourth quarter appears lower than the first quarter. So, maybe could you just talk about kind of the trajectory of NII as you think about it today? David Turner : Well, we\u2019ve given you a guide for the year of 13% to 15% up. We\u2019ve also given you a guide from the fourth quarter to the first quarter growth of 1% to 3%. Now obviously, there\u2019s more pressure as after the Fed stops raising rates for a quarter or two, you\u2019re going to see deposit costs continue -- they lag. So, you\u2019re going to continue to see pressure after that. It\u2019s going to affect everybody in the industry that way. And so, you\u2019ll see that decline at some point quarter-over-quarter during the year. So, that\u2019s why it\u2019s harder just to extrapolate fourth quarter, but we\u2019ll see where the Fed goes. Our guidance is predicated on the December 4. If that changes, then we\u2019ll come back and update our outlook. But that gives you enough information to be able to model and do your sensitivities. But yes, there will be some declines in NII based on the forwards sometime during 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Dave Rochester : I had a follow-up on capital. You guys had a nice bump up in ratios this quarter. And just given the loan growth outlook you\u2019re talking about, it seems like you\u2019ll be at the top end of that target range for CET1 by the end of 1Q. I know the buyback hasn\u2019t been a big priority for you recently. But at what point do you think that it might make sense to turn back on? David Turner : Yes. So, as we think of capital allocation, before I get there, let me point out one thing. We do have the impact of the regulatory change that will hit us in this first quarter as everybody. That\u2019s about 10 basis points working the other way, so. But your question is broader, how do we think about capital allocation, including repurchases. So first off, we want to use our capital to support our loan growth. We want to pay a dividend in the 35% to 45% range. We\u2019ve been at the low end of that. So, we would like to operate over time, at least in the middle of that. We want to use some of our capital for nonbank acquisitions, in particular, to bolster our noninterest revenue as we discussed. I forgot who asked that question. And then, the kind of we use the share repurchase as the toggle, will keep our capital where we want it to be, which we said would be at the upper end of our range of 9.75%. We just think that\u2019s prudent with uncertainty overly negatively affect our return. So, if we go meaningfully over that, we could turn on share repurchases and we\u2019ll just have to see how that -- the capital generation should be very strong in 2023. And we should have enough to do all things I mentioned. And if we can\u2019t put our capital to work doing a nonbank acquisition, then we\u2019ll give it back to the shareholders. Dave Rochester : Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then, back on the $3 billion to $5 billion deposit runoff outlook you talked about earlier. I was glad to hear you seem to be conservative with assuming all of that runoff was in noninterest-bearing deposits. Was curious regarding the big picture, what you\u2019re seeing in the book that gets you to the $3 billion to $5 billion range? And how sensitive is that just a stronger move up in Fed funds, if we end up seeing that? And then how are you thinking about funding that runoff where that\u2019s going to come from the securities book, which is lower rate or if you\u2019re assuming some of that or most of that comes out of cash at this point in your NII outlook? David Turner : Yes. We have plenty of cash right now to take care of that runoff. So, that\u2019s not a big deal. That $3 billion to $5 billion, there\u2019s some corporate changes in there that will be seeking rates. There\u2019s some consumer changes that are seeking rates. Historically, movements like this happen late cycle. So, we\u2019re getting there. We all think that we\u2019re getting towards the end of the cycle. And so, people will look to capture that upside so they can lock in the best rate before rates start going the other way. So, how much conservatism we have in there? We\u2019ll see. We had a pretty big run-up in deposits, $40 billion during the pandemic, and we\u2019re holding on to quite a bit of that, more so than we originally thought. But I think it\u2019d be prudent to -- we think it\u2019s prudent to put in this runoff of $3 billion to $5 billion and again, conservatively all in NIB. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Could you speak to concerns that we could see the mix of time deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits return, potentially not just the pre-COVID levels, but back to pre-GFU [ph] levels in this environment? You\u2019ve given a lot of great detail on the strength of your deposit franchise, but it would be great to hear your thoughts on sort of that risk, both broadly at the industry level and more specifically for reasons as we look ahead from here. David Turner : Yes. You\u2019re breaking up a little bit, but I think what your question was, is how do we think about time deposits versus noninterest-bearing deposits and where will we settle out over time? So, we\u2019re sitting here today at 39% noninterest-bearing. There have been some movements out of that to -- because we were over 40% into CDs. So, we do believe there\u2019s going to be some remixing. That\u2019s built into our beta assumption of 35% through the end of the year. We still think we\u2019ll have more NIB than most everybody because that\u2019s the nature of our deposit book. Very granular deposits, in particular on the consumer side where we have leading primacy that makes a difference. So, money goes in, money goes out. They\u2019re not seeking rate, they use it as there -- that\u2019s their operating account. And so, we believe that we will continue to see some decline in the NIB. Again, we conservatively put $4 billion out of that. We think there\u2019s probably a chance that there\u2019ll be -- it won\u2019t all come out of NIB, but we thought that was the best thing to do from a guidance standpoint. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then separately, I wanted to follow up on your comments around the NIM protection that you put in place, how would you respond to the view that the downside protection that banks are putting on in this environment doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense because of the negative carry associated with it since the forward curve, discounts, everything that we see in the current environment, you\u2019re effectively just investing at whatever the yield curve is -- whatever the yield curve is at the moment. David Turner : Well, the most important thing to remember is our hedging strategy is not meant to generate increases in NII. It is a risk reduction measure. It\u2019s a hedge, is to protect us in low rates. When you have a deposit franchise like we do that has lower costs than our peers, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been historically. As rates come down, we don\u2019t have a mechanism to protect our net interest margin because we can\u2019t lower deposit costs much as low as our peers can. Therefore, we have to do it synthetically. And that\u2019s what the hedge program does. And we set these up generally forward starting. So, we don\u2019t have negative carry until they start -- or the risk of negative carry until they start. And frankly, if we do at that time, that means rates are higher, and the rest of our book is earning that much more, and we\u2019re okay with that. What it means is, yes, it costs us a little bit in NII, but we have a leading margin. So, we\u2019re okay. You can\u2019t think of it as a trade as some people talk about it as being a trade. That\u2019s not what it is. It\u2019s a hedge to protect us in low rate. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with Truist Securities. Jennifer Demba : A question on loan growth. I\u2019m just curious how much competitive retrenchment you\u2019re seeing from the banks you compete with most often? And how offensive are you willing to get for credits that look really attractive right now to you? John Turner : Well, I would say, first of all, plenty of competition out there. And we don\u2019t -- while there are certain segments, particularly real estate, where there are some competitors who are not as active today for a variety of reasons, in general, the market is very competitive, whether it be large banks, regional banks, smaller banks that we compete with. And so, we\u2019ve got to be actively calling on our customers and our prospects and being very diligent in our activities, making sure that we\u2019re in the market in front of customers. When we\u2019re doing that, we get opportunities. With respect to how aggressive we want to be, we don\u2019t change our approach to how we think about credit risk management, how we think about pricing and structure. We want to win because we have expertise because we provide really good ideas and solutions to customers, and we think that that resonates, and as a result, has helped us continue to build on growth in our portfolio. Jennifer Demba : Great. Thanks a lot. John Turner : Okay. That\u2019s all the calls, I think. I\u2019d just end by saying we\u2019re awfully proud of our 2022 results and the momentum that we\u2019re carrying into 2023. We\u2019ve worked hard over the last 10 years to remake our business and to build a balance sheet and income statement and importantly, a culture of risk management that will allow us to deliver consistent, sustainable performance. And we think we\u2019re seeing that now. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on organic growth and investing in our business, and we believe we\u2019ll continue to deliver the kinds of results that you\u2019ve seen in 2022. So, thank you for your interest in our company, and have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

We\u2019ve spent over a decade enhancing our interest rate risk, credit risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks. Our relationship-based banking approach, coupled with our favorable geographic footprint uniquely positions us to weather an uncertain market backdrop. Further, balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet have been a key focus for years. As a result, we are well positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. Approximately 70% of our deposits are retail deposits. These deposits tend to be granular and less rate sensitive. In fact, approximately 90% of these deposits are insured. Our strategy focuses on primacy and customer loyalty. We want to be our customers\u2019 primary banking relationship. This strategy is evident in the fact that over 90% of our consumer checking households include a high-quality checking account, and over 60% of consumer checking deposit balances are with customers that have been with regions for 10 years or more. Our wholesale or business services deposits are also highly diversified from an industry, size and geography perspective, with approximately 75% of deposits that are either insured, operational in nature or collateralized. In total, approximately 75% of our deposits across all business lines are insured or collateralized by securities and our deposits are with customers we know is over 97% reside within our 15-state footprint. Further supporting our high-quality deposit franchise, we had access to total primary liquidity of approximately $41 billion at the end of the quarter, sufficient to cover uninsured retail and nonoperational wholesale deposits by more than a 2 :1 ratio. If you include access to Federal Reserve discount window, available liquidity increases to $54 billion or approximately 3 :1 coverage. We have a strong team of bankers and the recent disruption has given us an opportunity to connect with our customers and top prospects to answer questions and reassure them of our stability. We\u2019ve experienced some deposit outflows as corporate treasuries look to diversify and sought higher interest rates for their excess cash. However, we\u2019ve also experienced deposit inflows from new and existing customers. Importantly, our total deposits at March 31st were roughly unchanged from what they were prior to the onset of liquidity concerns in the industry. The majority of the $3 billion deposit decrease this quarter was as expected, due primarily to further normalization in corporate deposits, which had dramatically increased during the pandemic, as well as the continuation of rate-seeking behavior in certain wealth and higher balance consumer accounts. From a lending perspective, our focus on risk-adjusted returns continues. Overall sentiment among our corporate customers remains positive. While most are forecasting strong performance in 2023, they are expecting modest declines from levels seen in 2022. While current market conditions warrant heightened caution, we believe our strong liquidity profile provides an advantage in terms of supporting our customers\u2019 borrowing needs. In closing, despite all the industry turmoil, we feel very good about our balance sheet and strong liquidity position. And through our proactive hedging strategies, we are positioned for success in any interest rate environment. Our granular deposit base and relationship-based banking model continue to serve us well, and we\u2019re proud to continue supporting our customers\u2019 banking needs. Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let\u2019s start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 2% sequentially. Average business loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across the utilities, retail trade and financial services industries. Approximately 87% of this growth was again driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses. Average consumer loans increased 1% as growth in mortgage and Interbank was partially offset by continued pay-downs in home equity and runoff exit portfolios. Looking forward, we continue to expect 2023 ending loan growth of approximately 4%. From a deposit standpoint, our deposit base remains a strength and competitive advantage with balances continuing to largely perform as expected. Previously, we indicated that combination of rapidly rising interest rates and normalization of surge deposits would likely lead to $3 billion to $5 billion of deposit declines by midyear before we would begin to generate net deposit growth. While the events in March created turmoil in the banking industry, we continue to believe that range is appropriate. However, we may be at the higher end of the range as we approach midyear. The preponderance of deposit outflows this quarter occurred prior to early March and were in line with our expectations. Approximately $2 billion of the $3 billion outflow came from corporate deposits, reflecting normal seasonal activity. The other $1 billion came from a continuation of rate-seeking behavior among certain wealth and higher balance consumer clients. The same characteristics that contribute to our deposit advantage in a rising rate environment are also helpful in a time of systemic volatility. As John noted, our focus on attracting and retaining a diverse and granular deposit base with high primacy drives loyalty and trust and instills funding stability. So, let\u2019s shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income continued to expand with market interest rates in the first quarter, reflecting our asset-sensitive profile and funding stability. Net interest income grew 1% linked quarter to a record $1.4 billion and net interest margin increased 23 basis points to 4.22%. As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of low-yielding loans and securities generated through the pandemic. At this stage in the rate cycle, we expect accelerating deposit costs through repricing and remixing. Importantly, recent trends remain within our expectation. The cycle-to-date deposit beta is 19%, and our guidance for 2023 is unchanged, a 35% full-cycle beta by year-end. We remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for Regions when compared to the broader industry. Net interest income is projected to grow between 12% and 14% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The midpoint of the range is supported by the March 31st market forward yield curve, which projects nearly 75 basis points of rate cuts in 2023. A stable Fed funds level would push net interest income to the upper end of the range. The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of our earnings stability in today\u2019s uncertain environment. Hedges added to date create a well-protected net interest margin profile through 2025. Forward starting received fixed swaps will become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and generally have a term of three years. Activity in the first quarter focused on extending that protection beyond 2025. In addition to forward starting swaps, we added a $1.5 billion collar strategy, selling rate caps to pay for rate floors to limit exposure to extreme market rate movements. The resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our net interest margin is projected to remain above the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice. So, let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income declined 3% from the prior quarter as modest increases in service charges and wealth management income were offset by declines in other categories, primarily capital markets and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased slightly as seasonally higher treasury management fees offset declines in overdraft fees. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets increased 4% sequentially as growth in real estate capital markets, loan syndications, and debt and securities underwriting more than offset declines in M&A fees and commercial swaps. We did have a negative $33 million CVA and DVA adjustment, reflecting lower long-term interest rates, volatility in credit spreads as well as a refinement in our valuation methodology. Card and ATM fees were negatively impacted by a $5 million increase in reserves, driven by higher reward redemption rates. With respect to our outlook, and incorporating first quarter results, we expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 6% to 8% compared to 2022. Let\u2019s move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 2%, primarily due to merit and a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. FDIC insurance assessment reflects the previously announced industry-wide increase in the assessment rate schedules. In contrast to the prior two years, we expect first half 2023 adjusted expenses to be higher than the second half of the year. And we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5%. We now expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 2%. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs were 35 basis points in the quarter. Nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased while total delinquencies decreased. Provision expense was $135 million, while the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at 1.63%. The amount of the allowance increased due primarily to economic changes and normalizing credit from historically low levels, partially offset by a reduction associated with the elimination of the accounting for troubled debt restructured loans. It is worth noting the outcome of the most recent Shared National Credit exam is reflected in our results. I want to take a few minutes to speak to our commercial real estate portfolio. Since 2008, we have deliberately limited our exposure to this space. At quarter-end, our exposure totaled 15% of loans, excluding owner-occupied and it is highly diverse. This total includes $8.4 billion of investor real estate and $6.7 billion of unsecured exposure, of which the vast majority is within real estate investment trust. Our REIT clients generally have low leverage and strong access to liquidity with 68% classified as investment grade. Importantly, total office represents just 1.8% of total loans at $1.8 billion. Of note, 83% consist of Class A properties with 62% located within the Sunbelt. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate weighted average loan-to-value of 58% and we have stressed the portfolio to include a 25% discount using the Green Street commercial property price index with the weighted average resulting loan-to-value of the book approximating 77%. It is also noteworthy that 37% of our secured office portfolio is single tenant. While we are carefully monitoring conditions, we believe our portfolio will be able to weather the weakness in the industry. Including first quarter results, we now expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be approximately 35 basis points. Given the recent economic uncertainty and market volatility, we may see a pickup in the pace of normalization towards our through-the-cycle annual charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points over time. From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.8%, reflecting solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued loan growth and approximately $100 million or 7 basis points related to the phase-in of CECL into regulatory capital. Given current macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory uncertainty, we anticipate managing capital levels at or modestly above 10% over the near term. So, in closing, we delivered solid results in the first quarter despite volatile conditions. We have balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet and are well positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. We are in some of the strongest markets in the country. And while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction, we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers. Pretax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity levels remain robust. With that, we\u2019ll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : David, maybe a question on betas and deposit balances. So, you guys are one of the few that isn\u2019t increasing your deposit beta guidance given that you\u2019re at 19% and I think expectations are for 35%. Can you maybe just talk about where you expect the pressure to come from? I think you noted in the remarks, repricing and remixing, how much will each of these contribute? Are you expecting more to be in retail given the push for insured deposits, or is it on the commercial side? And then second, you noted that you do expect to see stabilization of growth in balances later in the year. Can you maybe just talk about what you see driving that as we move through the year? Thanks. David Turner : Sure. So, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, we had $41 billion worth of surge deposits. We didn\u2019t think those would stay with us as long as they actually have stayed with us. And we furthermore said as rates continue to increase that people would be seeking higher returns than we were offering at the time. And so you can see our cumulative beta, as you mentioned, at 19%, well below everybody else. We do understand that we\u2019re going to end up -- there\u2019s going to be a shift of deposits into CDs, more expensive deposits. And so, we do also expect some continued runoff. We had given you the guide of $3 billion to $5 billion. We\u2019re down $3.3 billion. We expect to be at the upper end of that by the end of the second quarter. And a lot of that is putting money to work and businesses, but also some seeking higher rates. And so, the combination of where we are relative to our deposit costs relative to the peers would imply that we would be increasing some of that over time, and that\u2019s going to drive our beta, and we still believe 35% is the right number by the end of the cycle, which we\u2019re calling the end of this year. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, so you guys are now expecting losses at the high end of your previous guidance. It looks like the increase this quarter was driven by C&I. And I think, David, I think you just noted you could see a pickup in the pace of normalization. Can you maybe just talk about, one, what is driving the incremental pressure? And what are you expecting to be the higher driver of charge-offs, both for the rest of this year and then the pace of normalization that we could see? Thanks. David Turner : Well, so as we\u2019ve stated many times, the charge-off level is below normal. And that we said it would be normalizing over time. We\u2019ve furthermore set our normalized loss rate based on the risk profile we maintained as 35 to 45. As we get through the end of this year, we\u2019re trying to give you the message that that could kind of lead you into a run rate towards that 35 to 45 by the end of the year. We\u2019re already at 35 this quarter, which would imply we expect a reduction in charge-offs in the second and/or third quarter. But all in, we still think we\u2019re going to be at 35 basis points, which is below normal. So, we have a lot of confidence in that. We had certain things that happened in the first quarter, we don\u2019t think will repeat. And so I think our 35 is a pretty good number. John Turner : Yes. Ryan, I\u2019d just add to the question about where we\u2019re seeing the stress. We\u2019ve identified a couple of areas on previous calls where we are experiencing some stress in the portfolio. That would be healthcare, where we\u2019re seeing rising costs and pressure on labor. Transportation, particularly on the smaller end of the transportation sector where customers are competing in the spot market to move product. Consumer discretionary, where consumers are changing their buying patterns and moving away from more discretionary items towards services where we\u2019re seeing some pressure; office, obviously; and then senior housing, which is a sector that we believe is improving but still not return to occupancy levels that we experienced prior to the pandemic. And again, it\u2019s a sector where labor is a factor in the operations of those businesses and driving cost up. So, those are all areas where we are seeing more pressure than in the rest of the portfolio. And I would finally comment, I think we\u2019ll see some additional, quote, movement toward normalization. But, we\u2019ve probably gotten there a little faster than I think we thought we would. So, we don\u2019t expect a whole lot of additional deterioration as we move towards normalization. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is for David. You continue to have that long -- I think about a long-term NIM of 3.6% to 4%. I think investors are starting to think about rates cut in 2024. And I\u2019m low to always ask about 2024, but I think investors are thinking about how inexpensive bank stocks are really, right, trying to evaluate them on what could be trough earnings next year. So, if the Fed cuts, can you still stay within that range? And I think nobody is expecting a cut to zero, but perhaps walk us through the scenario of that range in the scenario of like a 200 basis-point cut over one year? David Turner : Yes. So, the bottom line answer is yes, we do feel comfortable under any scenario. As we mentioned that we would operate in that 3.60% to 4% range. Clearly, our guidance is based on the market. I mean, on the March 31st forward, it has three cuts, 75 basis points worth of cuts after one increase. So, to the extent that were to happen, we will still be within that range. If it stays higher than that, then we\u2019d be at the upper end of the range. And we have some received fixed swaps that actually come on board in the second half of the year to protect us from lower rates. We\u2019re not saying that the rates will be cut. That\u2019s what the market says. I personally don\u2019t see that that will happen at that pace. But we wanted to be able to center the discussion on what the market is saying, and that\u2019s why we gave you that and then we gave you some sensitivity around it. So, we feel very good about the range. Where we are in the range? There are a whole lot of factors. The pace, the timing of cuts would take us down, even if we had a couple of hundred basis points of cuts, then \u201824, we\u2019re still in the range. So, does that get you what you wanted? Erika Najarian : Yes. And as we think about perhaps a more measured pace of cut, how would you anticipate being able to normalize your deposit costs in that backdrop? David Turner : Say that again. How would we -- say that again, Erika. Erika Najarian : Yes. How quickly could you lower deposit costs in an environment where the Fed is cutting in a measured pace? I\u2019m just trying to think about the other side as I think about your -- sort of your long-term NIM target range? David Turner : Yes. Well, so you can see our deposit cost relative to our peers is 19% fair are lagging. And so, the ability to cut, we have to be competitive. We have to offer a fair price to our customer base. And I think to the extent you start seeing a pause and/or cuts coming from the Fed, the beta that we just mentioned could change and may not be as severe. What happens is the increase in deposit cost lagged the last increase of -- that the Fed is going to have. So, it will take some time for that to manifest itself. So, if you look at the retail side, the retail side is very slow to react. But on the commercial side, it\u2019s almost instantaneous as treasurers look to lock in the best yield that they can. We have some index deposits that move with changes in Fed funds. So that will react pretty quickly, which I think is a benefit to us in that scenario. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : In terms of your maintaining the cumulative or through-cycle beta at 35%, I hear you where you\u2019re trending down 19% in your confidence. But I\u2019m just curious how the liquidity crisis through March and how it really impacted that outlook. We saw a number of of other banks increased their deposit beta expectations given the intensifying pressure around deposit costs as well as broader funding costs. So, how has the liquidity crisis impacted your view? And how does that not influence an increase in how you\u2019re thinking about the through-cycle beta? If you could just walk us through that. David Turner : Yes, John. So our -- this is -- our competitive advantage is our deposit base. And so we haven\u2019t had to react at the pace at others. So if you look at the incremental beta of our core peer group, that was some 73% this quarter and ours was 40%, 41%. So we just haven\u2019t had to move at the pace and I still think based on how we fund ourselves, the core retail, 70% of our deposits being retail really has helped us from being able to keep that beta where it is at 35%. So, as we think about some of the larger customers that are seeking rates, seeking returns, that\u2019s where there\u2019s been more competitive pressure and we saw some of that being put to work in the first quarter. And we called for some of that. That\u2019s part of the $3 billion to $5 billion that we\u2019re talking about. As a matter of fact, in our beta assumption, we had all that coming out of noninterest bearing. That wasn\u2019t quite what we saw, but we gave it -- we assumed noninterest-bearing because that was more conservative to give you the guidance. And so if you take all that into consideration, I think that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t see us change our cumulative basis of 35%. And being at 19%, there\u2019s a long way to go from 19% to 35%. We understand that, but if we miss it, maybe it\u2019s a tad underneath that, which is why we gave you also some guidance on our slide number 7, that would show you if beta was a little bit better than 35%, how much it might mean. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, David. That\u2019s helpful. And then, separately, on the capital front, I know you increased your target to 10% -- and so just -- or 10% or just above, I believe you said. If you could maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the rationale. And then, could that allow for buybacks at some point? How are you thinking about deployment and the pace of where you -- the timing of when you get to around that 10% range? David Turner : Sure. So, you saw our common equity Tier 1 increase from 9.6% to 9.8%, and that\u2019s after absorbing about 7 basis points due to the CECL impact for the first quarter. So, we\u2019re generating 20 to 30 basis points worth of CET1 every quarter. After loan growth, we first and foremost want to be here as a source of strength for our customers and be able to make all creditworthy loans we can make. And we\u2019re open for business and ready to do that. That\u2019s what our job is. We want to make sure we pay our shareholders a fair dividend, 35% to 45% of our earnings in the form of a dividend, and we have been at the lower end of that. But -- and then we\u2019ve used our capital for other nonbank acquisitions and mortgage servicing right acquisitions, which we\u2019d like to continue. And then to optimize our capital, we\u2019ll buy stock back from time to time. Given the uncertainty that\u2019s in the market, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of review going on to what happened in the month of March, and there\u2019s going to be some reports coming out from our regulatory supervisors on what may change. And we just want to be prepared for that, and we think it would be inappropriate at this time to be buying our stock back when we have this kind of uncertainty. You\u2019ll lop on top of that the uncertainty in the economy and monetary policy. So there\u2019s just a lot of noise, which caused us to rethink, let\u2019s just wait, let us accrete up to that 10%, maybe slightly over that. And to the extent things settle down, then we\u2019ll optimize capital, and we\u2019ll use share repurchases as a mechanism to do so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: How are you thinking about managing liquidity going forward? Obviously, like with a very strong deposit base, you\u2019ve been less reliant on wholesale borrowing. But both in light of current conditions and then just kind of the way the regulation might be moving, what are you thinking about in terms of borrowings and then also both cash and securities? And again, like you\u2019ve got a smaller AFS book than others, which has worked well given the moving rates. But what\u2019s the outlook on both the funding and asset side? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So, we still believe in growing customer relationships, core checking accounts and operating accounts of businesses. It\u2019s the basis of our whole business, and we\u2019ll continue to do that from -- to help us from a liquidity standpoint. Clearly, some things have changed. We\u2019ve given you a list of our total primary liquidity and also liquidity at the discount window, should we need it. What we\u2019ve learned, I think, over this, is that it can move much quicker that we all had anticipated the world has changed a bit. And so, we\u2019ve had one of the largest cash balances of anybody in the peer group, the lower securities book. And we did that intentionally because we were not clear on the surge deposits on the pace that they would move out. So, we\u2019ll probably maintain a bit more cash than we historically have been. Obviously, there\u2019s -- currently, there\u2019s a new term bank facility that the Fed created that\u2019s temporary. I hope there\u2019s some thinking about how to maybe keep some of that in place. But we did not use that, as you can tell from our disclosures. But we tested it after quarter end, just to make sure the pipes were worked up, and I think we borrowed $1,000 and repaid it quickly. But posting collateral to something like that, that you can get access to quickly. Clearly, the Federal Home Loan Bank is still our primary source we go to. We have a little bit outstanding there at quarter end, a couple of billion dollars. And so, just having access to multiple levels -- if we learned anything, it\u2019s diversification. And you need to make sure your funding side is diverse. And within your deposit base, it needs to be diverse. So if you end up with a concentration, you end up with a problem. So I think that\u2019s a big lesson learned for everybody and staying as diverse, so we can a little more cash on hand I think, is in order. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then specifically on the securities book, how would you think about that relative to assets kind of near or longer term with the current framework? David Turner : We\u2019ve historically been in that 20% range of earning assets, and we don\u2019t see that changing dramatically. I think we need to be careful. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about shortening up maturities and things of that nature. And we need to be real careful because there could be broad implications of that. The banking system is a big buyer of mortgage-backed securities, and we need to support the mortgage industry and the housing industry and consumers that way. So, we are forced to go too short. There are much broader implications to the economy. So we\u2019re going to be careful of that. We\u2019ll see what the policymakers come up with and we\u2019ll adapt and overcome as we see fit. But right now, I think having a book about where we\u2019ve been, which is a little lower than others, I think, is the right spot for us based on our -- again, our funding profile. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : John or David, or both of you, obviously, Regions has derisked its balance sheet dramatically from the \u201808, \u201809 time period. And so, I think you guys are in a good position to maybe handle this question, specifically for commercial real estate. Can you guys share with us the differences that you are seeing in the current commercial real estate market in your portfolio versus what it was like in \u201808, \u201809. Now granted, I know you\u2019ve lowered the exposure. So, that\u2019s a major difference. But in terms of the cap rates, obviously, have moved up, the refinancing risk is here. But can you share with us how you guys could handle that more -- I\u2019m assuming more easily today than what happened in \u201808, \u201809. John Turner : Yes. Gerard, this is John. I would say we rebuilt our business beginning in kind of the \u201809, \u201810 time frame, recognizing that it\u2019s very much a specialized business. And we\u2019ve built it around professional real estate bankers who are working with professional real estate developers. Generally, they are either regional or national developers. They have strong capital positions, good access to liquidity, strong track records. They\u2019re operating in some of the primary markets across the U.S. We rebuilt our business with a focus on concentration risk management. So it\u2019s well distributed, portfolio is across different segments of the industry as well as across geographies. We have built a business, I think, very conservatively from a structural standpoint requiring good equity in projects. And we\u2019re constantly stressing our exposure. It\u2019s a relationship business for us. We\u2019re transacting with customers who maintain deposit relationships with us who use our capital markets capabilities. We\u2019re very close to those customers. And as a consequence, I think we have a very good handle on the exposure that we have across the business. And we have the benefit of operating in some of the best markets in the country as well. If you look at markets like Dallas and Houston, Orlando, Charlotte, Atlanta and Nashville, where we\u2019re doing business and where the majority of our portfolio resides, we have good underpinning economy to help support the projects as well. Gerard Cassidy : And maybe, David, on a technical question regarding the commercial real estate, how does the elimination of TDRs now help or hinder you\u2019re guys working out with some of your customers that may inevitably have an issue with their property? David Turner : Well, we\u2019re not going to let an accounting change, change or what we\u2019re going to do for our customer. If we need to have a restructuring, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. And we\u2019ll let the accounting is what it is. So I don\u2019t think that will impact us at all, Gerard, from moving forward just like we always have. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up question, another technical one for you, David. Can you just remind us about the CECL being phased into capital, just the time range and how that may affect your capital ratios going forward? David Turner : It\u2019s roughly the same number you just saw. It\u2019s almost a straight line number over, I think, it\u2019s four periods. So we\u2019ve got more of these coming. It\u2019s $100 million in round numbers, Gerard, in the first quarter of each of the next three years, about 7 points -- I\u2019m sorry, two more years. And so, it will be about a 7 basis-point hit to us each of the next two years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Peter Winter : You guys had pretty solid average loan growth this quarter and did maintain the period-end outlook. Can you just talk about loan demand? And then, secondly, if there\u2019s any areas maybe where you\u2019re tightening underwriting standards or being more selective at this stage? John Turner : Yes. So, we -- obviously, in this economy, we want to be thoughtful about any new relationships that we acquire and any new credit that we book. I think I would like to think that we\u2019re not changing our underwriting standards that they are consistent across all economic cycles. But at the same time, when you think about allocation of capital and lending into this environment, we want to be thoughtful and prudent. We want to make sure that any new business we get as a result of calling activity that\u2019s been ongoing for some time. We understand the relationship potential and opportunity that we have a good plan. The bulk of the loan growth that we\u2019ve experienced in the wholesale business has been loans to existing customers. And in the last quarter, a good bit of the growth was in our industry verticals, particularly in power and utilities, energy and the industrial space. We\u2019re also seeing a little growth within our Regions Business Capital business, asset-based lending business during this period of time. And then on the consumer side, mortgage grew and Interbank grew as a result of putting mortgage because we\u2019re generating some arms during the period -- on balance sheet arms in a period like this. I think loan growth, clearly, our loan pipelines, I should say, on the wholesale side of the business are down. And I think that reflects caution on the part of customers as well as projects, just the economy is slowing a bit as a result of rising rates and increasing cost. We still believe, given sort of our view of the future and known projects that are either underway or will get underway, there is -- we have an opportunity to grow loans. I think we\u2019re guiding to about 4% between now and end of the year and should see growth in the same categories that I just described. David Turner : I think, Peter, I\u2019ll add to that, as part of the growth outlook, because of the markets that we operate in, we\u2019ve been the recipient of a lot of migration of people and businesses into where we operate. And so, our economy here is a bit different than certain other economies around the country. And I think that\u2019s given us some confidence that our 4% loan growth is reasonable. Peter Winter : Got it. Very helpful. And if I could ask about the guidance on the deposit service charges, still $550 million. Question is how should we think about the second half of the year from the impact of that grace period? Will it step down to, I guess, around $120 million. And could you offset some of that with just account growth and cross-selling treasury management services? David Turner : Yes. So, you can see that our -- if you annualize where we ended up in the first quarter, we would be above the $550 million, and that\u2019s an acknowledgment that our last change of 24-hour grace actually goes in the beginning of the third quarter. And so you\u2019re going to see that step down more so in the third and fourth quarter than you have seen because we haven\u2019t made the change. One of the things that we\u2019ve been -- the recipients of is our treasury management investments we\u2019ve made on people and technology have really helped offset to some degree at least, the decline we\u2019re seeing from the consumer service charges, and we expect that to continue. So, we\u2019re up some 8% there in TM. And if this continues at that pace, we might have a better answer for you next earnings call. But right now, we\u2019re calling for $550 million and with a step down in the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a follow-up also on the fee side. I know, obviously, it\u2019s been a tougher start to the year in capital markets and you\u2019re reiterating that 60 to 80 zones that you kind of were in, in the first quarter. Just maybe you give us color on just how the business is feeling and acting in terms of pipelines and expectations and whether or not you anticipate there being a -- is there a bounce built into your expectation in the second half? Thanks. John Turner : Yes. We do, Ken, expect the business to pick up in the second half of the year. It\u2019s still I would say, modestly improving, but the second quarter will probably look a lot like the first is our guess. Our business is -- a good bit of our business is built around real estate capital markets and our real estate customers, and that business has just been really, really slow. If you look at the component parts of our business, generally speaking, whether it\u2019s syndication revenue, revenue generated from fixed income placement or derivative sales, has been pretty good over the course of the first quarter. But real estate capital markets has been very soft. M&A was pretty good in the first quarter. We expect that to be true through the balance of the year. So I think we\u2019re guiding to pick up in the second half of the year, and we believe that\u2019s very possible. David Turner : And just for clarification, make sure, Ken, that you and John said you should expect the second quarter to look like the first quarter. That\u2019s ex CVA, DVA. So, we\u2019re talking about the flower in the -- probably in the middle of the 60 to 80 range is about where we would expect that. And we don\u2019t expect to have a CVA, DVA adjustment quite as volatile as you just saw this quarter. Ken Usdin : I appreciate that. Yes. And second question, just on the loan side. As far as the outlook goes, when you think about just the combination of either your supply of credit and the demand of credit in this changing environment that we\u2019re in, just what\u2019s happening on the lending side of things in terms of how the environment is changing that? Are you guys tightening up at all? Is it more about the end client that\u2019s changing their demand functions? John Turner : Well, naturally, in a softening economy, if you will, we are going to probably be a little more conservative, even though I would say that we like to -- as I said a few minutes ago, we like to think that our underwriting standards don\u2019t change from economic period to economic period. We are in some very good markets, as David pointed out, and while pipelines are softer, we see people that are -- still have opportunities. We want to be smart about client selectivity all the time, probably even more so during periods like this. We want to support our existing customers and some 90 -- almost 85% of -- in round numbers of loan growth we\u2019ve experienced in the last quarter was to existing customers. So, we are acquiring some new customers but being very thoughtful about that. And then separately, while our economies are good, and we do see some opportunity, pipelines are down because of, I think, customer caution related to still difficulty acquiring labor. There are two open jobs in the Southeast for every one person looking for a job. So labor market is still tight. And costs, while moderating, have risen fairly significantly, including interest costs, obviously, which puts pressure on projects. So I think for the balance of the year, we\u2019ll probably see pipelines will have moderated and stay fairly muted, but we believe we can deliver the loan growth that we\u2019re projecting, despite that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : In the past, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the fact that you\u2019re not going to need debt financing for, I don\u2019t know, several quarters. And I just wanted to see if you could give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about that, especially as you -- even though your size doesn\u2019t come into the current TLAC expectations there is the potential for that to happen over time. And I wanted to hear how you\u2019re thinking about that. Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So from a debt financing standpoint, we borrowed a little bit from the FHLB as you saw. But the larger term financing, we said we\u2019d push off probably until the second half of the year. We don\u2019t know what the regime is going to be, if there will be any change pushed down to us from a TLAC standpoint. At some point, whether we had that or not, we need some more term financing, some term debt that we\u2019ll put on. And so, I think that we can make sure we deal with that over time. Betsy, I would say that the changes that are at least being bandied around right now. You can\u2019t move too fast because we all can\u2019t go out there and raise a bunch of debt at the same time. It would be tough for the market to absorb. So I think any change that might be coming relative to that would be over time. And I still think there\u2019s going to be some tailoring. What that looks like, what that means, we\u2019ll have to find out to with our regulatory supervisors and policymakers decide. But outside of something like that, and we have a little bit of term debt that we need to get done, and that\u2019s really pointed towards the back half of this year. And that\u2019s included in our guidance. Betsy Graseck : Right. And that was something that you had been talking about for a while. Just wondering if it\u2019s feasible to give us a sense as to size, if that\u2019s reasonable or not? David Turner : No, we haven\u2019t done that yet. So, we\u2019re still working out what that needs to look like and precise timing, too. But we don\u2019t expect it this first half of the year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately, could you just give us a sense on the expense outlook that you\u2019ve got for 2023, the kinds of levers that you have to keep the expense guide in the range that you\u2019ve got 4.5 to 5.5, and if there\u2019s anything in particular that you could point us to in terms of opportunities for efficiency improvements from here? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And we tried to -- not tried, we gave guidance that our first quarter was going to be a high watermark. I\u2019m not sure that made it into everybody\u2019s expectations, but it is what it is. We\u2019ve now given you guidance again that we think the first half of the year will be higher than the second half of the year. We had some things that we knew were coming in the first half, including we moved our merit month, our merit increase up a month from April to March. So you\u2019ve seen that in our first quarter. And any event, I think when you look at the way to work on expenses, the first thing are salaries and benefits and making sure that you\u2019ve got the right people, right number of the right people doing the right things. And I think that\u2019s always a challenge and we continue to look at process improvement, leveraging technology so that when we have attrition, natural attrition, perhaps we don\u2019t have to backfill as people if we can move that at the same time. We\u2019ve looked at our occupancy. I do think return to work is still trying to find its way and -- but we likely have more square footage than we need, whether it be in the branch space or the office space. And so, we have a team constantly working on square footage, which is our second highest cost. From a technology standpoint, we\u2019re having to make room to go through our transformation we\u2019re working on right now. And so, those costs are going up, and we\u2019re able to have cuts in other places to pay for it. Vendor spend is another area where we really make sure that we limit our use of consultants or contracts with vendors. We just make sure we get the best deal we can, and we have a team working on that. So there is a cost pool in this company and that\u2019s not going to go through some type of challenge during this year because you don\u2019t have a tailwind in \u201824 for rates. So, you\u2019ve got to do -- start working on your expenses today to help \u201824, and we\u2019re doing that. And so, we have pretty good confidence in our expense number that 4.5% to 5.5% right now for this year. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Stephen Scouten : I just wanted to ask a little bit about the adjusted revenue guidance. Obviously, I can appreciate that would be down a little bit given the funding pressures industry-wide. But as I look at your results from this quarter, it kind of feels like they were within guidance from last quarter and the NIM was exceptionally high. So, it just feels like you might be ahead of schedule versus having to pair that guidance back. So, I\u2019m wondering if you can walk me through the main drivers of that reduction. David Turner : Well, there are two primary drivers. The first is we used in our guidance the March 31st forward curve that had 75 basis points worth of cuts in the year with one increase. So you\u2019re down into the 450 range by the end of the year. So we then tried to sensitize that. We told you if that wouldn\u2019t quite there, how much that may mean. And you can see that on page 7 of the deck. So that was number one. Number two, we just had -- our capital markets was down quite a bit in the first quarter, primarily driven by -- or at least a good portion of it driven by the CVA/DVA adjustment. We don\u2019t think that will repeat at that level, but nonetheless, it\u2019s in the number. And so, you\u2019re already down that. So, we didn\u2019t carve that out as an adjusted item. That\u2019s in our core number. Some people adjust and some people don\u2019t. What we do is provide that and let you do what you want with it. But when we\u2019re giving you guidance is in our number -- in our core number. And so, those are the two big drivers -- we\u2019ve already given you guidance that our service charge number is likely to go down because we\u2019re going to offer up 24-hour grace, and we\u2019re not exactly sure what that will mean, but we\u2019ve taken an estimate, and we\u2019ve given you the $550 million for service charges and we\u2019ll update as we learn. But those are probably the big three. Stephen Scouten : Okay. Very helpful, David. And then I guess just one maybe high-level kind of question. I mean, it feels like your business model is really proving itself out right now. I mean, you\u2019re in just a phenomenal position from a deposit perspective and you\u2019ve diversified your loan book so much over the last few years. I guess, as you look at the environment today, is there anything you would have done differently or anything you would have structured differently, knowing what, I guess, we\u2019ve learned since March 8th or what have you? Or do you feel like you\u2019ve done what you would have wanted to do regardless? David Turner : Stephen, I think we really -- our core of our franchise are our customers and the people that work here, and we have a fabulous customer base, deposit base. We\u2019ve said that for many, many years, even when rates were zero -- virtually zero. And you didn\u2019t see the benefit of that. Rising rates and of course, having a liquidity challenges all proves the business model out. So, we certainly wouldn\u2019t change that, and we wouldn\u2019t change our focus on thinking of a customer on the right side of the balance sheet in the form of a checking account or an operating account, that\u2019s really worked well for us. We brought on some really talented people in our company, in particular, our technology area. We brought on some very good people in the revenue areas that are doing a great job for us. And so, I just think sticking to fundamentals of banking is what we\u2019ve done. That\u2019s what John has asked us to do. We\u2019re not trying to take big bets on anything. We\u2019re just trying to keep it down the fairway. And to me, steady as she goes, has been the way and may not be flashy, but it seems to be paying off for us. And I think if we just stay on that, soundness; profitability; and growth, those are the three words John asked us to use in that order. And if we stick to that, we\u2019re going to have a pretty good franchise. It\u2019s going to be less volatile than many of our peers and certainly less volatile than we used to be pre-crisis. So, I don\u2019t see a lot of change. We need to get better in leverage technology in some areas where we\u2019re using human capital, and that\u2019s just -- that\u2019s on the to-do list, and we\u2019re trying to get after it. John Turner : Thank you. Well, I know it\u2019s been a busy week for everybody. I appreciate your participation today, and thank you for your interest in Regions. We\u2019ll end the call. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation\u2019s Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed to listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question and answer portion. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2023 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, Regions delivered another solid quarter, underscoring our commitment to generating consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We generated earnings of $556 million resulting in earnings per share of $0.59 and one of the best return on average tangible common equity ratios in our peer group at 24%. Our consistent strong earnings performance has given the board confidence to increase the quarterly common stock dividend by 20%, which was officially reported in a press release earlier this week. Although some lingering economic uncertainty remains, we feel good about our ability to carry this momentum into the second half of the year. We continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, robust liquidity position, and prudent credit risk management. Our proactive hedging strategies have positioned us for success in any interest rate environment and our granular deposit base and relationship-based banking approach continue to serve us well. Overall, sentiment among our corporate customers remains relatively positive despite ongoing labor shortages, persistent inflationary pressure and slowly improving supply chain issues. In fact, most are continuing to forecast solid performance in 2023, although they are expecting modest declines from levels experienced in 2022. We remain committed to serving our customers while maintaining our focus on risk-adjusted returns. We are being judicious with capital, preserving it for our best clients and relationships. Year-to-date, the corporate bank has grown loans 2%, in line with our expectations with the vast majority of this growth coming from existing customers. Our consumer customers also remain healthy. Unemployment in 7 of our 8 top states remains at or near historical lows. And housing prices in 13 of our 15 states are forecast to outperform the HPI Index in 2023. Wages in much of our footprint have kept pace with or exceeded increases in inflation. And as a result, consumer deposit balances and credit card payment rates remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Our credit quality remains strong. Although normalization continues, charge-offs remain below historical through the cycle levels. We also continue to benefit from the strategic investments we are making in our business. For example, over the last few years, we focused on enhancing our treasury management suite of products and services. We have invested in talent and technology, including data and analytics, improving our ability to provide our clients with data-driven insights. Today, our relationship managers lead every prospective client conversation with a cash flow mindset, enabling us to clearly understand our customer needs. We are very pleased with the success of our treasury management business, which has produced 13% revenue growth year-over-year. Although our penetration rate for treasury management solutions ranks among the top versus peers, we continue to see further opportunity in our existing customer base, particularly in lowering the commercial. Additionally, during the second quarter, we introduced Regions\u2019 no-cost overdraft grace feature, giving consumers the opportunity to remedy overdrafts and avoid fees. To-date, the data indicates that customers are seeing an approximate 30% reduction in the occurrence of assessed fees. We are excited about the financial benefits and flexibility our customers are enjoying as a result of the changes we have made over the past 2 years. We also continue to actively search for investment opportunities with respect to mortgage servicing rights. And during the last 18 months, we have acquired the rights to service approximately $23 billion in mortgage loans through a combination of bulk purchases and flow deals. These are just a few examples of our commitment to investing in markets, technology, talent and capabilities that grow and diversify our revenue base and enhance offerings to our customers. Now, Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let\u2019s start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 1% sequentially. Average business loans also increased 1% reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across the telecommunications, multifamily and energy industries. Loan demand remained stable during the quarter and we had the opportunity to continue growing faster. However, as John mentioned, we are committed to appropriate risk-adjusted returns and now is not the time to stretch for growth. We are focused on supporting existing customers, where we have a relationship and proven history. Approximately, 84% of this quarter\u2019s business loan growth was driven by existing clients access and expanding their credit lines. Average consumer loans increased 1%, as growth in mortgage and Interbank was partially offset by declines in home equity and runoff exit portfolios. Looking forward, we expect 2023 ending loan growth of 3% to 4%. From a deposit standpoint, our deposit base remains a strength and a differentiating factor across the peer set with balances continuing to largely perform as expected. Our deposits are highly operational in nature, granular in size and generally receive more coverage through FDIC insurance than most peers. Although banking turmoil late in the first quarter introduced some additional uncertainty to the company\u2019s outlook, deposits largely performed as expected, ending the first half of the year down $4.8 billion. As part of our practice of maintaining a diversity of funding sources, total deposits include approximately $1 billion of deposits composed of brokered CDs and wholesale market transactions. Recall, this is in addition to the brokered CDs we acquired as part of the Interbank acquisition, which are maturing over time. Deposit declines came largely from higher balance and more rate-sensitive customers across all three businesses. We also saw continued diversification of customer dollars across various Regions offerings, such as from interest-free checking to CDs or money market deposits and movement out of deposits to offerings through our wealth management platform and in the corporate banking segment, utilization of off-balance sheet money market mutual fund solutions. In the case of corporate clients, overall liquidity under management has remained solid, increasing almost 3% since the end of the first quarter. Looking forward, a tightening Federal Reserve observed through increasing interest rates and reductions in the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, along with heightened competition will likely continue to constrain deposit growth for the industry through year end. Accordingly, we expect deposits to be modestly lower over the balance of the year and we expect the continued remixing into interest-bearing categories. So, let\u2019s shift to net interest income and margin. As expected, net interest income declined by 2.5% in the second quarter. This represents the beginning of a reversion elevated net interest income and margin levels back towards our longer term range, mostly due to deposit and funding cost normalization. Region\u2019s balance sheet remains asset sensitive. As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, the net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lower yielding loans and securities. At this stage in the rate cycle, we expect deposit cost increases through a continuation of repricing and remixing trends. Importantly, recent trends remain within our expectation. The cycle-to-date deposit beta is 26% and our guidance for 2023 is unchanged, a 35% cycle-to-date beta by year end. Longer term, deposit performance will be heavily influenced by the amount of time monetary policy remains tight. Deposit betas could ultimately exceed the 35% in 2024 assuming higher rates for water. Regardless, we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for Regions when compared to the broader industry. Net interest income is projected to grow between 12% and 14% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The midpoint of the range is supported using June 30 market forward interest rates or approximately 1 additional 25 basis point hike this year. Third quarter net interest income is expected to decline approximately 5% driven by continued deposit and funding cost normalization and the beginning of the active hedging period for a number of previously transacted forward starting received fixed swaps. The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of earnings stability in today\u2019s uncertain environment. Hedges added to-date create a well-protected net interest margin profile through 2025. While no meaningful hedging was transacted during the quarter, we continue to look for opportunities to add balance sheet protection beyond 2025 at attractive market rate levels. Since quarter end, we have added $1 billion of forward starting swaps and $500 million of forward starting rate collars, near recent highs that will become effective in 2026, 2027 and 2028. The resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our net interest margin is projected to remain at or above the midpoint of the range. Let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income increased 8% from the prior quarter as increases in capital markets and card and ATM fees were partially offset by declines in other categories. Total capital markets income increased $26 million. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets increased 3% sequentially driven primarily by growth in real estate capital markets, partially offset by declines in M&A fees, debt underwriting and loan syndication income. We had a negative $9 million CVA and DVA adjustment, reflecting credit spread tightening during the quarter. However, this was a $24 million improvement versus the first quarter. Card and ATM fees increased 7% driven by seasonally higher spend and transaction volume as well as a first quarter $5 million rewards reserve adjustment that did not repeat. Service charges declined slightly during the quarter. As John mentioned, we introduced our overdraft grace feature in mid-June. Based on our experience to-date, we now expect full year service charges of approximately $575 million. With respect to outlook, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 6% to 8% compared to 2022. Let\u2019s move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 8% compared to the prior quarter and includes the previously announced elevated operating losses related to check fraud. Excluding the approximately $80 million associated with incremental check fraud incurred this quarter, adjusted non-interest expenses remained relatively stable versus the prior quarter. We have effective countermeasures in place and losses have returned to normalized levels. Salaries and benefits decreased 2%, primarily due to lower payroll taxes and 401(k) expense. Partially offset by an entire quarter of annual merit increases and higher head count. The FDIC insurance assessment increase was driven by changes in various inputs, including normalized credit conditions and increases in average assets. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses in order to continue funding investments in our business, including optimizing square footage. As an example, this quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell two of our largest operations centers, totaling over 450,000 square feet. We will continue to refine our expense base, focusing on our largest categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. We expect full year 2023 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up approximately 6.5% and continue to expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs were 33 basis points in the quarter. Non-performing loans decreased while business service criticized loans and total delinquencies increased. Provision expense was $118 million or $37 million in excess of net charge-offs. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 2 basis points to 1.65% and the allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 332%. The allowance increased due primarily to normalizing credit, modest economic outlook changes and loan growth. Allowance for credit losses on the office portfolio increased from 2.2% in to 2.7%. Importantly, the single office loan on non-performing status is paying as agreed. Additionally, the vast majority of our office exposure is in Class A properties, located primarily within the Sunbelt. Overall, we continue to feel good about the composition of our office book and do not expect any meaningful loss in this portfolio. While we expect net charge-offs will continue to normalize over the back half of the year, we continue to expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be approximately 35 basis points. We also expect to return to our historical through-the-cycle annual charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points in 2024. From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 and ratio at an estimated 10.1%. Although we were not required to participate in this year\u2019s supervisory capital stress test, we did receive our preliminary stress capital buffer reflecting planned capital changes, including the dividend increase John referenced. Our preliminary stress capital buffer will remain at 2.5% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, we have access to sources of liquidity at June 30, totaling approximately $53 billion including collateral we have in a ready status at the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Bank term funding program and the discount window. These sources are sufficient to cover all retail uninsured deposits plus wholesale non-operational deposits by approximately a 3 :1 ratio. Given current macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory uncertainty, we anticipate continuing to manage capital levels at or modestly above 10% over the near-term. And finally, we have a slide summarizing our expectations which we have addressed throughout the prepared comments. With that, we will move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a little on the deposit pricing thoughts, so you kept the interest-bearing deposit beta assumption, which was great, but softened the deposit growth expectation a bit. Maybe a follow-up or two on how you are thinking about the balance between flows and pricing? And then when we think about that beta assumption potentially going higher into next year as you had suggested vis-\u00e0-vis the third \u2013 current 35% expectation, what are sort of the major puts and takes as you think about it? I mean, obviously sort of time is a big one, but would just be curious to hear your thoughts? David Turner : Sure. This is David. So with regards to deposit pricing, it\u2019s important that I understand that we think about our customers, we talk to our business leaders in terms of what we need to do to support our customer base and what\u2019s going on from a competitive landscape. And so through that we form an opinion as to what our deposit beta ought to be. And I would tell you that going into last quarter. We\u2019ve had 35% beta now for \u2013 since the beginning of the year. We had a little bit cushion in that, we believe, pretty conservative, based on what we\u2019ve seen and the competitive pressures that we\u2019ve seen and obviously, events of March 8. It\u2019s probably not as conservative. We believe it\u2019s the right number, but we don\u2019t have as much conservatism in it as we had. With regards to what we are thinking about beta going into 2024, we really need to understand what the Fed is thinking. And right now, if they have one more increase and kind of stay on hold for a while. You probably have a couple of quarters before betas stopped creeping up on you. So we had originally called for the end of the cycle at the end 2023 because this has been elongated a bit, the cycle is going to continue into 2024 to some degree. And that\u2019s all dependent on when they stop. And so if they have one more increase at the next meeting, it will be sooner if they keep going another increase after that, it will be later. So those are probably the biggest individual drivers. You have other things like competition, what we have to be competitive. And so what our competition does, we have to react to some degree. So that\u2019s another driver. And then the overall Fed balance sheet. So the Fed is down about $800 billion since the beginning of the year. The balance sheet is going to continue to drift down a little bit, which will take liquidity out of the system and put some pressure on there. So there are several things. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to be precise on what the beta is going to be. But I think there should be some expectation that there is a little bit of increase in 2024, the amount of which we can\u2019t tell you precisely, we will continue to look and search for that and update you as we change our opinion on that. Scott Siefers : Wonderful. Thank you very much. And then I wanted to ask just a super quick one on sort of the background behind the favorable $25 million adjustment you made to the expected full year service charges number. It sounds like it\u2019s simply a better understanding based on the early observations from the rollout of the new industry, but would love to hear any incremental color you have there as well, please? David Turner : Yes, it actually wasn\u2019t that. The driver is because our \u2013 what\u2019s embedded in the service charge is also treasury management. And our treasury management group has done a great job this year growing relationships were up about 9% or relationships. And if you look at revenue, our revenue on treasury management is up some 13%. And so we saw that happen in the first part \u2013 the first quarter. We want to see if it continued it did in the second quarter. And so our service charge from 24-hour grace is about what we where we forecasted it. So you add all that together and just on a run-rate basis, you can see we are going to be higher than what we had originally guided and that was the single driver. Scott Siefers : That\u2019s perfect. Alright. Thank you. Again, I appreciate you taking the questions. David Turner : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, John. Good morning, David. David Turner : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : David, can you share with us, I know we don\u2019t know what the final outcomes will be from the regulatory changes that are on the horizon possibly we get them next week. But can you share with us how you guys were thinking about how it might impact you in terms of the long-term debt portion of the TLAC as well as the higher risk-weighted asset assumptions possibly from mortgages, which came out, I think this week, any other issues that are surrounding this whole regulatory change that\u2019s on the horizon? David Turner : Sure. So let me just give you an overall comment then I will break down some of the elements. So overall, Gerard, what we are hearing, what we are seeing, we can \u2013 we will be able to adapt and overcome whatever it is that we have to. We think the Fed is going to give us all time to adapt to whatever those changes are going to be without any major disruption. So specifically on debt, we are hearing potentially a 6% of RWA number for those over $100 million. Maybe there is some tailoring, but let\u2019s just use the 6% for easy math. That\u2019s an incremental $5 billion of debt for us that we will have to raise over time. We will be able to leverage that $5 billion into our business and including putting some of it at the bank that will reduce our deposit insurance premium some. And when you wrap all that together, you are talking about 60 to 70 basis points of all-in cost for us on that $5 billion. So you\u2019re talking about $35 million bottom line hit if that were to happen, fully implemented. So it\u2019s just not \u2013 it\u2019s not something that\u2019s pretty easy to overcome. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, but we don\u2019t get to make the rules. We just have to adapt and overcome. With regards to the RWA, so we\u2019re hearing conflicting things. There is clearly some additional operational risk we\u2019re going to have to put into RWAs, we\u2019re supposed to get some benefit, though, on the credit side, whether it be from mortgages or investment grade. If all that happens like Basel intended, then it\u2019s a push and no big deal. On the other hand, if we don\u2019t get the benefits we\u2019re supposed to on the credit risk weights, then that will cost us a little bit of capital. And again, we will feather that in over time. Outside of Basel, but probably part of the MDR that will be coming out will be AOCI. AOCI is likely to be in the capital regime going forward, which, on a stress basis, actually is helpful because you\u2019re AOCIs in a gain position. But in a rising rate environment, which is good for banking because that\u2019s where we make most of our money. From a capital standpoint, you\u2019ll have to strip that AOCI in over time. Again, they are talking about starting maybe in 2025 or 2026 and then giving you 3 to 5 years to do that. And again, we can \u2013 we will be able to handle that. Some of that takes care of itself just because of the maturities of the investment portfolio and so \u2013 and then rates coming down the other way. So again, the bottom line is where I started, whatever it is, we will adapt and overcome. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then I think you guys mentioned that you sold a couple of operation centers or you\u2019re in agreement to sell a couple of operation centers. I didn\u2019t hear, are you going to vacate them as well? Or is it just more of a sales leaseback situation? And then second, the price you received for them, how does that compare to what they may have been valued a couple of years ago at? David Turner : Yes. So the first part is we will lease one of the buildings back some of the square footage for a relatively short period of time to help us transition. But for the most part, we\u2019re going to be vacating both of those buildings. I mean the world has changed since we built all of that. And so we just don\u2019t need to see. And of course, working remotely has been a piece of that, too. So we think it\u2019s a good deal, not only for our customer base, but for our community because what\u2019s going there, we think, will be very helpful to the community. We\u2019re going to be able to get out of sell that. It will be at write a book value to a slight gain on the sale, not anything to write home about, but we will make a little bit of money on that. Gerard Cassidy : And David was the values lower than what you think if you would have sold those 2 or 3 years ago? Just to tie into the whole commercial real estate lower values that we\u2019re hearing about. John Turner : Yes. Gerard, it\u2019s John. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a relevant question. We\u2019re selling to the taxing authority that \u2013 so we\u2019re selling to the city that we occupied and our tax valuation was unchanged over the 3-year period. And so it\u2019s based on tax valuation. So I\u2019m not sure that we can give you a good answer to your question. Gerard Cassidy : Got it, okay. No, I appreciate that, John. Thank you. John Turner : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning. David, just wondering your expectations for deposits to go down a little bit towards the end of the year, and you mentioned the additions of some of those brokered CDs. I\u2019m just wondering what you think of the trajectory for average earning assets from here, if the right size kind of coming down a little bit in loan growth, you\u2019ve kind of given your clear view of that and just wondering how that fits in with the securities and cash in between in terms of what AA does? David Turner : Yes. I think you\u2019ll see a modest decline there, Ken. I think the deposit decline normalization. Remember, we had a lot of surge deposits. We\u2019ve been calling for run off a bit. We were pretty close to our number through the second quarter. Rates are higher or longer. I think that\u2019s going to have some switching costs associated with it. There is going to be some off-balance sheet movement as well. We think our non-interest-bearing drifts down to that mid-30s, which is what we\u2019ve been calling for. I think today, we\u2019re at about 37%. So as a result of that decline, you should expect earning assets to decline along with that. When we talk about modestly, we\u2019re talking 1% to 2%, frankly. And \u2013 but we will see. We\u2019re continuing to grow checking accounts. The core of our franchise are checking accounts and operating accounts, and we are all over trying to grow that and take advantage of the markets that we\u2019re in, which is very favorable as we see the migration of people and businesses into our markets. So we think this is some more normalization and then we think it kind of settles out after that modest decline. Ken Usdin : Great. Okay. Got it. And just on the loan side, I was just wondering, resi mortgage and interbank have been the biggest parts of your loan growth for a while now. Just wondering, is that continue to be your expectation of where you\u2019ll get the majority of growth? And within that, I guess, if you can just give us an update on how interbank has been doing relative to your expectations. Thanks, David. David Turner : Sure. So our growth has really driven the far in total from the commercial side. That is going to slow a bit. We can just \u2013 as we talk to customers, we could see the demand for credit isn\u2019t quite what it was. Obviously, there are transactions that are harder to get done in real estate because we are based on the where rates are, we\u2019re requiring more equity in the deal and developers don\u2019t want to do that. So things don\u2019t happen. There is still a big demand for housing, our resi portfolio, we will continue to grow some. We have a good group of MLOs that are out there. The housing supply is still way below where it should be. Now rates are up. And so, that\u2019s going to \u2013 going to mute things. From an interbank standpoint, we\u2019ve had pretty good growth. They have met the expectations that we have laid out for them. We will see some slowing a bit in the second half and into 2024. We had a pretty big solar program going at one-time. The math on that got to a point where it was not as profitable as we had originally hoped for. And so we are not going to chase loan growth until \u2013 unless we can get paid appropriately for the risk that we take. As a result, that\u2019s going to slow a bit and interbank. That being said, we\u2019re very happy with what they are doing and you\u2019re going to see growth just not at the pace that we have had. Ken Usdin : Prefect. Great, thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Dave Rochester : Hey, good morning, guys. John Turner : Good morning. Dave Rochester : On your NII guide, I was just wondering about the timing of the rate hike you\u2019re factoring in there. It sounded like you\u2019re assuming July. I just wanted to confirm that. And then on your deposit comments you\u2019re factoring in that decline further on the GDA side and just overall. Just wondering what the rough average cost is of that incremental deposits that you\u2019re bringing in to replace some of that DDA? What\u2019s your assumption there? Is it 5%, 5.5%? Or is it closer to maybe some of your lower core accounts? David Turner : Yes, it\u2019s right at 5%. And you\u2019re correct, we did factor in the increase \u2013 rate increase in July. Dave Rochester : Okay. Great. Maybe on capital, the plan to manage CET1 at or slightly above 10%, given you\u2019re there now, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the changes of your restarting the buyback once you get more clarity on the capital requirements next week or do you think there is maybe a better possibility that you restart that 4Q? David Turner : It\u2019s probably more likely a 4Q. We keep thinking we\u2019re going to get clarification. We thought June 30 has been pushed out. So we don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019re going to get it. But whatever we do, we will shift through the material and we will come up with an appropriate plan. Until we know that plan, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. I mean we had, I think, the highest return this quarter on tangible common equity. There is just no need for us to push on the \u2013 to push on share buyback right now. Let\u2019s just be a little bit cautious and deal with the new rules. And then after that, if buying our shares back is appropriate, then that\u2019s what we will do. Dave Rochester : Okay. And maybe one, last one on credit. Just wanted to get your thoughts on your office reserve ratio at this point. I know you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the other office book out there in some of these other banks but we\u2019re just seeing reserve ratios that are a little bit more elevated at some of the larger banks. And I know you mentioned you don\u2019t expect any losses in that book. I was just hoping you could just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s giving you comfort with that the two handle that you\u2019ve got on there right now on the reserves? Thank you. John Turner : Sure, yes. This is John. I\u2019ll answer that. So our office portfolio is about $1.7 billion, roughly 36% of that portfolio is single tenant. And of that single tenant exposure, 82% is investment grade. So we sort of look at that $700 million and feel like we understand that. It\u2019s well secured, it\u2019s performing. So then we look at the $1 billion portfolio that remains that\u2019s multi-tenant, 63% of that is in the Sunbelt. Beyond that, it is well diversified geographically. Largest concentration we have is in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, where about 20% of the portfolio, our exposure actually resides. There are about 100 credits make up that $1 billion. So we have very good visibility into the relationships and to the performance of those particular credits. When I think about how we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve been talking to customers well in advance of maturities, and we have a fair number of maturities in 2023 and 2024. Performance to date has been good. We\u2019ve had 13 credits that have matured already this year and over half of those or half of those credits had an extension option, which they were able to exercise. Another 20% plus renewed based on our current credit underwriting standards and the balance either paid off. We have one credit that we\u2019re still working on. That\u2019s the one non-accrual that we have in the portfolio. And so all in all, our assessment of our portfolio, our office portfolio is pretty good. We have said we don\u2019t think we have any significant losses in the portfolio, and that\u2019s been confirmed by, again, conversations we\u2019re having with customers our visibility into what\u2019s occurred to date and what we think will occur over the next 12 to 18 months. Dave Rochester : Great. Thanks for all the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi, good morning. Can you guys just remind us where you are on the system upgrades on the loan and deposit platforms and what the benefits are once that\u2019s done? David Turner : Yes. So we are in the formative stage of putting in our new systems focusing on the deposit system. It will be the biggest and all of them are important to us, but that was really important to us. We are planning right now, we\u2019re laying the foundation. We are spending some money. We\u2019ve been spending money for quite some time. but you\u2019re not going to see benefits for a number of years, Matt. We\u2019ve got to go through. And we\u2019ve learned from talking to others that have gone through these type journeys is, it is much better to take your time and be planful. It will reduce \u2013 ultimately will reduce overall costs. So we\u2019re going through a number of customer journeys and really thinking through not just putting in a new system, but how can we really transform, how we do business and how can we make it easier for our customers to bank with us, how we can make it easier for our associates to take care of our customers. And so it\u2019s a lot of work. And so you\u2019re going to see cost upfront which is what we\u2019re experiencing today before you\u2019ll see the benefits, it will be a few years out. Matt O\u2019Connor: And remind us of the time line, I think it was back in 2019, you first started talking about it, I thought you said it might be 5 or 6 years, but update us on the time line, please? David Turner : That\u2019s right. It\u2019s going to be \u2013 you\u2019re another 5 years from now before you see this. So we have a deposit system, we will be putting in a new commercial loan system, and we will be putting in a consumer loan system as well. But the biggest \u2013 biggest one and the most expensive one will be the deposit system. But that\u2019s at least 3 years out before that gets put in. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Quick question. Question is clarifying sort of the statements on NII, David. So based on your guidance, the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income quote exit rate will be somewhere between $1.31 billion and $1.32 billion. Sort of based on what you\u2019re telling us, should we expect perhaps a step down in the first quarter due to day count. And like you said, the continuation of beta creep, but then would there be stability from there or an opportunity for reprice if the Fed cuts? I\u2019m trying to just triangulate your comments on NIM, which are very helpful to the NII quarterly cadence. David Turner : Yes. So I won\u2019t confirm your number exactly, but your thinking is spot on that as we get to the end of the year, we start stabilizing a bit. The question is, where does the Fed stop. If they go one more time and stop then you\u2019re \u2013 then the only thing you really have leading into the first quarter will be slight beta risk and the day count that you talked about. So I think you have stability from there on. However, if the Fed continues to push this out even more and has to go two, three \u2013 two more hikes, three more hikes and you just push everything out. We do have hedges that are becoming live this quarter. You can see that on our Page 6 at our deck. And so we put those on over a year ago with anticipation that there was risk that rates actually roll over and start going down, they didn\u2019t. And so we will be into a negative carry on those, which is okay because the rest of our book is earning a whole lot more money than we thought at the time. So that\u2019s all been factored into the guidance that we gave you. And we\u2019re, right now, we\u2019re expecting that we get to the end of the year and things really start to settle out with the exception of minor tweaks in that first quarter. Erika Najarian : Got it. And could you remind us sort of how much in total is the check fraud is you have in your expense base for 2023 and as we think about your natural growth [indiscernible] run-rate? David Turner : Yes. So we have a schedule in our supplement on it. Let me see if I can find it real quick for you because we were anticipating this question. We wanted to give everybody an understanding. It\u2019s on Page 15 of the supplement. And it\u2019s embedded in the operational loss number, and that change related to check fraud, was about $80 million, as we mentioned in the call. But you can see our operational losses had averaged about $13 million to $18 million per quarter, and we are back to that kind of run rate now. And so we expect to be there about that number going forward. Erika Najarian : Got it. And if I could just squeeze one more in, and this is for John. We\u2019re sitting here now July 21, 2023, and your firm is in a position of great strength. I\u2019m wondering \u2013 and I\u2019m asking about organic opportunities. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrapping an M&A question around this. But as you think about to go on more stringent RWA diet, than you given where your capital is today, how are you thinking about playing offense as we think through all the changes. How do you leverage that deposit base that will stay inexpensive and the capital that seems to be building nicely in the credit that seems relatively stable. John Turner : Erica, we\u2019re continuing to add talent. So we\u2019re continuing to hire talent. We\u2019re in some very good markets. We have acquired a number of capabilities over the last number of years. And so it\u2019s really combining talent with opportunity in markets with additional capabilities, just to execute our plan. We\u2019re asking our bankers to be active in markets, talking to customers and non-customers looking for ways to expand our business while there is still some economic uncertainty, and we want to be prudent and careful. We start with soundness first, followed by profitability and then growth. We think we are in a position, as you pointed out to win market share, where opportunities exist and we\u2019re focused on those prospects that we\u2019ve been calling on for a long time. And relationships that we\u2019ve had for a long time to ensure that we use the capital and the resources we have to support those companies as they want to grow their businesses. David Turner : Yes, Erika, this is David. Let me add to that. So we do realize there could be opportunities for us to grow loans faster than what we just gave you the guidance on. So we gave a guidance of 3% to 4%. We produced that slightly because of the demand that I had talked about earlier. We want to grow relationships. We aren\u2019t interested in taking advantage of somebody\u2019s RWA diet and growing loans only. We cannot outstrip our funding base because that marginal profitability just won\u2019t be there if you\u2019re having to hope self-fund that growth. So if we can get a relationship that brings an operating account and other deposits, we\u2019re all over that. But we\u2019re not interested in just growing loans because somebody else wants to shed that risk. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. John Turner : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Yes, just a ticky-tacky one at this stage. AOCI, Pulsar, what should we be thinking about with regard to how that\u2019s going to pull quarterly over the next four, six quarters? David Turner : Yes. I think we have a schedule in the back is on our Slide #17 that shows by the end of 2024, about 25% of that will be rolled in and then by the end of the next year, about 39%. That\u2019s using just maturities in the forwards at this time. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And that\u2019s on just the AFS book, obviously, right? David Turner : That\u2019s correct. Betsy Graseck : And then your strategy for the security portfolio in general, are you going to be adding to it over time or what are you doing with the excess deposit growth that you get? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So we\u2019ve historically been 18% to 20% of our earning assets and securities. We suspect we will be roughly in that range. What we have to think through is what the new regime will be with regards to AOCI. As you\u2019re probably aware, the AOCI changes with regards to securities becomes part of your capital, but the fair market value changes with regards to derivatives is not. And so what that does is it causes you to at least think about, if we need the duration protection that we use our securities book for along with liquidity. That perhaps we use more derivatives than securities. And we will just have to see. But I don\u2019t see that changing our securities book appreciably Will it be down a notch or two perhaps. But I don\u2019t think you \u2013 you should expect us to grow that book much past that 20% range. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Alright, thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : Good morning. John Turner : Good morning. David Turner : Good morning. John Pancari : Back to the deposit beta. I know you indicated the potential for an increase in 2024 of rates hemin elevated. Any way to help us size it up, and does the 35 to 40, is that most likely if we are in a higher longer environment? Or could it be up there where some of your competitors are flagging in the mid-40s and maybe even up there in the 50s where some of them are at. Just curious if you can help us frame it out? Thanks. Unidentified Company Representative : Hey, John, this is Darren Smith. I\u2019ll take that one. So I think you\u2019re in the right neighborhood. Our expectations would be that if the Fed is indeed done over the next couple of meetings. And then what you\u2019re seeing is just that residual beta creep that plays out over a couple of quarters, and then you have very modest increases from there. It obviously depends on how long we\u2019re at that level. But I think somewhere in the upper 30s to around 40% is reasonable in terms of how much it may continue to move. John Pancari : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. And then separately, just back to O\u2019Connor\u2019s question on the systems conversion. Can you remind us your expectation around the cost of the conversion? I know you had originally indicated that you don\u2019t expect it to impact your IT budget. Is that still the case or has it \u2013 has that changed as you have named it on the vendor, etcetera? Thanks. David Turner : Yes. So John, we\u2019re still in the formative stage of planning for that. I\u2019ll tell you there is a lot of things going on other than this \u2013 the system integration with regards to technology. The environment is changing to Software as a Service versus buying a system and capitalizing it depreciating that over time and skipping several of the upgrades because you don\u2019t want to pay for that. Today, it\u2019s all going in the cloud. It\u2019s paying by the drink and that\u2019s more expensive. And it\u2019s \u2013 the technology cost, it used to be technology costs go down over time. It does not appear to be the case. We\u2019re going to do our best to control that while making appropriate investments in technology because I think we can leverage that better than we do today. We use a lot of human capital to do things. I think over time, you\u2019re going to see most everybody leveraging technology better. And so I think that right now, we\u2019re at 9% to 11% of total revenue. I can see that drifting higher a bit over time. But right now, that\u2019s our call of 9% to 11%. And we will update you as things change. John Pancari : And then 9% to 11% of the total IT budget? David Turner : All technology, yes. John Pancari : Right, got it. Okay, thank you, David. David Turner : You bet John. John Turner : Okay. Well, I think that\u2019s all the calls. So I appreciate everybody\u2019s participation today. Thank you for your interest in Regions. Have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $465 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.49. And while we have some unusual items in our results this quarter, our core performance remains strong, and we continue to have one of the best return on average tangible common equity ratios in our peer group at 21%. During the quarter, we continued to experience elevated levels of check-related fraud. Our third quarter results reflect an incremental $53 million in losses stemming from a second fraud scheme, which also began in the second quarter, but was unknown to us at the time. This scheme manifested itself in delayed returns, and as a result, has had a much longer tail. After adjusting our countermeasures to identify potential fraud instances more quickly, the volume of new fraud claims has slowed. Although difficult to project, based on what we know today, we expect quarterly fraud losses to come down significantly and to be approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter. Based upon the increases we are seeing in check fraud across the industry, in fact, based on data we have, we indicate losses are up about 40% year-over-year. We expect future fraud losses to normalize in the $25 million per quarter range in 2024. Although the industry faces headwinds from lingering economic and regulatory uncertainty, we continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet with solid capital, robust liquidity, and prudent credit risk management. Our proactive hedging strategies have positioned us for success in any interest rate environment. And our granular deposit base and relationship banking approach continue to serve us well. We spent over a decade de-risking our balance sheet and are well positioned to manage the proposed regulatory changes without significant impact to our business model. We remain committed to appropriate risk-adjusted returns, and now is not the time to stretch for growth.  We are focused on supporting existing customers where we have a relationship and a proven history. We have a great team with a proven track record of executing our strategy with focus and discipline. I'm confident in our ability to adapt to the changing regulatory and economic landscape, while continuing to generate top quartile returns through the cycle. Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. Within the business portfolio, average loans were stable, while ending loans decreased 1%. As John mentioned, we are being judicious in reserving our capital for business where we can have a full relationship.  Client sentiment varies across industries with some continuing to expect growth, while others have a more muted outlook. Commercial commitments are down 1% compared to the second quarter. Average and ending consumer loans increased 1% as growth in mortgage and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and runoff exit portfolios.  Subsequent to quarter-end, we executed a sale of our remaining GreenSky portfolio of approximately $300 million, which represents one of our consumer exit portfolios. The economics of the transaction are relatively neutral, but will create approximately 14 basis points of incremental charge-offs in the fourth quarter, offset by the related reserve release. Looking forward, we expect 2023 ending loan growth to be in the low single digits.  From a deposit standpoint, the modest deposit declines were in line with expectations, largely driven by late cycle rate-seeking behavior. We continue to experience remixing out of non-interest bearing or NIB products and ended the quarter with NIB representing 35% of total deposits.  Given the current rate environment, we expect the percentage to ultimately level off in a low 30% range. While some customers find alternatives in other investment channels outside of regions, many are moving to our CDs and money market accounts. We also continue to provide off-balance sheet opportunities through our wealth management platform and in the corporate banking segment via money market mutual fund solutions.  In the case of corporate clients, overall liquidity under management has remained stable quarter-over-quarter. Acquisition and retention of high primacy and operating relationships are strong, reflecting our focus to sustain and extend our deposit advantage through cycles.  Looking forward, the higher rate environment, a tightening Federal Reserve, and heightened competition will likely continue to constrain deposit growth and pressure costs for the industry through year-end and into early 2024. Accordingly, we expect deposits to be stable, to modestly lower in the fourth quarter, and we expect continued remixing into interest bearing categories.  So let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income declined by 6.5% in the third quarter, reflecting the anticipated normalization from elevated net interest income and margin levels back towards a sustainable longer term range. The decline is driven by deposit cost normalization, the start of the active period on $6 billion of incremental hedging, as well as a one-time leverage lease residual value adjustment.  As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lower yielding loans and securities. Deposit costs continue to increase through a combination of re-pricing and remixing, increasing the cycle to-date interest bearing deposit beta to 34%.  Historically, this behavior persists for a few quarters after the Fed stops moving interest rates. While we expect the pace of re-pricing to moderate, a higher federal funds rate over an extended period will cause remixing from low cost deposits to persist, ultimately pushing deposit betas higher than previously anticipated. We now project the cycle to-date beta to increase to near 40% by year-end.  Regardless, we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for regions when compared to the broader industry. If the Fed remains on hold, fourth quarter net interest income is expected to decline approximately 5%, driven by continued deposit and funding cost normalization and the beginning of the active hedging period on another $3 billion of previously transacted forward starting swaps. Net interest income is projected to grow approximately 11% in 2023 when compared to 2022.  As we look to 2024, higher rates for longer likely extends the period of deposit cost and mix normalization. We expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year.  The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of earning stability in today's uncertain environment. Hedges added to date create a net interest income profile that is well protected and mostly neutral to changes in interest rates through 2025. While we do not anticipate adding any point to the hedging position over the coming quarters, we continue to look for opportunities to add protection at attractive rate levels in outer years through the use of derivatives or securities. During the third quarter, we added $1.5 billion of forward starting swaps and $500 million of forward starting rate collars.  Let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 2% from the prior quarter, as modest increases in mortgage and wealth management income were offset by declines primarily in service charges and capital markets. The increase in mortgage income was driven by higher servicing income associated with a bulk purchase of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans closed early in the quarter. Service charges declined 7%, reflecting the run rate impact of the company's overdraft grace feature implemented late in the second quarter. Based on our experience to-date, as well as our expectation for another record year in treasury management, we now expect full year service charges of approximately $590 million.  Total capital markets income decreased $4 million. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets income decreased 13% sequentially, as increases in M&A fees were offset by declines in other categories. We had a negative $3 million CVA and DVA adjustment during the quarter versus the $9 million negative adjustment in the prior quarter. With respect to the outlook, we now expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 5% to 6% compared to 2022.  Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter and includes the previously noted elevated operational losses. Excluding the incremental fraud experienced in both the second and third quarters, adjusted non-interest expenses increased 1% sequentially. Salaries and benefits decreased 2%, driven primarily by lower incentives and payroll taxes, while other non-interest expense increased 12%, driven primarily by a $7 million pension settlement charge.  We remain committed to prudently managing expenses in order to fund investments in our business. We will continue to refine our expense base, focusing on our largest categories, which includes salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend.  We expect full year 2023 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 9.5%. Excluding the $135 million of incremental operational losses experienced in the past two quarters, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to be up approximately 6% in 2023 when compared to 2022. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 40 basis points due to elevated charge-offs related to a solar program we've since discontinued at EnerBank, as well as lower commercial recoveries versus the second quarter. Non-performing loans, business services criticized loans, and total delinquencies also increased. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans increased 15 basis points in the quarter due primarily to a large collateralized information credit.  Provision expense was $145 million or $44 million in excess of net charge-offs. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 5 basis points to 1.70%, while the allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans declined to 261%. The increase to our allowance is due primarily to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization, as well as a build in qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain portfolios, including office, multifamily and select markets and EnerBank. It's also worth noting the outcome of the most recent Shared National Credit Exam is reflected in our results. The allowance on the office portfolio increased from 2.7% to 3.1%. Importantly, the vast majority of our office exposure is in Class A properties located primarily within the Sunbelt and non-Gateway markets. Overall, we continue to feel good about the composition of our office book and do not expect any meaningful loss in this portfolio. We expect net charge-offs will continue to normalize, including this quarter's charge-offs, but excluding the 14 basis point impact on our fourth quarter GreenSky loan sale, we expect full year 2023 adjusted net charge-off ratio to be slightly above 35 basis points.  In the third quarter, two anticipated notices of proposed rulemakings were issued. While we plan to provide feedback through the comment process on both, we are well positioned to absorb the ultimate impacts without major changes to our business.  With respect to Basel III end-gain, as proposed, we estimate a low to mid-single digit increase in risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach in addition to the phase-in of AOCI into regulatory capital. Regarding minimum long-term debt, we estimate a need to issue approximately $6 billion of long-term debt over the course of several years. We view this amount to be manageable, resulting in a modest drag on earnings.  Importantly, the proposal provides clarity on the evolution of the regulatory environment and supports our decision to maintain our common equity Tier 1 ratio around 10% over the near term, as this level should provide sufficient flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation timeline, while supporting strategic growth objectives.  Despite the current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the continued evolution of the regulatory framework, we expect that share repurchases will resume in the near term.  And finally, we have a slide summarizing our expectations, which we have addressed throughout the prepared comments. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Please hold while we compile the Q&A roster. Thank you. Our first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start out just on the NII trajectory. When we talk about NII stabilizing in the first half of the \u201924, I guess, we might be suggesting that it could continue to compress a bit after the fourth quarter's dip. So maybe just thinking if you can help us to sort of size any potential pressure beyond year-end \u201823, and then additionally your thoughts on what would allow it to resume growing in the second half of next year. David Turner : Yes. Hey Scott. This is David. So you're right. You will see some pressure in the fourth quarter in particular as we see continued remixing of non-interest bearing deposits going into interest bearing, given higher for longer rates. And due to the fact that we have $3 billion of notional interest rate swaps that become live in the fourth quarter, that alone cost about $20 million in NII. So you'll see an adjustment, not as big as you just saw relative to net interest margin decline, but you'll see some decline in the fourth quarter.  When we get to the third quarter, while we do have an additional $2.5 billion of interest rate swaps that become live then, we think the remixing will start slowing. We think there is somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion worth of remixing of non-interest bearing deposits into interest bearing, and that's going back into study in our consumers in particular, and how much they had in their accounts relative to their spend. And where that $3 billion to $5 billion gets you back to where they were from a pre-pandemic standpoint.  So we have confidence that we should see this starting to slow after the fourth quarter. There'll be, like I said, a little pressure in the first quarter because of the new derivatives coming on. That number will affect us about $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter, then we don't have any more after that. So we start stabilizing from there. When we get to the second half of the year, we can start to grow.  If I kind of cut to the chase on the end game, we think after all is said and done, we can support \u2013 our margin should bottom out around $3.50, perhaps a bit higher than that. So you're not going to see the kind \u2013 you can't take the change that you just saw and continue to extrapolate that all the way through the end of the second quarter. You'll have a bigger change in the fourth, a smaller change in the first and negligible change in the second quarter. So the balance sheet, what's important in all that is the balance sheet continues to re-price. We have about $15 billion worth of fixed rate securities and loans that re-priced. And the front book, back book impacts are about 250 basis points and we continue to have had that. The problem is it's been overwhelmed by the move of non-interest bearing deposits into interest bearing. And as I just mentioned, that should start to slow. And so I think, again, our margin bottoming out, kind of in that $3.50 just slightly better than that, is really the relevant point here. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that color. And then I guess just on the notion of deposits and betas. I know we're thinking about a 40% beta through the end of the year, but maybe thoughts on how things could trend into next year if we indeed have just sort of some drag on price. How much more pressure could we see once rates peak? How might that level off? David Turner : Yeah, I think so what's baked into what I just told you is that we would have a beta through the end of this year pushing on 40%, maybe a little underneath that. And then we go into perhaps the mid-40s into next year. And again, that's considering higher for longer. It starts to slow there, again, because we don't have as much moving out of non-interest bearing into interest bearing. So I think the \u2013 again, if we have rates even that continue to go up, we're slightly asset sensitive, and the re-pricing of our balance sheet starts to overwhelm the deposit moves, and I think that's a piece that people might not be picking up on. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right, wonderful. Thank you very much. David Turner : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. David Turner : Good morning. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. David Turner : Hey. Ryan Nash : Maybe to ask a question on credit, first, maybe just to clarify the implied a little bit above 35 for the year, which I guess implies around 45 for the fourth quarter. So that push is reported up to about 60 with GreenSky. Just wanted to verify that.  And then, can you expand on the comments regarding what you're seeing in office, multifamily, and maybe what happened with EnerBank, which I think you referenced higher charge-offs and exiting some parts of the portfolio? David Turner : Yeah. So, you want me to start? John Turner : Yeah. David Turner : So yeah, I think that we'll see some increase. So, let's keep the GreenSky piece out, because that's going to be noise. We kind of announced that separate. Go back to kind of core charge-offs, we said it would be slightly higher than 35. Call that a couple of points, maybe 37, which implies a fourth quarter in that 40 basis point charge-off range. We will continue to see elevated charge-offs coming through EnerBank, for which we provided this past quarter, relative to our program that we discontinued, and so we'll see that for a quarter or two, and that's factored into the guidance that we've given you.  From an office standpoint, our office continues to decline. Even in October, I think we put that in our notes. John Turner : Outstanding continues to decline, the quality of the portfolio. David Turner : Outstanding, sorry. John Turner : Maybe I'll speak to that. With respect to office, we've got about $1.6 billion in outstandings. To David's point, that represents some decline, pay downs, refinances over the course of the last quarter.  As we said before, about 39% of that portfolio is in credits direct to single-tenant credits, and the bulk of that is to investment-grade quality tenants. The balance of our exposure, 61-plus percent are in multi-tenant credits, 63% of that is in the Sunbelt market, 92% is Class A, we have in total about 100 borrowers. So we are very much on top of the portfolio, having ongoing conversations with customers.  About 50% of our exposure matures this year and in 2024, so we're actively working that. One of the, I think, good signs about the portfolio is that sponsors have contributed over the course of the last couple of quarters, over $150 million to the projects. Most of them are unguaranteed. So those are commitments that sponsors are making to the continued renewal extension of those projects, the right sizing of them. And as a consequence, we feel good about our office exposure. We have one non-accrual, and that credit has been renegotiated and is paying as agreed currently.  With respect to \u2013 yeah\u2026 [Multiple Speakers] David Turner : Sorry John, go ahead. John Turner : Yeah, the rest of the portfolio, we did see some uptick in non-accruals. As David said, we're still guiding to 35 to 45 basis points of loss in 2024. We feel good about that. I think the portfolio is performing as we expected, as it normalizes, and that's occurring.  Within EnerBank, we have a specific program that was associated with a single vendor, and it effectively was what I'll call kind of a buy now, pay later program, where the customer entered into an agreement to put solar equipment on their house. There was a period of time when that equipment would be installed on the house. The customer did not make any payments. We exited that program in October of 2022 just based on our analysis of the risk-adjusted returns associated with it and the profile of the product. It was just not something we wanted to continue.  Well, now we're beginning to see those loans reach a point where customers are having to make payments, and we are experiencing a little higher level of losses. But the losses with EnerBank are still below our expectations for EnerBank in general, and it continues to perform better than \u2013 at least consistent with, if not better than we had hoped when we made the acquisition. Ryan Nash : Got it. David, maybe a follow-up on expenses. I know there's lots of moving pieces in this scenario. I know you've highlighted that you guys have been doing work on it for a while, but just given the revenue headwinds that you're likely to face in the beginning of the year, can you maybe just talk about what you're doing? And while I know you might not be ready to give \u201824 guidance, do you think you could potentially hold the line on expenses and keep them relatively flat given the challenging revenue environment into \u201824? Thanks. A - David Turner : Yeah, so I don't think it should be a surprise to anybody that revenue is going to be challenging. That's been out there for a while. We've known it, and as a result, we started working on our expense management and our continuous improvement program throughout 2023.  In this particular quarter, unfortunately, we had some things that, the fraud, pension settlement, we had some equipment and software costs that won't repeat at the level that we had, and some professional fees that we incurred that we don't think will be repeated.  That being said, we're going to need to even double down on expense management for 2024. We're not going to give you guidance for that, but I think suffice it to say, our reported number that we have for 20 -- we should be able to have our number in 2024 to be underneath our reported number for 2023. How much, we'll give you guidance as we get towards the end of the year, but yeah, I think we can -- we should be able to be underneath that number. John Turner : I'll just add, Ryan, we've demonstrated I think over time, a commitment to effectively manage expenses, and it's our intention to continue doing that. We realize the importance of it. Ryan Nash : I appreciate all the color. A - David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. A - David Turner : Hey, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Good morning. On the fraud costs, if you could give us a little bit more color on that. Were they running higher than expected, than you had expected when you discussed them last quarter? And why are they \u2013 have they been persistent given the issue that you discovered?  And also that $25 million per quarter of fraud costs that you flagged for 2024, is that brand new or was that already to a degree baked into your run rate expectation as you look at 2024, or is this brand new, given the longer than expected persistence of this issue? David Turner : Yeah. So, let me answer the second question first. So the $25 million per quarter is slightly higher than our historical run rate. Fraud has increased dramatically in the industry. We seem to be the ones calling out. It's hit us very hard.  To your first question, this was a different scheme this time than what we've reported on last quarter. And unfortunately, this scheme that they had, you don't know about until the banks on which the checks are written notify you that that's not a good item, and it takes about 50 to 60 days before you know that.  We can look at when events occurred, and we can kind of see a pattern where we feel reasonably confident that we're not going to see that kind of increase going forward from the schemes that we've seen. And of course, we're putting in new controls, we're putting in new technology, and it's very disappointing. We have the 25 John, a bit higher. Call it $5 million higher than we historically have had, because this is just a big deal in the industry and so we want to be a bit conservative. We'll give you better guidance on expenses, including fraud, when we get to reporting on 2024 expectations later, but \u2013 so it's a tad higher, but. John Pancari : Okay. All right, David. Thank you. And then I guess related to that, any \u2013 I mean given this is the second visible fraud issue to come up in as many quarters, are you getting any pressure incrementally from regulators to invest more actively like you said, around these new controls that you're putting in or any input there?  And then separately, on the capital front, you talk about buybacks likely to resume in the near term. Can you maybe give us some color on the timing and potential magnitude there? David Turner : Sure. So we won't talk about our relationships with our regulators, but fraud is our issue. If we have to have our regulators tell us what to do with regards to fraud or anything else, we've probably already missed that boat. So it's not a \u2013 that's not an issue.  We're highly disappointed in it. We're working hard. We have found some people that have committed fraud. They've been put in jail. But it's again, the industry report we saw is up from $17 billion in \u201822 to $25 billion of fraud in \u201824 thus far. So it's \u2013 and \u201823, sorry. So it's affecting all of us, but it seems to have gotten us at a kind of concentrated in these two quarters. And again, I feel confident we put in controls and we'll be putting in more and monitoring it going forward.  Relative to capital, yeah, so we're at 10.3 on common equity tier one. We now have seen the Basel-III end-game proposal. We'll be going through and providing our comment letter on that, as well as that NPR. We feel confident in kind of where we are relative to that and the implementation timeframe. Hopefully we get a bit of reprieve on that. But even if we didn't, we feel that we're in a good place to be able to implement that without too much harm, and there's no need for us to continue to let our capital to continue to increase. We accrete 20, 30 basis points of capital every quarter. So if we did nothing, we would be pushing on 10.6, that's just higher than we need. And so we think we can enter into buybacks as soon as we get out of the blackout period. And what we left in our comments was we would operate close around that 10% CET1 number. John Pancari : Great. Thanks David. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Hey Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess, thanks for the color on CRE office. Just was wondering if you can talk about anything beyond CRE office, particularly on multifamily in any of the Sunbelt states. We've read articles about just oversupply in some of these markets like Raleigh, Austin, etc. Just talk to us, one, in terms of exposure, and if whether or not you're seeing softness with multifamily. John Turner : So Ebrahim. This is John Turner. Our total exposure I think in multifamily exceeds just above $3 billion. It is a very diverse portfolio spread across 137 total sub markets, some number like that. We are in terms of concentrations, our top five exposures would be in cities that you would recognize; Dallas, Houston, Charlotte, Raleigh, Orlando, Miami, places where we have just historically banked and have a presence. We don't have any concentrations at all in any of those markets that would exceed. I think one exception would exceed 5%, 6%, so again, good diversity. We are seeing some softening of rents, increasing costs associated with interest costs. About a little over 50% of the portfolio is currently still under construction. So we expect that those construction projects to be completed over the next 24 months to deliver out. We're not \u2013 while we're watching it closely, we really haven't seen any adverse movement within the portfolio to speak of. And again, given the location of our projects which are in suburban markets, given the diversity of the distribution across geographies and the location primarily in the Sunbelt, we feel good about our multifamily portfolio. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just a separate question in terms of the deposit beta outlook that you mentioned. How are you thinking about this in terms of the mix of customers? One, are you seeing consumer that's being depleted because of usage and that's driving deposit NIB or deposits low? Talk about that to some extent. Then, where do you see CDs shaking out in terms of impact from borrowers, from deposit customers and where CD mix could be 12 months from now if we don't get any rate cuts? Thanks. David Turner : Yeah, you were breaking up there a little bit, but I think you were saying, what are we seeing in terms of movement of NIB into CDs?  So that's been the big change thus far for us. I think our CDs are right at 10%, just under 10% of our book, of our total deposit book. That could grow. We do have money market offers that we're working on. We want to be competitive.  This remix has been really relegated to high net worth customers that are taking excess cash and putting it to work. And the reason we think that that remix is somewhere in the three to five to go is because that customer base gets down to having the amount of cash in their account relative to the spin pattern that they had pre-pandemic. And so I think that happens by the end of next year \u2013 I mean, the middle of next year.  As we think about where CD balances could be as a percentage of total deposits, maybe you pick up another 2% or 3% through that remix. And it really is dependent on how we think about other offers, money market, and we're working on that. So there could be some mix in terms of how that 3% to 5% gets put to work, but specific to CDs, 2% to 3%. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, David. Hey, John. Just a quick question on the B side. Clear guidance for the fourth quarter. Just those service charges continue to come in much better, $590 million for the year. Obviously, an implied lower exit for the fourth quarter. Any line of sight in terms of like, are we getting close to the leveling out period here on that service charges line in terms of, I know cash management has been outgrowing the other pieces, but is this kind of the right level of use going forward? David Turner : Yeah, I think from a fee standpoint, let's break down the two big pieces. So our service charge number relative to our 24 hour grace, that was implemented in the middle of the second quarter. So we have a full quarter run rate on that. We don't see that changing materially. We've been very proud of our treasury management team. They have done a good job of penetrating our commercial base and we\u2019re seeing that hold up pretty well. So I don't think you should see the kind of decline in service charges that you just saw. The only thing that can affect us in fees would be, there's a discussion going on with debit interchange and there's been percentages thrown out as to what that may mean just to level set with everybody. We have about $310 million of debit per year. So whatever percentage change we have, you can do your own math on that. We're not sure that that will even come out, but that's been mentioned and so we thought -- I thought I'd just put that out there. Ken Usdin : Yeah, that's fair. And David, can I just come back on that capital point? You're comfortably in that 10 plus zone and there's obviously not a lot of current growth in the loan book. So just the push and pull of potentially reengaging in the buyback versus just keeping where you are in a more uncertain environment. Kind of just walk us through just what would be your thought process there? David Turner : Sure. So as you know, we do an awful lot of stress testing. We do it constantly. We have our CCAR submission. We have a midyear submission. We feel very confident that even if we go into a recession, which we are not calling for, but even if we did, that we'd have capital to withstand that.  So, it's all about optimization Ken, and we think that \u2013 we still believe our operating range of 925 to 975 is the right range for regions based on our risk profile.  That being said, we've had an NPR. We have uncertainty going on. So we added 50 basis points to give us the flexibility to adapt and overcome whatever environment is thrown at us. We don't see the need to take 10.3 and let it ride up to 10.6, 10.9 and keep going and so that's what gives us confidence.  We don't have a big CRE book like others do. We don't have the risk that some others do. And we have a very good engine. Our PPNR engine is among the strongest because of our deposit profile that we have. And so we have confidence that our earnings stream is going to get us where we need to be, and we think that we have enough capital right now. So if we generate more, we can buy our stock back. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. David, my first question is for you. I feel like given the reaction of the stock, I think it's probably best to completely de-risk consensus numbers, right. So forgive me for asking a super specific question, but based on the disclosure of the swap book and everything that you're telling us about deposit behavior and hire for longer, it seems like you could hit that sort of 3.50 trough in the first quarter, kind of stay there, maybe go up a little bit and then get towards 3.6, if not a little bit over 3.6 by 4Q \u201823. So that gives you sort of a full year of let's call it between 3.5 and 3.55 for a \u201824. Again, based on the forward curve, based on slow growth. Does that feel fair? David Turner : I think you're pretty good at math. I don't know if that's \u2013 you've nailed exactly. John Turner : We're not giving any guidance. David Turner : We\u2019ve not given any guidance. You've done pretty well. You're understanding exactly how this works in terms of a bigger down draft in the fourth quarter than you'll see in the first part of the year and then be able to grow from there. So directionally, you're exactly right. Erika Najarian : Got it. And I'll follow-up with David [inaudible] with the balance sheet later, because I do want to ask the second question to John. I think, I guess what was surprising to me is that you had like a BNPL solar thing to begin with, right. So Regions has done a great job at not only convincing investors that it's completely changed in terms of the writing and risk management, but also that in the numbers.  And I guess this is a two part question. Number one, as you think about an uncertain macro head, do you feel like you've sort of fully captured like things like that, the BNPL solar that you're now discontinuing that may not be something that you would normally do under your risk management profile?  And maybe the follow-up question to that is the 35, 45 basis points. I think a lot of investors are thinking about a mild recession in 2024. Maybe it just feels like for bank investors versus other types of investors. But in that case, where would Regions peak in a mild recession relative to that 35, 45 basis point range for next year? John Turner : I think the answer to your first question is yes, to anything that we're \u2013 we feel like we've been through our portfolios, certainly been through the new businesses we've acquired and any products or programs that don't meet our risk and return profiles we've exited.  And in the case of this particular program, as I mentioned, we exited it in 2022. Because of the structure of it, we've only begun to see some results. And frankly, those results probably are consistent with our expectations when we shut the program down. So we are continuing to always evaluating the performance of our products, of our capabilities, our businesses, our portfolios, to ensure that we're getting an appropriate return on the business that we do, and so I'm pretty comfortable there.  With respect to our guidance of 35 to 45 basis points, in the period of 2014 to 2019, our average charge-offs were 38 basis points. And so I think we still \u2013 and we have contemplated, we believe, what we consider to be the probability of a soft landing versus a mild recession in our projections for charge-offs. At this point, still feel good about the 35 to 45 basis points in 2024. David Turner : I would add. This is David, that if you think about recessions, probably if it comes, it would be, we think, fairly mild. As we look at consumers and we look at them through the checking account and activity going in there. We look at businesses; we talk to our business partners all the time. Businesses and consumers are in pretty good shape and in particular for the consumer, if you look at housing prices, those continue to remain strong. And a lot of our lending, if you will, in the consumer space is tied to the house, to the home. So I think that we have a bit of a buffer, and going back to the history that John just mentioned, the 38 basis points between \u201814 and \u201819 gives us confidence that even if we did that, we'd be in that range. John Turner : Yeah. Erika Najarian : Thank you. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You noted that high rates are pushing up deposit betas and also changing the mix in NIB, NIB deposits. Some of your peers have been saying we're closer to the end of this. Do you think that there's anything different that you're seeing versus peers or is your deposit strategy changing in any way given the increased likelihood of higher for longer rates? John Turner : I don't think our deposit base, if anything, is a bit better than the peer group. We don't have anything unique to us that would cause our beta to be higher than anybody else in this rising rate environment. As a matter of fact, we did happen to grow more non-interest bearing deposits during the pandemic than most of our peers and that's being put to work. So that element of it, maybe that piece of it is a bit different. And that's what we called for in the guidance that we've given you, that it would remix into interest bearing accounts.  We still have a low loan deposit ratio. We still have, not wholesale funded. So, I don't think that whatever the beta is in the industry, Regions is going to be better than that. We're already better than that right now with a beta of 34% and the peers are at 49% on a peer median basis right now. So I just don't think that if it's coming to the end, then it'll come to the end for us too. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then just a separate question on liquidity. Several of your peers have increased their levels of cash this quarter. How do you think about managing your liquidity ahead of any changes in the LCR rules? David Turner : Yes, so we still have, again, a very liquid balance sheet access to that. We maintain a good cash position right now. We haven't added to our securities book as much as some others. We think to the extent LCR comes in, we'll be able to be compliant with that without any major changes to our structure of our balance sheet. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from a line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please receive your question. John Turner : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hey, John. Hey, David. David, can we circle back to the Shared National Credit exam? I'm curious. Obviously, it's changed over the years, and if I recall correctly, they examined those books both in the spring and the fall, which you referenced. And we'll get the results early in February or sometime in February.  But can you share with us any color, like, what was the emphasis? Was it on leverage loans? Was it on office commercial real estate? Was there greater stress in certain markets over others? Just any elaboration would be helpful. John Turner : Yeah. Gerard, this is John. We didn't notice anything specific about the most recent exam. It was broad-based, both with respect to product type and business and geography. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then you guys touched a little bit about the economy in your markets. You give us, obviously, the forecast you use and building out CECL reserves. What are you guys seeing down there? There's so many cross-currents going on in the national numbers. Still, I'm assuming there's strength. There's employment strength. There's business strength. Any color there would be helpful as well. John Turner : Yes. Across the southeast, which is where 86% of our deposits are in seven southeastern states, we had Texas that goes above 90%. We're still seeing a pretty strong economy, and seven of the eight southeastern states that we would point to, unemployment rates are at or near historical lows. Customers are still \u2013 consumers are still in a very good position. There's plenty of work. There are routinely economic development projects, new jobs being announced across markets; Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi. Of course, Texas is continuing to do really well.  So I'd say customer sentiment is still positive, but cautious given all the things that are going on, both the national and international geopolitical level. But customers are \u2013 businesses are still doing pretty well, and the consumer definitely is. Gerard Cassidy : Actually, John, just to follow-up quickly there, and putting the geopolitical international issues on the side for a moment, do you have any sense what the customers are looking for to give them more confidence? Is it a Fed finishing with interest rates, raising interest rates that we get to that terminal rate or is it better \u2013 the better budgeting out of Washington?  Because we hear this from your peers as well, so it's not uncommon. But we\u2019re \u2013 I'm trying to figure out what the catalyst will be where businesses really get confident again. John Turner : I think the biggest thing is the Federal Reserve and the Fed making a declaration that inflation is now under control and that they are not going to continue to raise rates, don't have to continue to raise rates. I think sending that message and creating a sense that the environment is more stable than others might, business owners may feel today would be hugely helpful.  With respect to what's going on on the national level, politically, I don't know that I have an answer for you there, and I don't expect that to change any time in the near term. Gerard Cassidy : Great. No, I appreciate it. Thank you. John Turner : Okay. That's all the callers for today. I appreciate your participating. Thank you. I'll just say it has been an unusual quarter. Had a number of things going on but at the core our business is really sound and solid. We have spent the last 10 years working to build a balance sheet and income statement that's going to be consistently performing, sustainable and resilient. We believe we've done that. We have a lot of confidence in our future performance and appreciate your support. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation\u2019s Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding our results. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimers and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we reported full year 2023 earnings of $2 billion, reflecting record pre-tax pre-provision income of $3.2 billion and one of the best returns on average tangible common equity in our peer group at 22%. Our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work that\u2019s taken place over the past decade to position the company to generate consistent, sustainable earnings regardless of the economic environment we are experiencing. We have enhanced our credit and interest rate risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. Although the industry continues to face headwinds from lingering economic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the continued evolution of the regulatory framework, we feel confident about our positioning and adaptability heading into 2024. We will continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, solid capital and liquidity and prudent credit risk management. Our proactive hedging strategies continue to position us for success in an array of economic conditions. In our desirable footprint, granular deposit base and relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. Our strategic plan continues to deliver consistent, sustainable long-term performance as we focus on soundness, profitability and growth. In closing, I am excited to work alongside the 20,000 Regions associates who put customers and their needs at the center of all we do and focus on doing the right things the right way everyday. Now, Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let\u2019s start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans decreased modestly on a sequential quarter basis, while ending loans grew a little over 1% compared to the prior year. Within the business portfolio, average and ending loans declined 1% quarter-over-quarter. We are remaining judicious reserving capital for business where we can have a full relationship. Loan demand remains soft as clients continue to exhibit cautious behavior. We are seeing clients make long-term investments when they have to, but if they can defer, they are holding off. In general, sentiment varies across industries with some continuing to expect growth, while others have a more muted outlook. Average and ending consumer loans remained relatively stable as growth in mortgage and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and the GreenSky exit portfolio sale we completed this quarter. Looking forward, we expect 2024 average loan growth to be in the low single-digits. From a deposit standpoint, deposits increased modestly on an average and ending basis primarily due to increases in interest-bearing business products, which we expect will partially reverse with tax season in the first quarter. Across all three businesses, we continue to experience remixing from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. However, the pace of remixing has slowed. Within consumer, we continue to see balanced normalization, but we believe the pace of remixing will continue to slow as short-term market rates appear to have peaked and the relationship of checking balances to spending levels is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall views on deposit balances and rates are unchanged. We expect incremental remixing out of low-cost savings and checking products of between $2 billion and $3 billion and total balances stabilizing by midyear. This results in a non-interest-bearing mix percentage remaining in the low 30% range. So let\u2019s shift to net interest income. Net interest income declined by approximately 4.5% in the quarter driven mostly by deposit cost and mix normalization as well as the start of the active period on $3 billion of incremental hedging. Asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of lower yielding fixed rate loans and securities. Notably, during the quarter, we returned to full reinvestment of pay-downs in the securities portfolio and added $500 million over and above that to the portfolio balance taking advantage of attractive market rate and spread levels. Interest-bearing deposit costs were 2.14% in the quarter, representing a 39% rising rate cycle beta. Growth in higher cost corporate deposits increased our reported deposit betas by approximately 1%, but allowed for the termination of all outstanding FHLB advances. This and a more pronounced slowing in the pace of rate-seeking behavior by retail customers drove modest net interest income outperformance compared to expectations. As we look to 2024, we expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year. $3 billion of additional 4 starting hedges in the first quarter and further late-cycle deposit remixing will be a headwind. However, we expect deposit trends to continue to improve with interest-bearing betas peaking in the mid-40% range. The benefits of fixed rate asset turnover will persist, overcoming the headwinds and driving net interest income growth in the second half of the year. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 net interest income to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. Our guidance assumes for 25 basis point rate cuts with long-term rates remaining stable from year-end. However, the path for net interest income is well insulated from changes in market interest rates. The primary driver of net interest income in 2024 will be deposit performance. The lower end of our expected 2024 net interest income range assumes a 25% beta as rates fall, while the higher end assumes a deposit beta similar to what we have experienced during the rising rate environment. In a falling rate environment, we are prepared to manage deposit costs lower to protect the margin. A relatively small portion of interest-bearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase in the cycle. These market price deposits include index and other high beta corporate deposit types that will reprice immediately with Fed funds. The other primary contributor is CDs with a 7-month average maturity. While these products will lag in a falling rate environment, we are positioned to offset this cost. So, let\u2019s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income increased 2% during the quarter as a sequential decline in capital markets was offset by modest increases in most other categories. Full year adjusted non-interest income declined 5%, primarily due to reductions in capital markets and mortgage income as well as the impact of the company\u2019s overdraft grace feature implemented late in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these declines were new records in 2023 for both treasury management and wealth management revenue. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted non-interest income to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. Let\u2019s move on to non-interest expense. Reported non-interest expense increased 8% compared to the prior quarter, but included two significant adjusted items : $119 million for the FDIC special assessment and $28 million in severance-related costs. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower operational losses. Full year adjusted non-interest expense increased 9.7% or approximately 6%, excluding elevated operational losses experienced primarily in the second and third quarters. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy, and vendor spend. We expect full year 2024 adjusted non-interest expenses to be approximately $4.1 billion. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Reported annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter increased 14 basis points. However, excluding the impact of the GreenSky loan sale, adjusted net charge-offs decreased 1 basis point versus the prior quarter to 39 basis points. Full year adjusted net charge-offs were 37 basis points. Total non-performing loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 82 basis points due primarily to downgrades within industries previously identified as higher risk. Keep in mind, between 2013 and 2019, our average NPL ratio was 107 basis points. We expect to see further normalization towards these levels in 2024. Provision expense was $155 million or $23 million in excess of net charge-offs and includes an $8 million net provision expense related to the consumer loan sale. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 3 basis points to 1.73%. Excluding the loan portfolio sold during the quarter, the allowance for credit loss ratio would have increased 6 basis points. The increase to our allowance was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization as well as higher qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain higher risk portfolios. Our average net charge-offs from 2013 to 2019 were 46 basis points. We\u2019ve seen modest acceleration towards these normalized levels in recent quarters. As a result, we expect our full year 2024 net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points. Turning to capital and liquidity. Given the evolution of the regulatory environment, we expect to maintain our common equity Tier 1 ratio around 10% over the near-term. This level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allow us to continue to increase the dividend commensurate with earnings. We ended the year with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.2%, while executing $252 million in share repurchases and $223 million in common dividends during the quarter. With that, we\u2019ll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Appreciate the comments on the main levers for NII or within NII for your guidance. I was hoping you could discuss a little more about the deposit repricing thoughts that you had. Maybe specifically thoughts about sort of the bifurcation between commercial and consumer deposits? And then just any opportunities you\u2019ve seen with the Fed already having sort of peaked out presumably, any opportunities you\u2019ve had already to maybe take some actions to ease the pressure on costs? David Turner : Sure. Scott, this is David. One important thing to note is that about 30% of our customer base is really the driver of our interest-bearing deposit beta. If you look at that, little over half of that is related to our commercial book. And those deposits are indexed. So to the extent Fed changes rates, those indexed data changes. So you\u2019re talking about rightfully 55%, almost 60% of that will come down as rates come down. The other represents consumer deposits. So these have been CDs and money market accounts there where we\u2019ve seen migration out of non-interest-bearing accounts. The money market piece, both of these have to be competitive. We have to watch what our competitors are doing to some degree. But we have mechanisms to really start working that down. Part of that is making sure we don\u2019t go too long on our CD maturities. So we have been fairly short. I think I mentioned in the prepared comments, our average CD term is 7 months. And so we don\u2019t want to extend that much going forward as a matter of fact we\u2019d like to shorten that. It coincides with what we think is going to happen with the Fed. Now we have four cuts baked in to our guidance to hit the midpoint of our guidance, which is on Page 6 of our presentation. And we think that starts probably at the May meeting. And we know that\u2019s different than what the market participants believe, but we think that, that\u2019s going to \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to be slower versus faster. It\u2019s important to note, we are neutral to short-term rates. And so it\u2019s all about managing our deposit costs. And I think we have a good plan to do so. We have given you really a range. It\u2019s a pretty tight range on NII performance on the Page 6 and we kind of talk about betas. So if our betas kind of follow what we had and as rates have gone up, we are 39 a day. We said we\u2019d probably finish in the mid-40s. If we have that coming back down, then we\u2019ll be at the upper end of our range. If we are only at 25% beta as rates come down, knowing things won\u2019t match perfectly then we\u2019d be at the lower end of the range. So our midpoint is a 35% beta, which we think is very doable, in particular, relative to that half of that \u2013 a little over half of that is related to index deposits on the commercial side. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thanks for that color, David. And then maybe on the lending side, you noted soft client demand, which is very understandable. Just curious how you expect demand to trend as the year unfolds? John Turner : Yes. Scott, this is John. I would \u2013 our current projections are, we believe economic activity picks up towards the second half of the year and we believe we will experience some growth in core middle market banking and small business banking through our Centium platform asset-based lending, which would be typical of this period of time. And on the consumer side, mortgage and EnerBank continue to contribute to growth. Again, any growth we have will be modest, and that will occur likely toward the back half of the year. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Alright. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Just maybe I wanted to follow-up on the fee income guide. Maybe if you can dwell into where do you see growth across fee revenue, particularly what are you assuming in there to capital markets was a weakish fourth quarter. So would that be your outlook on capital market income within fees? And then do you expect to do more purchases for mortgage servicing rights as you did in the quarter? And should that boost mortgage income? Thank you. David Turner : Yes. So you \u2013 it\u2019s David. So your first point on capital markets, we had a pretty tough capital markets finish in the fourth quarter. Been in that is timing. We think some deals, in particular, in the M&A world got pushed into the first quarter. The rate environment has really hampered our real estate corporate banking income line a bit. We think those rebound, both of those rebound, we think M&A has a tendency \u2013 a chance to pick up probably towards the back half of the year actually, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of rate relief if you will. So we have a pretty good feel about our capital markets rebound for 2024. Relative to mortgage servicing rights, as you know, we have good capital position. We look to support our business to grow our loan book. We think loan growth will be muted. So we look to other ways to put the capital to work, mortgage servicing rights has been one of those. We feel good about that asset class because we\u2019re good at it. We have a low-cost servicing group and we\u2019re looking to grow when packages make sense and the economics work to our advantage. There is been a number of those on the market. If we can hit the bid that we have to make sure we get an appropriate risk-adjusted return, we will do that. We suspect there\u2019ll be a couple of opportunities during the year as they usually are. But we have room to grow that without adding a lot of fixed overhead to add people to do the servicing, but we don\u2019t have to add a lot of fixed overhead. John Turner : Yes. I\u2019d just add two things, Ebrahim. One is we continue to grow consumer checking accounts and consumer households that contributes to growth. Secondly, we had the best year we\u2019ve probably ever had in treasury management as we see increases in the number of operating accounts that we\u2019re originating and services we\u2019re providing to customers. And then finally, Wealth Management had maybe the best year it\u2019s had certainly in some time, and we expect wealth management fee revenue to continue to grow in 2024. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s helpful. And just one other one, David. I guess the one flex on deposit pricing is your loan-to-deposit ratio at 77% just give us a sense of is this steady state in somewhere in the mid- to high 70s where you see running the bank going forward? Or if we get cut, you could see this ratio drift into the 80s and that probably provides you some pricing flexibility. Thank you. David Turner : Yes. So we really don\u2019t run the bank trying to solve for our loan deposit ratio. It\u2019s just kind of a result of all of our activities that we have. At 77% were a little bit lower than the peer median by 2, 3 points. It gives us some flexibility to not have to put a lot of pressure on the deposit base. Remember, opening comments where we want to be fair and balanced with regards to our customers, making sure that we were competitive but we don\u2019t have to push. We don\u2019t have to be at the upper end of pricing just to maintain those deposits. We have a good core deposit base and it gives us flexibility to not have to chase with rate. And that\u2019s why our deposit costs have tended to be a bit lower across the board. Ebrahim Poonawala : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. I think you mentioned earlier on in the call that clients are deferring longer-term investments, if they can. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that? Is it just rates and they are waiting for rates to come down? Is part of it the environment and they need more certainty there? So any light on your conversations there would be helpful. John Turner : Yes. I think probably all of the above, clearly, rising interest rates that have had some impact rising costs, cost of goods, cost of labor has had an impact. And then uncertainty related to the economy, geopolitical conditions, the political environment here in the U.S., all have, I think, created some restraint. Borrowers are, I believe, more optimistic today than they were 60 to 90 days ago, and that\u2019s in-line with what appear to be improving economic conditions, but still reluctant to initiate long-term investments currently just based upon the things that I described. Manan Gosalia : So as we think about deposit betas when rates go down, I think you and a number of your peers have suggested that okay, loan growth will accelerate as we get a resolution on some of these matters and as rates go down. But then on the flip side, does that mean that deposit competition picks back up? I\u2019m just trying to assess the level of confidence on the high and low end of that range of that 25% to 45% down beta? David Turner : Well, we still think loan growth for the year is going to be relatively muted. And competition for deposits has always been fairly intense. Which you don\u2019t want to have to do is use rate. You want to have a relationship banking model, which is what we do. We leverage off of the checking account of the consumer and an operating account of a business. And with that comes all of the type of funding. For us, we have no wholesale borrowings to speak of, paid off all of our FHLB advances. So we have the ability to lever up there to cover incremental growth without having to reprice our deposit base. So if there is incremental pressure or competition on deposits, I don\u2019t think it will be all that meaningful for us in particular. Manan Gosalia : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning, Ryan. David Turner : Good morning. Ryan Nash : Good morning, John. Good morning, David. Maybe a question on capital. David, in the slides, you talked about maintaining 10%, your over 8% on an adjusted basis. Maybe just talk about how you think about uses of capital outside of loan growth. I know we had some buyback this quarter. I think in December, we were talking about the potential for securities portfolio restructuring. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about incremental uses of capital from here. David Turner : Yes. So obviously, let me just go through the kind of checkpoints as we think about it. So we want to use our capital to support loan growth. It\u2019s going to be fairly muted. As I mentioned, we want to pay a fair dividend, 35% to 45% of our earnings. So we think that\u2019s covered. We then have excess capital that we look to put to work in growing our business. We\u2019ve looked at more searching rights, as I mentioned just a couple of calls ago. And we will continue to look for businesses that we think can help us grow. We have talked about the securities repositioning. We continue to evaluate that. We have not made any decisions to do that just yet. And outside of that, we don\u2019t want our capital to get too far away from 10%. And the 10% is pegged on the fact that we think we\u2019re close enough with our ability to accrete capital every quarter to adapt to whatever the regulatory environment is going to be. There is a lot of uncertainty with regards to what that\u2019s going to look like, and there is no need for us to continue to ramp up capital to an unnecessary level and hurt our return, we think we\u2019re in an optimal spot to be able to maneuver and so we think the 10% number is the right thing to do \u2013 the right place to be. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe to come at net interest income and net interest margin from a little bit of a different perspective. You gave us guidance for the first quarter and NIM is expected to be around 350 for the full year. Maybe David, you were daring talk about how you see it evolving over the course of the year end. When you look out as we think about the declining rate cycle, where do you foresee the net interest margin settling out over time? I know historically, we\u2019ve talked about a 3.6% to 4% range, maybe just a little bit of color on where you see it settling out over the course of the next couple of years? Thank you. David Turner : Yes. So I think you\u2019re going to see that margin pressure a little bit in the first quarter and slightly in the second quarter. The first quarter has another, call it, $3 billion of received fixed swaps that will become effective that will have some negative carry that hurts us a bit in the first quarter. And then things start to change a bit beginning in the second quarter. So literally, like after the first month. So I think you\u2019ll see a little bit more of a movement in the first quarter and a tiny movement in a second. And then we can start to rebound a bit where we will finish we think for the year in the 3.50% range, I think as things sell down. We had talked about 3.60% to 4%. That 3.60% was predicated on rates really going back down at the very low levels, and that\u2019s the purpose of our whole hedging strategy is because we have lower deposit costs of most everybody. If we\u2019re going to protect our margin, we have to do it synthetically. And so we have about $20 billion in any given year of received fixed swaps and some other derivatives to help us manage the net interest margin in the 3.60% to 4% range. So you\u2019re likely over time to be kind of in the middle of that. And we think that that\u2019s a possibility in time that things have to settle out. We\u2019ve got to get deposit costs back to tie up with where rates are. But we can probably exit the year in the 3.60% range. Ryan Nash : Thanks for all the color, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning. John Pancari : On the operating leverage side, I mean, your guidance implies negative operating leverage unsurprisingly for 2024. But as you look at your trajectory on the revenue front, your assumptions there combined with your expense expectations, how do you view the likelihood of achieving positive operating leverage in 2025. And when do you expect that you could break into a more positive trajectory on a quarterly basis. Thanks. David Turner : John, so I have a tendency to look at it on an annual basis. And you are right we can\u2019t generate positive operating leverage in \u201824, primarily because of our outperformance in the first two quarters of \u201823, where we were having above 4% margin, which is way above most everybody. And so I think that\u2019s been acknowledged in the marketplace. I do think we can get back at \u201825 to generate positive operating leverage, and we will start trending there towards the back half of the year as we see us bottoming out in terms of \u2013 and net interest income and margin in the second quarter, and then we can start to grow from there. We will see what the economy looks like. We will see what loan growth looks like. We think that picks up a bit. And we think the pressure on deposit betas start to go the other way. And as I just mentioned, we can exit with a little stronger margin. So I think positive operating leverage towards the back half is a possibility. John Turner : And definitely for 2025. David Turner : And we\u2019re going to get there for 2025. John Pancari : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, around credit, regarding the NPL increase, I know you\u2019ve flagged the downgrade \u2013 the risk rating downgrades and some of the higher risk sectors. Maybe can you give us a little bit more color whether \u2013 was it concentrated in any one sector? Was there a broader scrub of the loan book that you completed that led you to the multiple of the multiple downgrades? Or is it just episodic and then, I guess, just separately, can you talk about the reserve? I know you built it a bit here. What\u2019s the outlook there as you continue to add from here? Thanks. John Turner : I\u2019d just say, John, with respect to the increase in NPLs, we\u2019ve called out portfolios that have been under some stress for a number of quarters now. What we saw in the quarter was some migration from criticized classified to non-performing, specifically in senior housing, in transportation and warehousing, transportation, specifically and office and then additionally, manufacturing of consumer discretionary items. So that was our expectation. We have one large technology credit that moved in the third quarter. That is episodic, we believe, is something that we can and believe we will manage through. So when you look at the migration, as we pointed out, we are moving back to more traditional sort of historical levels of non-performing loans, which is somewhere between 80 and 100 to 110 basis points. I think maybe David said the average was 102 or 106, 107 from \u201814 and \u201819. And we\u2019ve guided to 40 to 50 basis points of charge-offs, which we think is in-line with our expectations for potential loss in the portfolio over time. So I think we feel we have good insight into the credits that we\u2019re managing as to why, I would say the burden of increasing interest rates, increasing cost, cost of labor, operating costs, all those things have had an impact specifically on the industries that we\u2019ve historically now called out transportation, senior housing, office, consumer discretionary. Now with respect to the allowance, we have a process we follow and go through every quarter. And I think we believe \u2013 we currently believe, obviously, that we\u2019ve provided for potential losses in the portfolio over time, unless we experienced growth in the portfolio or paydowns in the portfolio, some changes in outstandings in the portfolio or in economic conditions. You can assume that our allowance is appropriate and likely won\u2019t change the trajectory of it will not change unless the economy changes. David Turner : And the only other thing, John, on that would be if the risk ratings change, then that up or down. That also impacts your provisioning or release reserves. So I add that point with the two or three that John mentioned. John Pancari : And David, I\u2019m sorry, if I could just add regarding that last point, if the risk rating migration negatively assume \u2013 is it now assumed as part of your outlook, just given where we are in this downturn. David Turner : Yes, that\u2019s right. You look at your reasonable and forecast period and think about where the credits are going if that changes, so to go the other way, that can cause you not to have to provide any more. So we provided what we think we need to have. If things get better, then you don\u2019t need the reserves that you put up and you can release those reserves. If things get worse, then you have to provide more. Generally, loan growth is also a driver of having to add to the provision. If your loans are going the other way, then you don\u2019t need the reserves that you had set up for them so you can have a release related to that. Economic conditions got a little better in the fourth quarter than the third. So that was a positive. But net-net, we are continuing to look at the life of the loan and where that\u2019s going to go and we think we have appropriate reserves for losses that are there. John Pancari : Okay. Great. Makes sense. Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Dave Rochester : Hey. Good morning guys. On the NII guide, I was just wondering how Slide 6 might change if we don\u2019t get those cuts you are factoring in for the year. I know you mentioned you are neutral to those, so maybe this range wouldn\u2019t change much. Just figured that might maybe change some of the deposit flow and beta assumptions in here and maybe some other stuff. David Turner : Yes. So, we tried to put that in. If you look at the lower box, on the lower end of that, we say stable, that was trying to address exactly what your question is. So, to the extent that we are kind of where we are. Dave Rochester : That was all within this range. David Turner : That\u2019s right. But the lower end. Dave Rochester : Yes. Got it. And then for the $12 billion to $14 billion in the fixed rate loan production and securities investment you mentioned per year. I was just curious what the breakdown of that was for securities and loans and what yields you are putting on today and on both the securities investment and new loan production, just on average? I know you have got many different categories and loans you are producing. David Turner : Yes. So, I think in total, the kind of the front book, back book between those two is about 200 basis points, 250 basis points of pickup. If you look at that $12 million to $15 million, about a quarter of that\u2019s related to securities. That going on as front book, back book pieces of, call it, 300 basis points in loans front book, back book are probably in the 150 basis points to 200 basis points range. Dave Rochester : Okay. Great. And then just on capital, given your comments on 10% CET1 targeting that unadjusted, what does that mean for the pace of buybacks here? Is the fourth quarter pace is a good one going forward for the next few quarters maybe? And then as it relates to your adjusted CET1 ratio, which is just over 8% you have got here, how are you thinking about where you want that to be over time as the new regs kick in? David Turner : Well, one, we don\u2019t know what the new rules are going to be. So, we fully loaded it with 8.2 to say \u2013 to show you that, that doesn\u2019t impact our stress capital buffer, our absolute minimum. We are in good shape there. We just need to see where the rules come out. By the time all that happens, AOCI is going to be in a different spot than it is today, assuming rates continue to come down a bit. We saw a pretty big move in all of the peers with AOCI this quarter. From a capital standpoint, we think 10 is the right number \u2013 what was\u2026 Dana Nolan : Buyback pace. David Turner : The buyback pace. So, again, we used the buyback as our last mechanism to help us keep our common equity Tier 1 in that 10% range. And so the pace is your favorite earnings expectation, take out the dividend, use a bit of that with low-single digit loan growth. And then the rest is either going to be buying mortgage servicing rights or things of that nature and then we toggle with share repurchases. So, I don\u2019t want to comment on whether we stay on the pace because they end up getting your earnings guidance. That\u2019s a trick. Dave Rochester : Understood. Alright. Thanks guys. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning Gerard. David Turner : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi John. Hi David. David, can you share with us you guys have given us good detail on credit quality and John, you pointed out that the non-performing loan increase was to the sectors of your portfolio that you have already identified as being weak. Could we look at it another way, and you give us good details on Slides 27 and 28 on the leveraged portfolio in the Shared National Credit portfolio, how are those portfolios holding up credit-wise? And when you think back to where we were a year ago, I remember many of the calls, the word recession was used quite often in those calls. We are not hearing that on this fourth quarter earnings call for most or nearly all the banks. So, have these portfolios held up better than what you would have thought it from a year ago? John Turner : I would say, yes, Gerard. The leverage portfolio is largely relationship-based credit business. Those are banking relationships that we enjoy, we are close to those customers and we have been close to them throughout this period of elevated rates. There was some risk as rates rose, that we had \u2013 that there may be some softness in the portfolio, but I think it\u2019s performed well. The same is true of our Shared National Credit book. And we began to build the capital markets business to help us grow and diversify our revenue and to meet more customer needs. We naturally then began to expand the size of our Shared National Credit book so that we could serve those customers that had need for those products and services. And with that, as you can imagine, comes some tall free risk, single name risk and while I mentioned earlier, we have a technology credit that\u2019s fairly substantial. That\u2019s an NPL. That is an example of Shared National Credit exposure that we have good visibility into. We think has very limited risk of loss, but still as a non-performing loan. But overall, I would say, just based upon the reflection on the performance of that book, it\u2019s been good. We have enjoyed expanding relationships, growing revenue from capital markets and/or deposits, treasury management that we enjoy with those customers. And so I think we have been pleased with the performance of both the leverage book and the Shared National Credit book. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then coming back to loans, and I think David, in your comments, you talked about loan demand remains soft and you are looking for low-single digit growth for average loans in 2024. I know during our careers, the shadow banking industry has continued its competition against the banks, but it seems today, there is more coverage of the private equity side getting into lending maybe greater than what we have seen in years, how are you guys competing against the private credit markets? And at the same time, are any of those private credit lenders, customers of yours that you have to balance that relationship of a customer competing against you. John Turner : We have very modest exposure to private equity who then is \u2013 we are not lending private equity to, in turn, lend into our customer base. So, if we have any exposure, it would be very modest there. Separately, we don\u2019t see private equity as a competitor necessarily within our core middle market customer base. I asked Ronnie Smith the question the other day if he could name a customer that we lost to private credit. And we can\u2019t think of one. Now it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not occurring in some of the markets that we are in. But by and large, given our focus on the core middle market business and investment-grade type Shared National Credit exposure, we are just not \u2013 we are not seeing private credit as a competitor today. On the wholesale side now there are lots of competitors on the consumer side that we are seeing in a variety of different ways, including mortgage and home improvement that we compete with. Gerard Cassidy : Which are non-traditional depositories\u2026? John Turner : Yes. That\u2019s right. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Great. Thank you, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Spahr with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning. Dana Nolan : Let\u2019s go ahead, move to the next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon King with Truist. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning. Brandon King : Hey. Good morning. So, I appreciate the guidance on expenses and expense control there. But I did have a question on just an update on the technology modernization project and kind of what you are baking in for expenses in 2024? And if part of that other expense savings is related to maybe delaying some of that project into further years. David Turner : Yes. Brandon, so we have given you our overall expense guide to be essentially flat after you carve out operational losses from the past year. We continue to make investments in our business, we call it R2, which is our transformation project and cyber and risk management, consumer compliance, a lot of investment in areas of the bank that we are looking to offset elsewhere. R2 project has come along very well. We spent anywhere depending on the year, 9% to 11% of our revenue in terms of technology costs. We don\u2019t expect that to change materially in the short-term. We continue to evaluate how we can better leverage technology. And I think we have a lot of upside potential to leverage that in our business to continue to improve and to continue to take out manual steps, manual processes and have a technology solution too. So, we think our investment in technology is the right thing to do. And we are going to have a modern core deposit platform in the not-too-distant future, which we think will be a competitive advantage for us as well. So, anyway, that\u2019s kind of a spending range, if you will, 9% to 11% for revenue. Brandon King : Okay. And just no delays in the timing of that\u2026? John Turner : Yes. No. Yes. To answer your question specifically, that project is on time and on budget, no delays. Brandon King : Okay. And then just had a follow-up on credit, and particularly in senior housing, just wanted to get more details as far as your exposure there? And what are you thinking as far as ultimate loss content in new constructions [ph] from a credit loss spec. John Turner : Yes. We are seeing improvement in the senior housing space, notwithstanding the fact that we have a couple of credits we are carrying as non-performing. We \u2013 generally, occupancy rates are improving over time. Today, we have got about $63 million in \u2013 I am sorry, $57 million in \u2013 $118 million in non-performing loans and reserves against those credits of about 3.7%. So, I think we have maybe provided information on Slide 20 in your deck. But we are seeing improvement in senior housing as occupancy rates pick up and people become a little more comfortable with communal living again amongst that eighth group. Brandon King : Okay. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. John Turner : How are you? Erika Najarian : Good morning. I have one follow-up question, Dave. I think very notable what you said to Ryan\u2019s line of questioning, the 3.6 exit rate for the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. A lot of investors are now focused on that exit rate. So, I am just wondering if I could ask you sort of what the component pieces is or are rather. So, unless you have changed anything on the \u2013 in terms of adding swaps, it seems like you do have $1.6 billion of notional rolling off in the fourth quarter. So, I guess it\u2019s a good guy. You also mentioned a terminated block gain in your 10-Q, but you had like a forward look for four quarters. Wondering what that could be for 4Q \u201824 and then more notably, obviously, you guys have said unequivocally that it\u2019s the deposit assumption that\u2019s really going to make a difference. I am wondering sort of what the speed is that you are assuming on that 35% down beta, especially if you think of the first rate cut, I think you said was in May. David Turner : Yes. So, I think all-in, the big drivers there are controlling the deposit costs. We do have a headwind of the $3 billion notional four starting swap in the first quarter and then we are kind of in the run rate that the terminated swaps are in the amortization already. Those aren\u2019t the huge drivers. I think after we get our headwind and if rates start to come down, then like I said, almost 60% of our beta is associated with index deposits on the commercial side, so they will start to come down. And you start then having the loan and security re-pricing, the fixed maturity re-pricing, adding 200 basis points, 250 basis points that overwhelms that headwind towards the back end of the year and you get a little bit of loan growth in the back end. All that helps you propel you to a much stronger fourth quarter finish than you have at the beginning of the year. So, I think if you really looked at what is the one big thing that you have to get done and its controlling the deposit cost, and we do that through managing the beta as rates change, like I said, 55%, 60% of an index. The other is decisioning we have to make. And that gets to be a little herky-jerky because, as I have mentioned, some of that\u2019s money market that we can change pretty quickly. The other CDs that were locked in today, it\u2019s seven months. And as things renew this month, next month and going forward, we are looking to be shorter rather than longer so that we are prepared to take advantage to reduce our deposit costs as rates come down. Erika Najarian : And a follow-up to that, you mentioned 55% to 60% of that down rate coming from these indexed commercial deposits. One of your peers made a differentiation between indexed and contractual yesterday. And I guess just give us some sense of how much of that is contracted versus index? And but really, it sounds like you are confident that either way, you can control that to the downside, especially as you said, loan growth remained soft this year. David Turner : Yes. So, when we say index, we are talking about it\u2019s tied to Fed funds is when Fed funds changes through the contract, it changes automatically. There is no \u2013 it\u2019s not a contractual number locked in like effectively a CD. It\u2019s the day \u2013 just like a loan that\u2019s based on SOFR, I mean, SOFR changes, so there is a loan rate that day. And so that\u2019s what we are talking about when we say index deposits. Erika Najarian : Okay. Got it. Thank you. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Any updated thoughts on potential regulatory changes to the debit card interchange fees or overdraft fees and thinking about potential all cost to that. David Turner : Well, so debit interchange going through a discussion to adjust that down. This was written in the original law and they had to revisit the costs associated with debit interchange. To the extent that does get put into place, that will have a negative impact to us. Starting, I think that was going to be kicking in, in June. So, it\u2019s about half a year. And based on our numbers, that\u2019s about a $45 million risk item to us in our NIR. Relative to the overdrafts, we are a long way from knowing where that comes out, if there are any changes, and I think 2025 date that we mentioned, that just hit the wire. I think there is going to be a lot of discussion on that because we are disappointed in that. We think provision of liquidity to our customer base is really, really important. We do charge a fee for that, but we are paying an item for somebody in charging a fee. And to the extent we return that item to wherever was written or used, that entity is going to charge a fee. And so it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not helpful to not be able to provide liquidity to our customer base. And so we are hoping there is going to be further discussion on that point. And I think it would be premature to really talk about the impact of OD until we get further down the road. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yes. Okay. And then just separately, good to see the elevated check fraud came down as you expected and the outlook kind of implies, but you are confident that you are past this issue. I guess just wanted to reconfirm that. And then also just any meaningful changes that you made to address it and whether they have showed up and expenses were well. John Turner : I would just say that the countermeasures that we put in place which include talent, technology, process changes, all have been effective. And we believe going forward, the run rate will be $20 million to $25 million a quarter in operating losses, and the expenses associated with those countermeasures are embedded in our run rate and in our projection for expenses for 2024. David Turner : We got to continue to be vigilant with regards to this, just like we are with cyber. So, we have bad people attacking us as does every financial institution, and we have to continue to stay ahead of it. We feel good about what we put in place, but we are not sitting idle, we are continuing to push and challenge ourselves to get even better than we are today. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. John Turner : Thank you. Okay. Operator, is that the end of the calls? Operator : Yes. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. John Turner : Okay. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate everybody\u2019s participation today and interest in our company. Have a good weekend. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's quarterly earnings call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding our results. The earning documents include a forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $343 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.37. However, adjusted items reconciled within our earnings supplement and press release, representing an approximate $0.07 negative impact on our reported results. For the first quarter, total revenue was $1.7 billion on a reported basis and $1.8 billion on an adjusted basis as both net interest income and fee revenue demonstrated resiliency in the face of lingering macroeconomic and political uncertainty. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased quarter-over-quarter and is expected to represent the high watermark for the year as seasonal impacts offset our ongoing expense management actions. Average loans were lower quarter-over-quarter, reflecting limited client demand, client selectivity, paydowns and an increase in debt capital markets activities. Average and ending deposits continued to grow during the quarter, consistent with seasonal patterns. Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations. While pressure remains within pockets of business lending, our consumers remain strong and healthy. We anticipate overall asset quality will perform consistent with historical levels experienced prior to the pandemic. In closing, we feel good about the successful execution of our strategic plan as evidenced by our solid top line revenue, which allows us to continue delivering consistent, sustainable long-term performance while focused on soundness, profitability and growth. Now David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans decreased modestly on a sequential quarter basis. Within the business portfolio, average loans declined 1% as modest increases associated with funding previously approved in investor real estate construction loans were offset by declines in C&I lending. Approximately $870 million of C&I loans were refinanced off of balance sheet through the debt capital markets during the quarter. Average consumer loans remained relatively stable as growth in residential mortgage, EnerBank and consumer credit card were offset by declines in home equity and run-off portfolios. We expect 2024 average loans to be stable to down modestly compared to 2023. From a deposit standpoint, deposits increased on average and ending basis, which is typical for the first quarter tax refund season. In the second quarter, we expect to see declines in overall balances, reflecting the impact of tax payments. The mix of deposits continue to shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing products, though the pace of remixing has continued to slow. Our analysis of the trends and overall customer spending behavior gives us confidence that by midyear, we'll have a noninterest-bearing mix in the low 30% area which corresponds to approximately $1 billion to $2 billion of potential further decline in low interest savings and checking balances. So let's shift to net interest income. As expected, net interest income declined by approximately 4% linked quarter, and the net interest margin declined 5 basis points. Deposit, remixing and cost increases continue to pressure net interest income. The full rising rate cycle interest-bearing deposit beta is now 43%, and we continue to expect to peak in the mid-40% range. Offsetting this pressure, asset yields continue to benefit from higher rates through the maturity and replacement of lower-yielding fixed-rate loans and securities. We expect net interest income to reach a bottom in the second quarter followed by growth over the second half of the year as deposit trends continue to improve and the benefits of fixed rate asset turnover persist. The narrow 2024 net interest income range between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion portrays a well-protected profile under a wide array of possible economic outcomes. Performance in the range will be driven mostly by our ability to reprice deposits. A relatively small portion of interest-bearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase this cycle, mostly index deposits and CDs. We have taken steps to increase flexibility such as shortening promotional CD maturities and reducing promotional rates. If the Fed remains on hold, net interest income likely falls in the lower half of the range, assuming modest incremental funding cost pressure. So let's take a look at fee revenue, which experienced strong performance this quarter. Adjusted noninterest income increased 6% during the quarter as most categories experienced growth, particularly capital markets. Improvement in capital markets was driven by increased real estate, debt capital markets and M&A activity. A portion of both real estate and M&A activities were pushed into the first quarter from year-end as clients delayed transactions. Late in the first quarter, we also closed on the bulk purchase of the rights to service $8 billion of residential mortgage loans. We have a low-cost servicing model. So you'll see us continue to look for additional opportunities. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest income to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 6% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by seasonal HR-related expenses and production-based incentive payments. Operational losses also ticked up during the quarter. The increase is attributable to check-related warranty claims from deposits that occurred last year. Despite this increase, current activity has normalized to expected levels, and we continue to expect full year 2024 operational losses to be approximately $100 million. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest expenses to be approximately $4.1 billion with first quarter representing the high watermark for the year. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Adjusted net charge-offs increased 11 basis points driven primarily by a large legacy restaurant credit and one commercial manufacturing credit. As a reminder, we exited our fast casual restaurant vertical in 2019 and the remaining portfolio is relatively small. Total nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter and continue to normalize towards historical averages, while total delinquencies improved 11%. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 94 basis points due primarily to downgrades within industries previously identified as under stress. We expect NPLs to continue to normalize towards historical averages. Provision expense was $152 million or $31 million in excess of net charge-offs, resulting in a 6 basis point increase in the allowance for credit loss ratio to 1.79%. The increase to our allowance was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization, and incrementally higher qualitative adjustments for risk in certain portfolios previously identified as under stress. We continue to expect our full year 2024 net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points. Let's turn to capital and liquidity. We expect to maintain our common equity Tier 1 ratio consistent with current levels over the near term. This level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet proposed changes along with the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend commensurate with earnings. We ended the quarter with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, while executing $102 million in share repurchases and $220 million in common dividends during the quarter. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : David, just following up on your comments around noninterest-bearing deposits sitting mid -- I guess, low 30% by mid-2024. Just give us a sense of if we don't get any rate cuts, do you see that dipping below 30% based on what you're seeing in terms of customer behavior and just use of balances as I'm assuming there's some attrition on consumer balances that's at play here? So like where do you see that mix bottoming out? And what's the latest that you are seeing in terms of pricing competition across the markets? David Turner : Yes. So from a balance standpoint, we still feel pretty confident based on flows that we have seen and expect that we'd be in that low 30% range. We continue to look to grow noninterest-bearing balances through new checking accounts, new operating accounts. That's what's important to us. That's what fuels our profitability. And so being in the favorable places, in particular, in the Southeast where there's migration of businesses, people give us some comfort that we can grow there. We talked about deposits bottoming out this first half of the year and then maybe growing a little bit from there. So I think that low 30% range is a good -- still a good level. With regards to competition on pricing, I think at the end of the day, we haven't seen, across the industry, a lot of loan growth. And as a result of that, competition for deposits is not as strong as it could have been had we had a lot of loan demand. We always have competition. We have to be fair and balanced with our customers and making sure that we are creating value. And so we look at what our competitors are doing from a price standpoint, and we adjust accordingly. But there's nothing unusual that's happening there. And I think the biggest driver of that is because of the lack of loan growth. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just a separate question. As we think about capital deployment that you outlined on Slide 10, is there more to go in terms of just the appetite for securities repositioning? And how much should we expect in terms of what you did in 1Q with regards to the lift in the second quarter to bond yields? David Turner : Yes. So we consistently challenge ourselves on what's the best use of our capital that we generate. Obviously, we're at a robust 10.3% common equity Tier 1. We think we're close enough to be in striking distance on whatever the regime changes with regards to capital. And again, with loan growth being muted in the industry, we want to pay a fair dividend. So we're generating capital that needs to be put to work. We either buy the shares back or we do things like securities repositioning. We did the $50 million in the first quarter. We'll continue to look for opportunities. I would say that proof is not as close to the ground as it was because we want to keep our payback less than 3 years and frankly closer to 2.5 if we can get it. Our payback in this last trade was about 2.1. And so we think that was a great use of capital for us. And so we'll look to do that, but we're not committing to it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Robert Siefers : I was hoping you could please flesh out some of the rationale behind the softened loan growth outlook. I certainly understand it, given the backdrop and what we're seeing in the H8 data. But it in ways contrast with some peers who might be expecting more of an acceleration in the second half. So just curious to hear your updated thoughts on customer demand and how they're thinking. David Turner : Well, on the consumer side, as we mentioned, we did a pretty good job growing mortgage, growing EnerBank, growing card, but it was offset by declines in the home equity which made consumers flat. Consumers are actually in really good shape. Now we feel good about that, we just don't see a lot of loan growth -- net-net loan growth. Relative to commercial, depending on the industry, some industries are blowing and going, and others are being careful at this point. We've had nice production, but we've had payoffs and pay downs. And of course, this past quarter, we had $870 million of debt placements through our M&A group that helped us from an NIR standpoint, but obviously hurt us from a balance standpoint. If we start seeing rates actually decline, that activity will pick up. And so net-net, it's going to be hard to grow meaningfully through all of that activity. And we're fine with that. We don't need to push. In this environment, there's still uncertainty. We don't need to push for loan growth. We need to be careful on client selectivity. John has talked about that numerous times. And we want to be careful. We clearly have the capital and liquidity to do so. And if we see opportunities, we'll grow, but we're not going to force it. Robert Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And then separately, I was hoping you could discuss the additional operational losses. it was definitely glad to see no change to the full year expectation, though they were elevated in the first quarter. Maybe just an additional color. Were there new instances of the issues that have cropped up last year? Or were these just sort of true-ups? And what gives you confidence that all the issues are still resolved and everything? John Turner : Yes. This is John. So there were no new events. The tail was, with respect to the breach of warranty claims, was a little longer than we anticipated. And as a result, we did incur some additional losses in the quarter. What gives us confidence that we can meet our expectations is the exit rate for the quarter was significantly reduced, which implies that the countermeasures we put in place, the talent that we've recruited for our fraud prevention activities, all of that is working and gives us confidence that we can and in fact, meet our $100 million target for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So one question just on how we're thinking about NII for the full year in relation to loan growth being a little slower. So I just wanted to understand, your NII guide obviously, is the same as it was before. Loan growth expectations, a little slower understandably so. How do I square those things? David Turner : Well, loan growth, we had talked about being in the back half of the year. So you weren't going to get a lot of carry from loan growth in our guidance. And so really what we want to see loan growth for the back half of the year is setting us up for 2025, not for 2024. So that was never factored into the guidance that we gave you on NII. We feel good about where we're positioned from a balance sheet standpoint with basically neutral to short-term rates. And we have a little bit of shape to the curve where we reinvest our securities book and we're picking up a little over 200 basis points -- 235 basis points on that, front book, back book. So that gives us confidence there that we're going to do pretty well with regards to the NII. And if you look at the input cost, so our deposit cost, they've also started to flatten. If we look at the months of February and March, there was little change in our deposit costs. So our cumulative beta, which is at 43 today, we said would be in the mid-40s. We have a lot of confidence in that. So that's why we didn't change our NII guide. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then just on the securities repositioning that you talked about on Slide 5, is it? Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the go forward here. You added some duration, again, makes sense, but wanted to know if you're thinking of leaning in even more? Like how long will -- are you comfortable extending the duration of the securities book is basically the question. David Turner : Well, our extension duration was only like .12, 12 basis points a year. So negligible. And from our standpoint, especially if you believe the risk of rates going up is very low, i.e., you believe they're either flat to down, then perhaps taking a little duration risk where we can get compensated for make some sense today. Our duration naturally is declining. So doing a trade to kind of keep it flat to modestly higher than where we are right now, it seems to make sense. And it's a good use of capital. If we can get a payback, like I said, the one we just did, our payback's 2.1 years. We'd like it to be less than 3, closer to 2.5 if we can. And so while we won't commit to doing that, we would look at it. And if we did it, it would be no more than what you just experienced. We want to keep it at a fairly small percentage of our pretax income. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the credit front, saw about a moderate increase in nonperformers in the quarter. However, your loan loss reserve is pretty stable despite the move-in reserves. So -- I mean, not performance, so I just want to see if you get a little bit of color on how you're thinking about the reserves here? And also, maybe if you can give a little bit more color behind the nonperformers. John Turner : Yes. John, maybe I'll start. This is John Turner. First of all, we began signaling now a couple of quarters ago, stress in a couple of specific portfolios or industries : office, senior housing, transportation, health care, specifically goods and services, and technology. And the increases that we are seeing in nonaccrual loans and classified loans are largely consistent with the indication that there is stress in those particular industries. In fact, when you look at our nonaccruals, 21% of our -- 21 of our nonaccruals -- excuse me, 21 credits make up 72% of our nonaccruals, and 18 of those 21 credits are in those 5 sectors that I mentioned. So we did anticipate that we would see some deterioration, and that's been consistent with our expectations. The second thing I'd point to is several quarters ago, we began to set the expectation that we would return to pre-pandemic historical levels of credit metrics. And specifically, that would be an average charge-off ratio of about 46 basis points, and nonaccruals of 105 basis points. And again, we are -- we have trended back to those ranges, which is consistent with our expectations. With regard to the allowance, we go through the process every quarter to ensure that we're properly reserved against expectation for loss in those portfolios. Given that we have a very high degree of visibility into the 21 credits that make up 72% of our nonaccruals, you can expect that we feel very good about our reserve position. John Pancari : Okay. Great. And then separately, on the expense front, I know you mentioned that the first quarter should represent the high watermark on expenses. Is that primarily because of the elevated operating losses? Or do you expect some building efficiencies through the remainder the year, either given the backdrop or given the revenue picture? David Turner : John, several things. And we have probably $75 million worth of expense we can point to on different front. So part of it is operational losses that we don't think will repeat. We obviously have the first quarter issues with regards to payroll taxes and things of that nature. We had HR asset valuation that's offset in NIR that's a part of that, too. We have some things in occupancy and professional fees. If you add all that up, it's about $75 million, and we have pretty good confidence that, that won't repeat. We tried to signal that the first quarter was going to be the high watermark and that you couldn't take the $4.1 billion and divide by 4, and we're sticking to that, and we're sticking to our guidance that we have. And we have pretty good confidence. We did take some actions this quarter like we did in the fourth quarter from a severance standpoint. Now the first quarter has the normal expense of payroll for those folks in addition to the severance. So that won't repeat. So all of that, like I said, adds up to right around $75 million. John Turner : And that's just -- we have other opportunities to reduce expenses as well. That's just an indicator of what we can pretty quickly identify it won't repeat. John Pancari : And if I could ask just one follow-up related to that. Is your -- the status of your core systems conversion. Is that still trending as expected in terms of timing and cost? John Turner : It is. Yes. We, in fact, just had a Board meeting this week and went through all that detail with our Board. We feel good about the project and the progress that we're making and our ability to stay on budget on time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Wondering if we -- David, you could talk a little bit about that bullet you put in on Slide 5 about stable deposit costs, February to March. And what our takeaway should be in terms of mix shift pricing movement, et cetera, and I know you talked about still mid-40s deposit betas, but just what's changing underneath in terms of that stability that you're starting to see? David Turner : Yes. Part of -- one of the big reasons we put that in there is because our deposit cost change was higher than what you're seeing from peers, but that's because of what we did in the fourth quarter, and you had a full quarter effect of that. Now that we've kind of got that baked into the base, and we start seeing offers and things of that nature on the deposit offerings coming down, the exit in February and March gives us a lot of confidence that those deposit costs are stabilizing and therefore, we have a lot of confidence in our cumulative beta band in the mid-40s. So a couple of more points from where we are today. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, are you starting to change pricing, change offers, bring in duration? What are you doing in terms of trying to take that point further? David Turner : Yes, that's a good point, Kenneth. So yes, we started that last quarter. Actually, we had some CD maturities coming that were longer dated 12-, 13-month CDs and we went shorter in the 5- to 7-month range that to be able to reprice those this year with the original expectation the rates would be coming down sooner than they probably are now. And so -- yes. And we can see from a competitive standpoint, we want to be competitive, we don't have to lead with price, but we do need to be fair and balanced. And so you're starting to see the benefit of having the promotional rates coming down here. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And on that last point about the higher for longer, you've talked about the $12 billion to $14 billion of fixed rate production for a while now and you say that's per year. Has the benefit from that also -- does that get better and higher for longer? And how does that differ when you think about this year versus next year? David Turner : Yes, I would say marginally higher for longer because you have a lot of securities that are repricing, that we're picking up about 235 basis points today. We're picking up, call it, 125 basis points on the loan side. So if you get -- and we expect to get the deposit costs stabilized then you don't -- then the repricing can actually start overwhelming the costs that you had on the deposit side. That has not been the case thus far. It's been just the opposite. So you're going to see that turn, which is why we're calling the bottom for us in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. David Rochester : Just on credit regarding the large restaurant credit and the commercial manufacturing credit, could you guys quantify the impacts on net charge-offs and provision this quarter? And if you could just give some additional background on where you are in the resolution process there, that'd be great. David Turner : So if you were to look at those two added together, just those two made about 7 basis points of charge-offs. So if we didn't have those two, our 50 would have been 43. David Rochester : Great. And then where are you guys in the process of resolving those? David Turner : Say that again? David Rochester : Where are you in the process of resolving those credits? John Turner : They're both still being worked out. David Rochester : Okay. And I guess just bigger picture with you reiterating the net charge-off guide here for the year of 40 to 50 bps, you're at the high end of that right now. So you're expecting that to either remain stable here or decline through the end of the year, and you have confidence around that? John Turner : Yes, we do. David Rochester : Great. And then just switching to deposits with the recent inflation data that's been elevated and the shift to expectations to fewer rate cuts this year, are you noticing any impact from any of that on your corporate deposit customers' behavior at all? Are you seeing any change in activity there? And does that impact your expected range of NIB remix at all for the year? David Turner : No. Our NIB largely comes from our consumer base. We do obviously have a big NIB on the commercial side. I think folks that were going to move out of NIB to seek rate have done so. And we think that that's why we're calling for our NIB to decline a little bit but still stay in the low 30% range. And they all just want to maintain a little bit more liquidity going into a cycle that still has uncertainty, geopolitical risk, our own elections this year. But no, I don't think from an inflation standpoint, we're going to see a huge change from NIB. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: Was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the fee trends the deposit service charges were up nicely. And I know the treasury management is a big part and a positive driver, but there is weaker seasonality. So I was wondering if you can scale that out. John Turner : Yes. So if you look at -- just talk about fee revenue across different parts of the business. Treasury management is up 7% year-over-year, and that's a reflection both of increases in fees and increases in relationships and activities. So the nice growth in that business. Similarly, wealth management is up over 6% year-over-year, which is both reflective of increases in asset valuations and increases in assets held for customers increasing relationships. We also saw a really nice increase in mortgage activity during the quarter, and we would expect that to continue. Consumer fees are down modestly, and that's a reflection really of the implementation of all the changes we've made to benefit customers with respect to overdrafts. And more specifically, as a result of the implementation of overdraft grades, we've seen about a 25% reduction in the number of customers who are actually overdrawn. So that is resulting in some decline in fee revenue, offset by our -- currently by interchange activity and customers use of their debit cards. So generally, fee income is solid. We're seeing good growth in the wholesale parts of our business and in wealth management that reflect growth in relationships and growth in activities. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then capital markets, that also came in strong, and I think you've had this like $60 million to $80 million range in the past with wind for upside. And yes, just talk to, were there any deals that -- just talk to how sustainable you think that is? Obviously, it's somewhat market dependent, but a little more color on the 1Q driver there and the thoughts going forward. John Turner : Yes. I think we still stick to that range generally and incorporate our expectations for capital markets into the broader guidance of around $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in adjusted NIR. But we do see good pipelines. Capital markets activity is picking up. There's more M&A activity. We're seeing more customers go to the institutional market to raise debt, which has been helpful. Our M&A activity was pretty diverse during the quarter. And then real estate capital markets, which is a really important business for us is also very active. And so we feel pretty good about the $60 million to $80 million range for the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. David Turner : Gerard, before you ask your question, let me clean something up from a question that just came up in terms of the, what's the charge-off percentage would have been had we not had those two large credits. I said 7 basis points. It's 13 basis points actually. So we would have been at 37 had we not had those two. I didn't do the math correctly. I just want to make sure that gets fixed in the transcript. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. All set? John Turner : Gerard, fire away. Gerard Cassidy : Can you give us an update where the proposal is going for the long-term debt? And when do you think that will be finalized in the NPR that's out there? And second, as part of that, what your latest estimate is? I know you've given us some color on this in the past, but what's your latest estimate and what it might cost you once you have to -- and your peers, of course, have to issue the debt and carry higher levels of debt? David Turner : Yes. So Gerard, the whole Basel III and long-term debt has kind of gone into a little bit of a hold at the time. We're not sure when that will get taken care of. We suspect it will be this year at some point. The proposal on debt was to have 6% of RWA, which is about $7 billion for us. To give you credit for what you have outstanding, which is a couple of billion. So you're talking about raising $5 billion. We can leverage that and put it to work. And it wasn't a terrible drag on NII, less than 1% drag on NII for us. It's fully implemented and this was going to take time to do that. We need to have some -- our $2 billion of existing long-term debt is -- it's something we were going to address just in a natural order of things. But with loan growth being muted, there's no need to go out and raise debt if you don't have to have it. We're hoping that the proposal cuts down from the 6% number. There's been talk of it maybe being in the 2% to 3% range of RWA, but we don't know. We'll just have to adapt and overcome when the new rule gets put out. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the identification of the stress portfolios with credit. In your prepared comments, David, you mentioned that some of the increase in the nonperformers was due to -- I think you said, yes, some of it was due to the downgrades in certain -- in those industries that you have identified. Can you share with us what -- within those downgrades, what process -- or not the process, but what caused the downgrades? Was it debt service coverage? Was it the business, the borrowers' business is deteriorating for some reason? Can you give a little more color on the downgrade part of that? David Turner : Gerard, usually, we're seeing strength in consumers and businesses in general. There are pockets of stressed industries that John mentioned earlier. I think at the end of the day, they seem to be more idiosyncratic to the business model of that borrower, and these are valuation charges that are being taken. And so you don't have any one -- when you kind of cut to the chase, you think about credit risk actually being fairly good right now, but you're going to have these pockets -- these one-off pockets, as I just mentioned, just two credits for us. It's a big deal in terms of the effect on the charge-off percentage. So -- and we don't see it as a contagion as much as we see it as an idiosyncratic business issue. Gerard Cassidy : I see. So it wasn't really like across the board, the higher rate environment for these downgrades really affected it, but it was more idiosyncratic for each one of the borrowers. John Turner : I think the one exception to that, Gerard, would be transportation where we are seeing that industry, particularly the truckload industry and smaller borrowers is under some stress and valuations -- equipment valuations are also under stress. I mean, obviously, if you think about real estate-related portfolios, office and senior housing, in particular, you can understand why those are also under stress, but transportation would be the one area where I would say it feels like across that industry for the truckload related. The less in truckload businesses are still doing okay, but truckload-related carriers are having challenges. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Spahr with Wells Fargo. Christopher Spahr : So my question is just relating to the shift in loan mix over the last few years, particularly with EnerBank and comparing it to the average pre-pandemic charge-offs. And kind of your thoughts on where you think the mix would have -- has shifted a little bit and might have impacted the comparisons. And then just thoughts about the EnerBank kind of portfolio itself, it seems to be holding up a little bit better than expected. David Turner : Well, let me couch it in terms of just our overall portfolio from a CECL standpoint. So if you go back to pre-pandemic, so the fourth quarter 2019, when we all implemented CECL, our CECL reserve at that time was 1.71%. If you adjust that for the portfolio we have today, so there's pluses and minuses, just a completely different mix, and apply those same loss rates to our current portfolio, that would imply a seasonal reserve of 162. I think that's on one of our slides. And so I think at the end of the day, we have pretty robust reserves to cover expected losses. The stress portfolios that we've talked about are our driver. The lower FICO bands of consumer have more pressure on it than the rest of the consumer base. And some of the portfolios that we've added, whether it be EnerBank or Ascentium, those are higher-yield portfolios, and they have higher loss content. In both cases, we had those two portfolios, EnerBank and Ascentium at, call it, 2%, 2.5% expectation, and they're performing in line with that. So -- and I think it gets back to the fact that businesses and consumers, generally speaking, are in pretty good shape. So we've been real careful making sure we don't grow too fast in those portfolios. And so far, everything is worth according to plan. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Peter Winter : Just one quick question. Last quarter, you mentioned an exit rate for the NIM around 360. I'm just wondering if you're still comfortable with that? Just on the one hand, you're building more liquidity, but then you did the securities restructuring. David Turner : Yes. I think whether we get -- we should get pretty close to that number still. Again, we're not counting on rates being a huge driver. Incrementally, though, if we have the long end that stays higher than our reinvestment yields are a little bit better. And if short rates come down, then our negative carry on, our swap book will be helped and that could propel us. So I would say the upper 350s to 360, we are carrying a bit more cash. You probably saw that, just out an abundance of caution given the events of last quarter. And while that cash doesn't really hurt us from an NII standpoint, it does hurt us from a margin standpoint. And so we still should have one of the leading margins regardless because we have a lot of confidence in our funding costs kind of settling down. Peter Winter : Got it. And how much benefit do you get from the securities restructuring on the margin? David Turner : Well, cost is, round number, $50 million, and it's a payback of 2.1 years. So you can do quick math. You mean on margins? It's a couple of basis points of positive. Operator : Mr. Turner, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. John Turner : Okay. Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your interest in our company. That concludes the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions' Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high level commentary regarding our results. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we reported strong second quarter earnings of $477 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.52. For the second quarter, total revenue remained relatively stable at $1.7 billion on a reported basis and $1.8 billion on an adjusted basis as net interest income remained resilient and fee revenue declined modestly compared to the first quarter. As expected, adjusted non-interest expenses declined quarter-over-quarter and are expected to remain at this approximate level for the remainder of the year. Average and ending loans remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest customer demand, continued focus on client selectivity and paydowns in the portfolio. Average deposits also remained relatively stable while ending deposits declined modestly during the quarter, consistent with seasonal tax related patterns. We experienced broad based improvement in overall asset quality this quarter. Non-performing and business services criticized loans as well as net charge-offs improved sequentially. In summary, we're proud of our second-quarter results, driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. We have a great plan and the investments we're making in talent, technology and in products and services are positioning us to benefit as macroeconomic conditions improve. Our footprint continues to provide us with significant opportunities. And while we are experiencing more competition in our markets, our long-standing presence, commitment to communities and the favorable brand we've built over many years positions us well. As long as we remain focused on execution, I have no doubt that we can continue generating top quartile results. Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans remained relatively stable on a sequential quarter basis. Within the business portfolio, while average loans remained relatively stable, ending loans increased 1%. Despite near term macroeconomic and political uncertainty, pipelines are beginning to rebuild. Average consumer loans also remained stable as modest growth in residential mortgage and consumer credit card were offset by declines in home equity and other miscellaneous consumer loans. We continue to expect 2024 average loans to be stable to down modestly compared to 2023. From a deposit standpoint, deposits remained relatively stable on an average basis while ending balances declined 2%. These declines in the second quarter reflect anticipated tax seasonality. Having largely returned to pre-pandemic patterns, we expect relative stability in deposits, which is typical for summer and early fall. As expected, deposit remixing has slowed. Competitive pricing and customer demand for promotional products has stabilized. Over the second quarter, the proportion of non-interest bearing deposits relative to total deposits has remained steady in the low 30% range. Now, let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income increased modestly during the quarter, outperforming our expectations. The increase reflects stabilizing deposit trends and asset yield expansion. Also exceeding expectations, the net interest margin declined only 4 basis points, resulting primarily from higher average cash levels. As expected, deposit remixing and cost increases slowed meaningfully in the quarter. The full cycle interest bearing deposit beta remained stable at 43%, and we continue to expect a mid-40% deposit beta will be the peak this cycle. Asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of fixed rate loans and securities at current higher rate levels. This includes the repositioning of approximately $1 billion of securities late in the quarter with an estimated payback period of 2.6 years relative to the $50 million pre-tax loss recorded this quarter. Following our successful $750 million debt issuance in June, we used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of securities with a similar duration in order to maintain a relatively neutral balance sheet position and bolster liquidity. We believe net interest income has reached an inflection point and is expected to grow over the second half of the year as deposit trends continue to improve and the benefits of fixed rate asset turnover persist. As we move further into 2024, a stabilizing deposit and funding environment, along with securities repositioning and favorable debt issuance levels have pushed our expectation for net interest income towards the upper end of our $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion range. This narrow range portrays a well protected profile under a wide array of possible economic outcomes. Now, let's take a look at fee revenue performance this quarter. Adjusted non-interest income declined 3%, driven primarily by lower capital markets and mortgage income. If you recall, capital markets experienced seasonally elevated activity in the first quarter as several bills were pushed from the fourth quarter of 2023. Over time and in a more favorable interest rate environment, we expect our capital markets business can consistently generate quarterly revenue of approximately $100 million. But in the near term, we expect it will run around $70 million to $80 million per quarter. The decline in mortgage income was primarily driven by a positive $6 million adjustment to the company's mortgage pipeline valuation in the first quarter that did not repeat. While modestly lower versus the seasonally high first quarter, Treasury Management continues to perform exceptionally well. Versus the second quarter of last year, Treasury Management's client base has increased 6% while total revenue is up 8%. Helping to offset this quarter's fee income declines, wealth management increased 3% to a new quarterly record, reflecting increased sales activity and stronger markets. Based on a strong first half of the year, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted non-interest income to be at the top end of our $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion range. Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 6% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower salaries and benefits, occupancy and professional fees. The improvement in salaries and benefits was attributable primarily to lower base salaries and seasonally higher HR related expenses in the first quarter. Operational losses also decreased during the quarter and current activity continues to normalize within expected levels. We continue to expect full year 2024 operational losses to be approximately $100 million. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. Based on results through the first half of the year, including outperformance in revenue and our expectation to be towards the top end of our previously provided full year revenue ranges, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted non-interest expenses to be between $4.15 billion and $4.2 billion. Regarding asset quality, as John indicated, overall credit performance improved during the quarter. Provision expense was essentially equal to net charge-offs at $102 million and the resulting allowance for credit loss ratio remained relatively stable at 1.78%. We expect full year 2024 net charge-offs to be towards upper end of our 40 to 50 basis point range attributable to a few large credits within our higher risk portfolios. However, those losses are fully reserved for. Assuming stable loan balances and a relatively stable economic outlook, we expect our ACL ratio to remain flat to declining over the second half of the year. Let's turn to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4%, while executing $87 million in share repurchases and $220 million in common dividends during the quarter. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.25 per share, a 4% increase over the second quarter. This increase is in addition to the 20% increase last year, representing three consecutive years of robust dividend growth, well supported by underlying financial performance. Additionally, we received notification of our supervisory capital strength test results, including the primarily stress capital buffer, which will remain at 2.5% for the fourth quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025. We expect to maintain our common equity Tier 1 ratio consistent with current levels over the near-term. This level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet proposed regulatory changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend and repurchase shares commensurate with earnings. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Maybe just walk through some of the key drivers of the updated NII guidance. You're expecting some nice growth in the second half, and given that the Fed cuts won't be a material driver. Maybe just talk a little bit about the magnitude of the growth you're expecting? And can you maintain that pace beyond the second half and what does all this mean for where you think the margin can head over the medium term? David Turner : So as we had mentioned last quarter, we're neutral to short term rates. And so the benefit that we see for this quarter, I think, going forward is, how we controlled our deposit costs. So our interest bearing costs were up 3 basis points. So the front book, back book benefit that we're getting is when you add securities and loans about, call it, 175 basis points is now overwhelming the change in deposit cost and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. So we don't really need any cuts to help that. If we get them we get them but we're neutral to that. So we think the driver really going forward in addition to what I just mentioned will be balance sheet growth. And so we think that can help us to continue to grow NII. And when you look at all that we felt comfortable saying we'd be at the upper end of our range. We also did a repositioning trade and that'll help us march towards the upper end as well. So we think we're in pretty good shape. We get a little bit of loan growth for the back half of the year, it sets us up nicely for 2025. Ryan Nash : Maybe as a follow-up on the expenses, the increase in expenses seems somewhat commensurate with the increase in revenue. So can you maybe just parse out how much of the increase in expenses was driven by better revenues? And is there maybe a pull forward of some expenses from next year in order to position you for improved positive operating leverage? David Turner : Really, the increase is attributable to the expected increase in revenue, both NII and NIR that you mentioned. Our expectations for that for the year being at the upper end of our ranges, that's the primary driver. Also impacting the full year, we have about $20 million in expenses associated with market value adjustments on HR assets. And so that is what it is, we'll see if that reverses or not. And to a lesser extent, we experienced some modest incremental increases in the first half of the year, and the opportunities to offset that aren't likely. So it's important when you consider all this, our revenue and expense, that we are firmly committed to generating positive operating leverage over the back half of 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : I was hoping maybe at a top level, you could please speak to the kind of the competitive backdrop for commercial lending. I mean, it seems like it's tough everywhere but it seems like everyone appropriately wants to be in the Southeast. So maybe just the overall competitive landscape. And then maybe if you could also please highlight just sort of in your own words or thoughts what it would take to generate better commercial loan demand at this point? John Turner : So it is competitive, you're right. We're in great markets. We talk about that a lot. And as a result of that, we're seeing more and more competition. We think we're competing well. We believe our business is largely about the quality of our people, the execution of our plan, providing unique ideas and solutions to customers, those things differentiate us. And fundamentally, in our business, we think it is about talent. We continue to recruit across our markets and are having some good success doing that. As a result, we're seeing nice growth in our commercial middle market business, offset by declines in some of our specialized industries groups and in investor real estate, as you might imagine, as those portfolios pay down. But all-in-all, activity is still somewhat muted. Customers remain cautious given some concern about inflation cost, the political environment, just general uncertainty, but activity is improving. Pipelines are stronger than they were a year ago, certainly stronger than they were two quarters ago. And so while we're not projecting much loan growth for this year, we do believe that there is, and we would expect in 2025, I think, to likely see economic activity pickup, reflected by the increase in activity in our pipelines. So yes, it's competitive. We think we're competing effectively largely because of the quality of the teams that we continue to build and the long term relationships that we enjoy, and we'll continue to focus on that. Scott Siefers : And then, David, just a quick one for you. You've done a couple of these incremental balance sheet repositionings, which has been great, especially as they've helped to sort of push up the NII expectation through the year. I think you speak in the deck to opportunities for further ones. Maybe if you could just sort of help put a frame of reference, would we look at similar or sort of [iterative] ones like this, what would be the size of the opportunities, et cetera? David Turner : Yes, I think -- so we continue to look for opportunities like this, that's a good use of capital. We've got our capital ratio kind of where we needed to be. So to the extent we can use our capital accretion through earnings for something like this, it would be good to do. And this is about the size. This is probably the biggest you would see from us. It's in that 10% range of earnings. So we like to take opportunities to do this when our payback period is fairly tight. We like three years and in, this one -- the first one was 2.1 year payback period. This one was 2.6. And so if we could get an opportunity to do something in that three and one we might do that -- we may take advantage of that. The curve continues to steep and that really gives us an opportunity to take advantage of it as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : A question on the deposit side, just I think the plus 3 basis points on the interest bearing cost was probably a lot better, a lot lower than people thought. Just wondering if you can kind of talk us through what you're seeing underneath there in terms of where you're continuing to see some back book catch up and where you're starting to see the ability to kind of change price and how you kind of build that into that forward expectation? David Turner : So our cumulative beta is 43%. We've said we'd be in the middle 40s, so call it 43% to 45%. We feel confident in that, because we understand our customer base. There still was some remixing going on. But because the industry didn't have a lot of loan growth the demand or the aggressive competition for deposits just has not been there. And we have to be competitive with our deposit rates and we think we are. We've been very short on things like CDs to take advantage of when we think rates may actually go the other way. So we have a lot of confidence though that it may tick up -- the deposit cost may tick up depending on how the mix shift happens. Continuing to grow core checking accounts and operating accounts is really important to us. And as a result, I don't think you're going to see a major change in our deposit cost. And therefore, our cumulative beta in that 45% range, I think, is important. Ken Usdin : And then just a follow-up on just credit. Great to see the NPAs come down and also understanding your point that the few couple credits are fully reserved for. Can you just flush out your just general points on just how asset quality feels, what you're just seeing in underlying migration and any things that you're still just kind of watching out underneath the surface for the most? John Turner : So we've indicated, I guess, for a couple of quarters that we thought our credit metrics would likely peak in the second quarter. And I think that's proven to be true. We've highlighted a couple of industries that we've been concerned about now for, again, a couple of quarters that's obviously asset classes, office, senior housing, transportation, manufacturing of commercial non-durables, information, are areas that we are following. The particular portfolios where we think there's been some systemic impacts, specifically office transportation, senior housing. Senior housing seems to be improving. Transportation still in a recession, particularly for those smaller transportation companies that are operating in the spot market but that may be improving modestly as well. Office, we're still working through really credit by credit. And we talked about office, we have 101 credits and about 40% of those are -- they are single tenant. So we're really working on about 60 to 70 relationships that are multi-tenant. We think we have a good handle on that exposure and are continuing to work through it. With respect to our guidance, our non-performing loans are centered in 20 credits that represent about 72% of our total non-performing loans. Five of those are office related. And in every case, we're working with a customer. In some instances, we're adding additional collateral to support the credit. We may be getting some additional tenant improvement money. We've got, I think, a pretty good approach to resolving the credits. We know -- we believe we are well reserved. Just as a point, we've been asked about our allowance. Allowance against our multi-tenant book is about 9.6%. Total allowance against our office book, 6.4%. So we feel like we're adequately reserved against the portfolio and we just have to continue to work through them. So our guide is charge-offs toward the upper end of a 40 to 50 basis point range, that reflects the fact that we do have some large exposures. The issue is we can't predict the timing. And so we'll expect these things will get resolved over the next two quarters, they may or they may not, but we continue to work on it. Otherwise, the level of downgrades and upgrades is sort of coming into equilibrium, which indicates again that we think we've reached a point of some stabilization in our credit metrics, should potentially see them go a little higher, go a little lower, they will ebb and flow, but we think we've reached a point of stability. Dana Nolan : Does that complete your question? Ken Usdin : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Following up on Ken\u2019s question on deposits. You're telling us and you've always had a good view of -- and you know your consumers [indiscernible] very well. I'm wondering as we contemplate these rate cuts, how we should expect sort of deposit balances to behave and then what the betas could look like? And David, if you could sort of break it down in terms of how you expect the betas in the commercial versus betas for consumer and also the [speed], it could be helpful as well. David Turner : Erika, you broke up a little there, but I think it's kind of what do we think betas will look like as rates come down. So we do have a schedule in our investor deck. It's a good one for everybody to look at. It's on Page 18. And so we really have three buckets of deposits, if you will, with different beta assumptions in all three of these buckets. So in general, we expect a mid-30% down rate beta. And so if you think about 35% of those accounts reprice with the market so they're tied to an index or their short-term CDs. So we kept our tenors fairly short, call it, five months. So that as rates came down, we would have a chance to reprice that. And then the beta for those is somewhere between 80% and 100%. If you go to the other end of the spectrum, we had about 46% of our deposit base. It was low beta, low cost, never moved up, probably not going to move down. And so that beta is going to be very low, because it never actually increased. And we have about 19% that\u2019s kind of in the middle that we think is, call it, 20% to 30% beta. And so we structured our deposit book to really take advantage of rates as they come down. And we\u2019re only factoring in, even though on the up rates, we had 45% beta, as I mentioned earlier. We've only factored in our guidance to have 30% as down rate. It could be better than that but the 30% comes from that math that I just walked you through, which again is on Page 18 of our Investor Day. Erika Najarian : And it's been a while since we've had sort of had a level, where we stopped at when there has been an easing cycle that's above zero. And historically as we -- and I'm sure everybody's thinking about this as they're seeing through 2025 net interest income. Historically, where do you price relative to Fed funds? Do you price it -- if Fed funds ends up being at 3.50%, 3.75%, are you usually 50% of that in terms of where your deposit costs set up settle out? Is it better, is it worse? I'm just trying to think about. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty as to what the ultimate rate path is going to be. But obviously we need help because we haven't had an easing cycle that didn't end at zero for some time. David Turner : Yes, I think a little more globally and in terms of kind of fed funds and where do you think terminal fed funds are going to be 2.5% to 3% is kind of our best guess. When we get there? Who knows. And in that, with a normal yield curve where Fed funds are 2.5% to 3%, our balance sheet structured to have a margin that's going to be in the 3.75% range to maybe 3.80%. And so that's our expectation. We think as rates start to get cut from here and we have a normalizing or less inverted yield curve then our margin can pick up. We said we'd exit at 3.50% and then we should start to climb as our managed risk partners should start to increase a bit as we go through 2025 and beyond. But kind of the steady state for us would be 3.75% to 3.80% with the fed funds that's 2.5% to 3%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, maybe David just looking at the Slide 18 with the historical sort of net charge-offs. Is it safe to conclude that absent recession 50 basis points of charge-offs should be sort of the high end in a non-recessionary environment? I understand any given quarter can move around. But generally, is there any reason why charge-offs could be elevated even in a non-recession going forward than what we've seen, I guess, over the last 10, 11 years? John Turner : I mean, we don't believe so, Ebrahim. We have had a little change in the composition of our loan portfolio, since the pre-COVID timeframe. We acquired Ascentium Capital. We've acquired EnerBank. We believe we have a good handle on what those relative charge-offs or the contribution to charge-offs will be, but we're observing that, obviously, as we operate those companies. We have grown our presence in the corporate banking space. So as we've talked about before, we are taking some larger exposures, that's intentional, helps us as we think about growing our capital markets business being more important to customers. And so from time to time, as you acknowledge, we could have a large charge-off that would impact the numbers. But generally, we believe based on all our observations that the 40 to 50 basis point range is historically appropriate and where we should operate over time. Similarly, non-performing loans somewhere between 80 and 100 basis points is a reasonable range. We may be a little higher -- a little lower from time to time, I wouldn't expect us frankly to be much higher. But that's kind of our view of what our credit metrics will look like given the composition of the portfolios that we currently have. Ebrahim Poonawala : And I guess, I think I heard you say in your prepared remarks that pipelines, lending pipelines are beginning to pick up. Give us a sense like do we need rate cuts for that pipelines to begin to translate or do we need to get through the elections in order to get things going? Like what would be the driver to get customers off the sidelines start borrowing? And also give us a sense of just from a [office] standpoint, where is the bank hiring? Obviously, there's a lot going on across your markets competitively. What -- where are we investing in terms of branches or hiring of bankers, et cetera, that would be helpful? John Turner : So maybe I'll work backwards. We're investing in markets like Atlanta, Nashville, Houston, Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, where we either have had a significant presence over time and see an opportunity to grow or have made investment like in Houston. And so the first three or four markets, we've been there for some time. We have a strong presence. We're continuing to build on that. Markets like Houston and Dallas, we're making investments to grow and see real opportunity there. With respect to your question about pipelines, I think, I'm trying to remember the question now. I see, somebody help me\u2026 Ebrahim Poonawala : Yes. What would be the catalyst for like when you talk -- speak to your customers, pipelines are building. Is it rate cuts, is it\u2026 John Turner : So I think, eliminating uncertainty, but cost is the bigger issue. I spent some time this week talking to one of our customers who is a large supplier of construction materials and he indicated that they're getting a lot of requests for bids, they're completing a lot of bids, but they're not seeing a lot of work awarded. And I think that's consistent with the fact that costs are still high, whether it\u2019d be interest cost, labor cost, cost of materials. And it is costs that make things somewhat uneconomic or create more risk than customers are comfortable with. And so, I think we need to continue to see adjustments in pricing. At the same time, I expect that our customers will continue to adjust their operations to accommodate changes in pricing. I think that's the bigger factor. The election probably has some impact on just uncertainty overall as do the broader geopolitical events that are occurring. But I believe it's probably more likely interest rates and costs will be the catalyst as those things come down for more economic activity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Just on the expenses, the guidance kind of towards the upper end of the range. Is that just because the fees are coming in higher or anything else in terms of like increased investment spend to top that off as well? David Turner : As I mentioned earlier, the increase is largely attributable to the expected increase in revenue both from a net interest income and non-interest revenue standpoint. And we also had $20 million in expenses associated with the market value adjustments on HR related assets, that was a piece. And to a lesser extent, we've experienced some modest incremental increases in the first half of the year, and opportunities to offset that just aren't likely. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are committed to generating positive operating leverage in the second half of this year. Matt O'Connor: And then as you look out a little bit longer term, I'm not trying to pin you down '25, but just call it like the medium term the next couple of years. What do you think is a good underlying expense growth as we think about some of the positives you mentioned before like loan growth picking up, maybe the higher capital markets run rate? What would you think is a reasonable level? David Turner : You didn't want to press down to '25 but you added '26 on there. Every year we go through a challenging discussion as to what we think expenses ought to be for our budget and going forward. If you look, we do have a slide in our investor deck that shows that our compound annual growth rate since about 2016 is a little over 3%. We try to keep it to 2.5% if we can. We've had some labor inflation as everybody has over the last couple of years. And obviously, technology costs continue to go up. So I would expect us to be somewhere, Matt, in that 2.5% to 3% range. And not committing to that just yet, we'll give you the guidance for '25 in January, but that should give you at least a start. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo. Chris Spahr : So this is just a follow-up I think to Ebrahim's question. So you\u2019ve had a good -- you are on pace and have a good mid single digit or 7% growth I think in core fees this year. What do you think Regions can achieve over the next two to three years with all the tactical hires you've kind of made and when they start monetizing? And iff fees are about 33% of revenues, what do you think that could be in three to five years? David Turner : Well, we continue to look for ways to generate fees by offering products and services that our customers value and need. And so you've seen us do several acquisitions to that end. We're trying to stay committed to generating positive operating leverage between growth in NII and NIR and controlling our expense base. So I think we'll continue to do that and expect to generate positive operating leverage in 25%. We'll give you a finer point on that again in January. But if we could have a little higher percentage of our fees, we've always said we would like to have revenue 50/50 between NII and NIR. We've been saying that for a long time and been able to get there. But if we could increase that, call it, 40% of our revenue and fees that'd be great. We've overcome an awful lot of consumer fee declines, whether it'd be interchange through Durbin, OD fees and the like. And we've made investments in other products and services that have helped us, including treasury management investments that we've made where we've been up, call it, 7% to 10% three years running now. So wealth management continues to grow. They had a great quarter this quarter hit a record as a matter of fact. So we're going to continue to look for ways to generate fee growth that offset some -- we have some potential impacts if Durbin gets updated, we've given you that information. So I think it's incumbent upon us to continue to look for ways to continue to grow. Chris Spahr : And then regarding capital on Slide10. Just do you have any kind of target or aspirational target that you have for CET1 all then if it's 8.2 at quarter end? David Turner : So we have a capital range -- operating range of $9.25 to $9.75 on CET1. We've increased that to 10 point -- this quarter, 10.4%. The reason for that was partly uncertainty with the economy and then uncertainty with regards to Basel III and what that was going to mean to us. We have seen the draft of B3 that as has everybody. And we think we're within striking distance of whatever the ultimate Basel III is going to be. And so we don't need to let our capital continue to accrete higher from here. And as a result, if we generate income, we'll continue to pay a fair dividend. We will continue to look for ways to reposition our securities portfolio if that makes sense. And if all else doesn't work then we'll buy our stock back. And we've done all three of those things this past. And of course, we use that to grow loans as well. And you should look for us to continue that. And so the capital of CET1 of 10.3%, 10.4% is about where you should expect it to be going forward, until we ultimately get Basel III. Chris Spahr : So that implies you were kind of -- there was a decline in your buybacks in the second quarter. So we should expect a meaningful increase in the third and fourth quarter? David Turner : Well, commensurate with earnings and if we -- the reason that we had changed, we used a bit of that capital for the $50 million pretax loss we took on the securities repositioning. So it's all predicated on how big, if any, of our capital generation will we use for that. The buyback is nothing more than what it takes to solve for getting us to 10.3% to 10.4% common equity Tier 1. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : John, you and I have talked in the past about pipelines and you emphasized that they are stronger today than they have been recently. And I know it's hard to quantify this. But can you give us any kind of subjective opinion that these pipelines, the pull through could be even better than in the past or any color there? John Turner : I don't know that I have an opinion, Gerard, that it would be any different than our historical experience. I do think that -- and we are seeing, as I said, pipelines build. We have seen some softness in some of our specialized businesses and those pipelines, in particular, are beginning to improve, particularly in areas like energy as an example, financial services, where we also include our subscription lines and our -- that would be comprised of our insurance book of some of the businesses where we're lending to customers who actually lend to others. We've got some strong relationships in consumer finance that have been really good over time. But I can't tell you that I believe necessarily that we're going to see any change in pull through rates. Gerard Cassidy : And I know, David, you've given us very good detail on the CET1 and uses of capital for buybacks of the securities repositioning. Possibly, John or David or both of you, can you give us your views on acquisitions? I know you, over the recent past, have done non-depository acquisitions of course. But when you look out over the next two or three years, there's likely to be more banking consolidation. How do you kind of look at that outlook for Regions? John Turner : We have said, historically, that we've not been interested in depository acquisition. We've obviously made a number of non-bank acquisitions that have added to our capabilities, helped us grow and diversify our revenue, and we continue to look for those. We believe that we have a really solid plan. If we execute our plan that we can generate top quartile returns for our shareholders. Without doing any bank M&A, it's disruptive, it's challenging. We certainly have over time through our performance improved our positioning. Our currency is much stronger than it was six, seven years, 10 years ago. But we still don't think that bank acquisition necessarily is in our future. It's not part of our strategy today. As I said, it's disruptive, it's complicated. And frankly, if we just execute our plan, we think we can deliver great results for our shareholders. That's not to say we won't follow what's going on, we'll pay attention and we will continue to observe the market. But today, we're focused on executing our plans. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Back to credit, your ACL ratio came down slightly this quarter by about a bit. And just given what you're seeing on the credit front, given your commentary that your trends are peaking around this quarter on certain fronts. Where do you see the reserve ratio going from here? If you can kind of walk through the expectations if you could see incremental release on that front? David Turner : So as we stated, if you look at our credit metrics, they're improving. We said our charge-offs would be at the upper end of our range. And so, those are reserved for. So the expectation would be absent loan growth or changes in economic conditions as those charge-offs come through, you wouldn't expect -- you would expect the ACL to come down. Where it comes down ultimately, which is what I think your question is, it's hard to tell. We have to look at it every quarter and take all the information that's available to come up with the reserve. Something that you can\u2019t look at just as a guide is if you were to go to pre-pandemic or pre-CECL, which was the fourth quarter of '19 and in that scenario, credit was kind of looking pretty good, there was a little bit of a forecasted downturn in the economy at that time, and our absolute CECL reserve was 1.71%. If you take the losses though at that time by portfolio and apply it to our current portfolio, that would equate to a reserve level of [1.61], I think we put that on the bottom of one of our charts. And so you would expect over-time to bleed back-down towards something more normal like that. How fast that gets there, when it can get there? That's impossible for us to tell. But generally speaking, what we know today is that if we have charge-offs coming through in the short term, you should you should see the ACL come down. John Pancari : I know you expected it flat-to-down, but helping frame it like that is definitely helpful. And then secondly, on the expense front as a follow-up to Matt's question, I know you're confident in the positive operating leverage in the back half of this year. And it sounds like you're focusing on positive operating leverage for next year as well. Your long term expense growth rate that you alluded to in your response of 2.5% to 3%, that's a bit above where it looks like consensus is running right now around 2% for next year. I guess, where are you investing in areas that could put you in that 2.5% to 3% range versus anywhere lower? And maybe if you could talk about what that would mean for a longer term efficiency ratio that you should be running at? David Turner : So we're going to give you more pointed guidance for 2025 later. So we're not trying to get ahead of ourselves. Generally speaking, inflation that's baked into our book is going to be closer to that 2.5%, our largest category of expense for salaries and benefits. And so we have to adequately pay our people. And we are also investing in technology, cyber, consumer compliance, all those things take a lot of money to continue to invest in, to improve in all those areas. We have to find ways to pay for that and that's what gets harder as we've -- the low hanging fruit is not there. We've done a really good job of controlling our expense base, we have one of the lowest efficiency ratios in the peer group. We were hoping to get to the lower 50s over time and we think we can do that. But we're going to have to leverage technology better over time than we do today and I think that's going to be true for anybody in the industry. And so by doing that, you have less reliance on labor. And so you can let natural attrition take care of labor as you implement technology solutions. So we're spending, call it, 9% to 11% of our revenue on technology. We have some big technology projects in the works with our new deposit system and new commercial loan system, new general ledger, those take money. We got to figure out how to pay for that and keep our expense run rate as low as we can. So our goal is to try to continue to move our efficiency ratio down from where we are today to get to that lower 50s. John Pancari : And since you mentioned the deposit system, is that still running on plan? David Turner : It's a big project and it's moving according to how we have it laid out, but we've got a long way to go. So we're not there yet. John Turner : Yes, it's running on plan, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I just want to make sure I heard you right on the NIM, normalized NIM in normalized rate environment. So if I heard you correctly, it was -- normalized rate environment starts with the Fed funds that's somewhat similar to inflation, right, like 2.5% and 3%. And you have a steep curve from there or a steep normal curve, not inverted. And in that environment on a full year basis, you're saying that your normalized NIM should be somewhere in the 3.75% to 3.80% range. Is that right? David Turner : That's right. You got it. Betsy Graseck : And that based on the forward curve that would be again sometime in '25 or '26? David Turner : Yes, that's right. Betsy Graseck : And then obviously that's higher than your NIM that you had this quarter. Could you just walk -- and I know you spent a lot of time on the NII and the NIM in the beginning part of the call. I just want to make sure I understand the key drivers that take you from where your NIM is today to that normalized. David Turner : Well, I think as rates continue to come down, our funding cost, our input cost will come down as well. And the power of our front book, back book will continue to benefit us for a couple of years. So with the curve steepening and the repricing of the balance sheet, that's what drives you up from where you are in the 3.50s to that 3.75 range that we just talked about. It's just about what period of time. We think we have our beta down -- I mean, down rate beta in the mid-30s, we think is appropriate, perhaps conservative. And so it's an important driver to get the input cost down. And to continue to grow the balance sheet and grow, we have some high yielding assets that have higher losses, but they have nice returns, nice net interest margins. Continuing to grow checking accounts of a consumer and operating accounts of a business are huge drivers to lowering the input cost on deposits. And so that's why it's so important for us continue to make investments in the markets that John mentioned earlier for both of those reasons in the consumer side and business side to get those checking accounts and operating accounts. Betsy Graseck : So should I read it as you are liability sensitive or do I read it as, you are neutral with these changes that drive the NIM higher or you're asset sensitive but decliningly so as rates fall? David Turner : We're neutral to short rates. And so to the extent, we start seeing rate cuts, then you're going to see our deposit costs continuing to come down. And we still have fixed rate assets, so we\u2019ll continue to help benefit NII and the margin. And what will happen is the curve will steepen. Obviously, if you stay anchored on the long end and short rate comes down and we'll benefit from that as well. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Turner for closing comments. John Turner : Okay. Well, thank you all very much. We are again proud of our quarter, proud of our team that\u2019s executing our plans so well. We appreciate your interest in our company. Have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions' Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding our results. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we reported strong third quarter earnings of $446 million resulting in earnings per share of $0.49. For the third quarter, total revenue grew on a reported and adjusted basis as both net interest income and fee revenue improved quarter-over-quarter. In fact, almost every category within fee revenue experienced growth compared to the second quarter. In line with the growth in revenue, adjusted noninterest expense increased modestly quarter-over-quarter. Average loans remained stable, while ending loans declined slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest customer demand, continued focus on client selectivity as well as further paydowns and credit resolutions in the portfolio. In general, sentiment among corporate customers remains cautiously optimistic. Despite recent interest rate cuts and the possibility of more, customers are hesitant to make capital expenditures until the resolution of the election along with the greater economic and geopolitical certainty. Our focus remains on understanding our customers' evolving needs and providing tailored solutions to ensure we are well positioned to support them when the time is right. Average deposits declined slightly while ending deposits remained stable during the quarter as deposit remixing trends have stabilized. Although certain portfolios within the corporate bank continue to experience stress, overall, our corporate and consumer customers remain healthy and our credit metrics have stabilized. Before wrapping up, I want to take a moment to speak about the recent hurricanes, Helene and Milton. They were incredibly powerful storms and the impacted communities across our footprint face difficult challenges as they begin the recovery process. I'm extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of our customers, fellow associates and communities affected. Regions has a long history of helping communities through challenging times, including natural disasters and we'll continue to support recovery efforts. In summary, we're proud of our third quarter results driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. Our highly desirable footprint, along with the investments we're making in talent, in technology and in products and services are positioning us to benefit as macroeconomic conditions improve. We have a great plan and a leadership team with a proven track record of successful execution. We're on track for a strong finish to 2024 and are well positioned to continue generating top quartile results in 2025 and beyond. Now David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans remained stable while ending loans declined slightly on a sequential quarter basis. Within the business portfolio, average loans remained stable quarter-over-quarter. As John mentioned, pipelines are likely to remain soft as customers continue to seek more certainty on a handful of fronts. In addition, customers continue to carry excess liquidity and utilization rates remain below historic levels. Average consumer loans also remained stable as modest growth in credit card was offset by declines in other categories. We continue to expect 2024 average loans to be stable to down modestly compared to 2023. From a deposit standpoint, deposit balances followed expectations this quarter. Ending levels were stable and averages were down about 1%, largely due to normal summer spending among consumers. Competitive rates declined in advance of the Fed rate cut and consequently customer demand for CD softened, further slowing the rate seeking behavior we experienced throughout the cycle. As a result, the percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits remained stable in the low 30% range. Let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income increased 3% linked quarter, outperforming our expectations. The increase reflects stability and deposit trends together with asset yield expansion. Year-to-date, we have repositioned $3.6 billion of securities, realizing $175 million of pretax losses, resulting in an estimated 2.5 year payback. This includes the incremental sales and reinvestment of approximately $1.3 billion of securities in the third quarter at a $75 million pretax loss. Importantly, the strategy of selling shorter duration and buying longer duration securities has been helpful in maintaining our duration target and has benefited the unrealized loss on the portfolio as interest rates moved lower in the third quarter. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate further repositioning with respect to risk management and capital goals. However, near-term opportunities with attractive payback periods are limited given current market dynamics. Similar to the second quarter transaction, the proceeds of $1 billion September debt issuance were used to purchase the like amount of securities in order to maintain a relatively neutral balance sheet position and bolster liquidity. As expected, interest-bearing deposit costs have peaked remaining flat with the second quarter level at 2.34%. This completes the full rising rate cycle with our interest-bearing deposit beta finishing at 43%, while also maintaining 30% more deposit balances than held prior to the pandemic. Once again, highlighting the funding advantage of Regions' industry-leading deposit franchise. Now as we transition to a falling rate environment, hedging and the ability to reduce deposit expense result in a well-protected profile. Following the initial Fed funds decline, we've experienced a reduction in interest-bearing deposit rates and our exit rate for the quarter amounted to 2.2% consistent with a roughly 30% beta. In the fourth quarter, we would expect further benefit from deposits as term products begin to mature and price lower, equating to a mid-30s beta and neutral sensitivity position in the quarter. Over time, we believe falling rate deposit betas have the ability to drift higher toward those experienced in the rising rate cycle. When coupled with fixed rate asset turnover at higher market yields, this provides the support to grow net interest income in the fourth quarter and beyond. Let's take a look at fee revenue performance during the quarter. Adjusted noninterest income increased 9% driven by improvement in almost every category, most notably service charges, capital markets and wealth management. Service charges increased 5% driven primarily by treasury management semi-annual fees as well as the benefit of one additional business day in the quarter. Capital markets increased 35% due to the increase in M&A advisory fees as well as an increased securities underwriting and placement fees driven by market stabilization. Over time and in a more favorable interest rate environment, we expect our capital markets business can consistently generate quarterly revenue of approximately $100 million, but we expect it will run around $80 million to $90 million in the fourth quarter. Wealth Management increased 5% to a new quarterly record, reflecting increased sales activity and stronger markets. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest income to be in the $2.45 billion to $2.5 billion range. Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 4% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by a 6% increase in salaries and benefits resulting from one additional day in the quarter, increased performance-based incentives and the impact of HR-related asset valuations. The company also recognized $14 million of expense during the quarter associated with Visa's ongoing litigation escrow related to their Class B shares. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. Based on year-to-date results, including outperformance in revenue and elevated HR asset valuations, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted noninterest expenses to be approximately $4.25 billion. Regarding asset quality, as John indicated, overall credit performance continued to stabilize during the quarter. And importantly, our results include the impact of the recently completed SNC exam. Provision expense was $4 million less than net charge-offs at $113 million and the resulting allowance for credit loss ratio increased one basis point to 1.79%. As expected, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased 6 basis points to 48 basis points driven primarily by large information credit and one office credit. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans declined 2 basis points to 85 basis points and business services criticized loans declined $171 million. We continue to expect full year 2024 net charge-offs to be towards the upper end of our 40 basis point to 50 basis point range attributable to a few large credits within our previously identified portfolios of interest. However, those losses are substantially reserved for. Let's turn to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.6%, while executing $101 million in share repurchases and $229 million in common dividends during the quarter. When adjusted to include AOCI, common equity Tier 1 increased meaningfully from 8.2% to an estimated 9.1% from the second to the third quarter. The improvement reflects the benefit to AOCI from lower interest rates and our active management of the duration of the securities portfolio. Additionally, near the end of the third quarter, we transferred $2.5 billion of available-for-sale securities to held to maturity as an initial step to reduce the volatility of AOCI as we transition towards new regulatory expectations in the future. We expect to maintain our reported common equity Tier 1 ratio, consistent with current levels over the near-term. This level will provide meaningful capital flexibility going forward to meet proposed and evolving regulatory changes, along with the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend and repurchase shares commensurate with earnings. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. David, I was hoping you could sort of touch on some of the nuance within NII momentum. And I guess I'll ask just the first and then follow-up question all kind of wrap into one. I think you've previously suggested the margin could push up closer to like 3.60 as we enter next year and then kind of advance from there over the next couple of years. Feels like the fourth quarter might take a little bit of a step back. Does that knock us off the track for the 3.60 and prior path? And then the follow-on is regardless, it still feels as if NII will remain on an upward trajectory. So any updated thoughts on how the pacing looks over the next few periods? David Turner : Sure. Yes, Scott, I think the -- we're still intact with regards to that 3.60. I do think we'll be in the lower part of the 3.50s in the fourth quarter. We're going to grow a little bit in terms of NII as indicated. And then going into 2025, we still have benefit from the front book, back book that's going to benefit us. We've had a little bit of earning asset growth too and continue to control our deposit costs. And of course we have our derivatives that naturally reset. Those are a negative carry this past quarter about $110 million. And so as rates come down, that certainly helps offset lowering rates. So that gives us confidence that we can go into next year and grow the margin. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. David Turner : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Just first on the loan growth side. I guess if you could just give us a little more color of what you're seeing in terms of loan demand. I know you indicated that utilization is running below historical levels. And then given that, what do you see as the catalyst really to be driving material pickup? And maybe how do you think about that pickup materializing when you look at either fourth quarter or 2025? Thanks. John Turner : Yes. So we've said our customers are cautiously optimistic. I would say the environment is generally a positive one. The economy is still good, though slowing. We've seen some growth in middle market commercial and our energy portfolio and asset-based lending. And that's offset by declines in the real estate book as projects are maturing and particularly in the multifamily space paying off, which offsets some of the growth we're experiencing on the business side. We've had a little growth in credit card balances and our interbank originations that's somewhat offset by the declines in mortgages, which experienced in some pay downs there. So I think activity is okay. Pipelines are softer than they were last quarter, but we still feel like we will see some modest possibly growth in loans in 2025 as there's more certainty about the political environment as there's more certainty about the continued direction of the economy, prices begin to moderate a bit. Businesses are still doing well. Balance sheets are strong. Margins are compressing. But customers are still making good money and we think they'll want to invest in their business when it's more clear. We see it have a more clear path later in 2025. David Turner : Yes. John, it's David. I would add that our expectation is for real GDP to be in the 2%, a little over 2% range in 2025. We obviously are in great markets and we think we can take advantage of those when the a little bit of this uncertainty that John just mentioned dissipates a bit and then get on the growth trajectory in 2025. John Pancari : Great. Thank you for that. And then separately, on the expense side, can you maybe talk about your confidence in your upwardly revised expense expectations here. I guess barring the outperformance of revenue on the fee side, do you see other risks that could pressure expenses higher again beyond revenue related? And then how does that influence your expectation for a positive operating leverage next year? David Turner : Sure. No, once you get to this close to the year, the expense estimate is, we're pretty tight on that. We just don't see anything that could take us out of the what we've given you from an estimate standpoint. And we're set up, we've done a good job of managing our expenses. It's an everyday thing for us. We continue to look at expense savings opportunities because we want to use some of those savings to reinvest in our business to continue to grow, which is sets us up for growth in 2025. And, yes, we will generate positive operating leverage in '25. So we kind of don't see anything that's really could create major uncertainty in the fourth quarter in particular. John Turner : Yes. Our largest expense, obviously, is salary and benefits, and that's controllable as we calm the investments that we're making. We have a big technology project underway, as you know. We believe that project is on track, on budget, and so don't have a lot of concern about that at the moment either. John Pancari : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess first question around credit. I think, David, you mentioned the charge-offs towards the higher end sectors you've talked about. Just maybe if we look forward, given where the economy today is, where your customer base is, do you think the charge-offs remains sticky in that 40% to 50% range or do we actually see a stair step function decline at some point over the coming quarters? John Turner : Yes. Ebrahim, we look back historical, at our historic performance. It's been kind of an average of 46 basis points of charge-offs prior to the pandemic. And we've indicated, we think based upon the composition of our portfolio that our charge-offs will range somewhere between 40 basis points and 50 basis points. On average, there may be a quarter where they're modestly higher because of large exposures, maybe a quarter where they're lower because better performance, particularly in the business portfolio. But we are seeing a really good consumer credit performance right now and I feel good about that. And again based upon the composition of our portfolio and our historical performance, we think that 40 basis point to 50 basis point range is really typical. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And I guess just one question, maybe for David, around deposit pricing. I'm just wondering did the signaling by the Fed with the first 50 basis points rate cut, given enough ammunition to actually flex deposit costs lower even if assuming we don't get a November cut or do you think every incremental rate cut is much needed in order to be able to bring deposit cost lower? David Turner : No, I think you should continue to expect the deposit cost to decline into the fourth quarter. We have several things working, some maturing CDs that are in that 4.25, 4.50 range going on today closer to 4. We had an exit rate. We put in the script interest-bearing cost being 2.20. So if you look at where we were for the quarter, it was 2.34. So that gives you the indication that you should continue to see the benefit of that coming down even if we don't get another cut. Now obviously more cuts would be even further reduction in cost, but you also have to factor in the reinvestment yields on the asset side too. So we think we're well positioned back to the first question that we got from Scott in terms of NII. We think we can continue to grow NII and the resulting in the fourth quarter and into '25. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. John Turner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. John Turner : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. David, I'm sorry for another question on deposit repricing. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of the cadence over the next several quarters. So obviously some of the maturing retail and index deposits will reprice more immediately. Now how should we think about once the easy stuff has repriced, how we can look forward to deposit repricing going forward? And maybe think us through if we haven't seen a neutral rate that wasn't zero in such a long time. What is your typical deposit spread when the neutral rate has a level like 2.75% and 3%? David Turner : Well, there's several questions baked into there. So if you look at maturities, that was the first part of your question. We have right at $3 billion that will be maturing here in the fourth quarter between our retail customers, which is probably 2.5 of that number. And then we got some wealth and small business customers. But we're not seeing the flight for yield as much as we had been. And so that's dissipating. And as I mentioned earlier, our CDs of 4.25 to 4.50 that are maturing, new rates for CDs are closer to 4. Still trying to keep the duration tight. I guess, the average is probably closer to 5 months now with this expectation as rates were going to come down, we would have an opportunity to take care of it. From a money market standpoint, you can see a lot of the deposit shift that came out of NIB went into money market. We can continue to challenge those rates pretty quickly. And so I think we have a mechanism to be able to adjust our rates pretty quickly. At 3% Fed funds, you're talking about deposit costs in the 1% range. So a couple of hundred basis point spread between those two. I think it was -- John Turner : Total deposit costs. David Turner : Total deposit costs. Yes. Erika Najarian : Got it. Very helpful. That includes -- you mean including noninterest-bearing? David Turner : Yes. Our total deposit costs. John Turner : Yes, including noninterest-bearing. Erika Najarian : Perfect. And John the second question is for you. A lot of the remaining challenge, so to speak, stories in banks have often been management teams and board and doing underinvestment of predecessors. And you guys have always hit the right balance of efficiency and investment. As we think about the setup for next year, David mentioned the NII trajectory, if we remove the election uncertainty, I suspect that your fees will benefit as well in 2025. Should we calibrate our expectations for expenses relative to revenue rather than just resetting it flat to up 1% or whatever it is. In other words, should the street just expect, okay, what can Regions generate revenue-wise in a better environment and just expect positive operating leverage from there? John Turner : Yes, I think at the end of the day, we're committing to positive operating leverage in 2025. A lot of what we do is we look at the revenue generation we're going to have. We have our core expenses. We're constantly challenging and we're trying to figure out how much we can free up for investment because the more we can free up and investment, it's not just technology and cyber or consumer compliance, it's people. It's putting more people on more boots on the ground in the markets that we want to continue to grow in, but we have obviously a cap in terms of how much we can do based on the revenue generation that we have. So we need to generate positive operating leverage. We think that creates shareholder value over time. And if we can generate more revenue, then we can use a bigger piece of the expense base to make those investments, but that's where it gets calibrated to come back to generate positive operating leverage. David Turner : I would just add, Erika, we're committed to finding ways to eliminate expenses to use those monies to finance investments in our business. And if you look at treasury management, as an example, we've grown relationships by 5% year-over-year and revenues up 18% year-over-year. In wealth management, where we've been adding some wealth bankers and we expect to do that again next year, relationships are up 9% and assets under management are up 9%. We finally have, I think, capital markets back on track and that business is continuing to grow. It's been a great growth story for us since 2014 when we began expanding our capabilities there. Mortgage is an area where we're making some investment as we believe that business will improve. And then small business, we think, is an opportunity across our footprint. So we believe we have a number of pathways to grow and we intend to finance the investment in that growth through expenses, eliminating expenses that will allow us to make those investments. Erika Najarian : Perfect. Thank you. David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you guys could talk about the cards and ATM fee line. I know it's just a few million dollars down in 2Q and not like all as impactful of the overall picture. But it was down and I was just looking at how it's been down 6 of the past 7 quarters year-over-year. And just remind us what's going on there. Thanks. David Turner : Yes, Matt, that's so you want to pick on the only one that didn't grow, okay? That's just really a volume thing and a mix between credit and debit and it depends on what season you're in. You can get a little bit of noise and all that. There's nothing systemic there that shouldn't enable us to grow that over time. So there's not a big story there. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And it does seem like the risk of debit card interchange reform has quieted down. So is that a line item that you're hopeful of growing in the future? David Turner : Yes, I mean the way to grow that is to continue to grow customers. And so we focus on growing checking accounts and the more checking accounts we get, more cards we have in people's hands. And I think, again, being in the markets that we're in are going to give us the opportunity to do that, especially as we invest in people that I just talked about. So, yes, I think that's opportunities to grow. You do point out that there is a risk there in terms of the debit interchange rules. If that goes through, it has quieted down. We don't know that it there's no law that says it has to change at all from where it is right now. So we're going to continue to monitor that. But right now we don't count that as something that will happen in 2025. John Turner : Yes. And Matt, I'd just remind you that we've talked about this before, Visa publishes a power score, which is a reflection of consumer customers ' debit utilization, activation and utilization. And for 42 quarters in a row now, Regions' customer base has been first in terms of power score. We have a customer base that's very actively uses their cards, particularly debit cards. And so to David's point, as long as we can continue to grow households, put more cards in customers' hands. We believe that there's plenty of opportunity to grow fee revenue associated with that category. Matt O'Connor: All right. That's helpful. Thank you very much. John Turner : Thank you. David Turner : Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. John Turner : Good morning, Betsy. Hey, good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hey, yes, a couple of cleanups here. One just I know we talked a lot about deposit rates. And I'm wondering what's the implication for deposit growth? And how are you thinking about that because of the fuel for the balance sheet, obviously. David Turner : Yes, it gets back to, again, being in the markets that we're in, a lot of migration of people and businesses into our markets. We're making investments in people. And our core strategy of our company has been focusing on growth and checking accounts of a consumer and wealth and operating accounts of a business, including small business, where we're really kind of putting more effort on that than we have in the past. We're up about 30% since the pre-pandemic in terms of deposits since 2019. And so we think we have a good opportunity to grow. We have to be competitive with rates, Betsy. I mean we're not trying to just be the low-cost provider. We're trying to be fair and balanced and we think we've done that. And so we're going to have our opportunity to grow. On the corporate banking side, we've managed about $8 billion of cash off balance sheet for our customers. And we're not paying the rate that they would want. We get it for them and we get a little fee for it. But if we ever needed the liquidity for that, we could increase our rates and grow there. But we hadn't had to do that. What we want to do is make sure we're balancing deposit growth and loan growth to maximize our net interest margin. Betsy Graseck : Sure. Okay. No, that's helpful color, and I appreciate the $8 billion there in the corporate banking. The other question I just had is on the investment spend in capital markets, specifically, is there anything in capital markets that you're thinking about investing more into power that line? And what I'm thinking about, I'm wondering is the private credit piece of the ecosystem here does continue to grow and there are opportunities for banks to help originate source, structure et cetera. And I'm wondering, is that an area that you would be looking to invest in or you would say absolutely not, there's other things that we're focused on. Thanks. John Turner : I think we're following the developments in the private credit space. And there are a couple of different models that are emerging. They're all new. And so we'll follow that with some interest, but we don't have any specific inclination at this point. Much of what we're seeing so far in the way of private credit origination in our markets are things that we're nice to doing. So higher leverage, less covenants, just originations that don't interest us at this point. But again, we're following that development closely. In terms of capital markets, we've made some great investments. We want to continue to optimize those, seeing the benefits as an example of our investment in small and real estate originations, placement revenue. Separately, our M&A advisory platforms, both Clearsight and BlackArch rare doing well. I think we have opportunity to take advantage of the investments we've made and to look to potentially add some capabilities around the fringes either add-ons to those businesses or potentially some fixed income sales and trading capabilities over time. But we don't have any burning desire to do anything other than execute well on the investments that we've made so far. Betsy Graseck : Perfect. Thank you so much. John Turner : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to John Turner for closing comments. John Turner : Great. Well, we appreciate your participating in our call today. Thank you so much for your interest in our company. Have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin. Dana Nolan : Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions' fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding our results. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, today's prepared remarks and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John. John Turner : Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This was a year of records at Regions, with our performance driven by consistent focus on superior service as well as soundness, profitability and growth. Our Capital Markets and Wealth Management businesses, as well as our Treasury Management products and services, all generated record revenue in 2024. This morning, we reported strong full year earnings of $1.8 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $1.93, and a top-quartile return on average tangible common equity of 18%. We continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, solid capital liquidity positions and prudent risk management. Additionally, our proactive hedging strategy, investments in fee-generating businesses, desirable footprint and granular deposit base support our ability to deliver consistent, sustainable long-term performance and position us for growth in 2025 and beyond. We are fortunate to be in some of the best markets in the country. Our core markets are foundational to our deposit advantage and have supported growth that exceeds the rest of the U.S. And we've achieved this growth while maintaining peer-leading deposit betas in a top five market share in 70% of our core markets throughout our 15-state footprint. We also have a presence in some of the fastest-growing markets in the country. Investments across these priority markets create significant future growth opportunities for Regions. Population growth across our footprint is expected to more than double that of the U.S., but it's even more pronounced within our priority markets with expectations of growth of more than 3 times the national average. Importantly, we've already established a pattern of success in these markets, growing deposits by $12.5 billion since 2019 and outpacing the market. We plan to build on this success with incremental investments, further supporting growth and extending our advantage. We believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage these advantages as they are underpinned by our longstanding presence across our footprint where, in many areas, we've operated for more than 100 years. This rich history has allowed us to invest in the communities we serve and build a strong brand and a loyal customer base. So, you'll see us continue to strategically invest in talent, technology and markets over the next several years to drive growth and generate efficiencies. We're excited about our growth prospects. However, we'll continue our track record of judicious expense management. Over the next couple of years, we expect to invest in bankers across all of our segments, Corporate Banking, Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Specifically, we plan to add approximately 140 bankers across our product sets, treasury management bankers, mortgage loan officers, commercial relationship managers, as well as wealth management associates. These additions are expected to focus primarily within our eight priority growth markets. Additionally, within the Consumer Bank, we'll lean into our demonstrated successes with regard to capital allocation to better align resources throughout the branch network, specifically focusing on priority markets and branch small business. We'll also invest in enhanced online and mobile capabilities to take better advantage of the deposit opportunities presented by the 12 million small businesses located within our footprint. We've already experienced branch small business deposit growth of $2.6 billion or 30% since 2019 and $1.1 billion or 41% growth occurring in our priority markets. We believe these enhanced capabilities and focus will allow us to capture additional market share over time. Putting this all together, we're excited about the momentum we have going into 2025. We have a solid plan for growth, a highly desirable footprint and a leadership team with a proven track record of execution, setting us up, we believe, for top-quartile results in 2025 and beyond. Before I hand it over to David, I want to thank our 20,000 Regions associates who put customers and their needs at the center of all we do and focus on doing the right things the right way. They are the driving force behind the successful execution of our strategic plan and I'm proud to call them teammates. With that, I'll hand it over to David to provide some highlights regarding the quarter and the year. David Turner : Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans declined modestly on a sequential quarter and full-year basis. Within the business portfolio, average loans [increased] (ph) modestly quarter-over-quarter as our customers continue to carry excess liquidity, and utilization rates remain below historic levels. However, client optimism is improving and further clarity surrounding tax reform and tariffs is expected to be a catalyst for business activity and lending. As a result, it will probably be the second half of the year before we see the impact filter through to the economy. As John noted, our footprint provides us meaningful advantages. For example, within our footprint, there is $77 billion of federal infrastructure spending already approved and allocated at the state level, which will benefit customers in infrastructure and infrastructure adjacent industries. We're also encouraged that pipelines and commitments are trending up. As a result, we expect a notable pickup in C&I lending in 2025, but this will be partially offset by continued softness in commercial real estate origination. Average consumer loans remained stable in the fourth quarter as modest growth in credit card was offset by declines in other categories. For full year 2025, we currently expect average loan growth of approximately 1% as we continue our focus on risk-adjusted returns. From a deposit standpoint, both ending and average deposit balances grew modestly quarter-over-quarter, consistent with normal year-end seasonality. Noteworthy growth occurred in commercial due largely to year-end tax inflows to state, county and municipal customers. Despite modest growth in interest-bearing commercial deposits during the quarter, we remain at our expected mix in the low 30% of noninterest-bearing to total deposits. We continue to believe this profile will be relatively stable in the coming quarters. In the first quarter, we typically see a moderate reversion of the year-end commercial balance increase, offset by some growth in consumer deposits, driven by tax refunds. After the first quarter, overall balances normally grow modestly through the year, which aligns with our baseline expectation. For the full year of 2025, we expect average deposits to remain relatively stable with 2024 as modest growth in consumer deposits is expected to be offset by declines in commercial deposits as customers draw down their excess liquidity. Let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income grew 1% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating a well-positioned balance sheet profile amidst Fed policy easing. The benefits from lower deposit cost and hedging fully offset the pressure on asset yields from lower interest rates. Linked quarter, interest-bearing deposit cost fell by 21 basis points, representing a falling interest rate bearing deposit beta of 34%. We believe our ability to manage funding costs lower even after exhibiting industry-leading performance during the rising rate cycle further highlights the strength of our deposit advantage. Growth in interest-bearing deposits added cash balances and negatively impacted the reported deposit beta, but had little impact to net interest income. Net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.55%, overcoming the pressure from elevated average cash balances, which negatively impacted net interest margin by 3 basis points. Finally, we took advantage of a steepening yield curve in the fourth quarter, executing the repositioning of $700 million of securities at a $30 million pretax loss and resulting in a 220 basis point yield benefit. Today, we have few bonds that can be replaced and meet our interest rate risk and capital management objectives. However, we will continue to reassess going forward. In terms of full year 2025, net interest income is expected to increase between 2% and 5%, building on the growth momentum established in 2024. In the near-term, net interest income will decline modestly in the first quarter due mostly to two fewer days. After this, growth is expected to come from fixed rate loan and securities yield turnover in the prevailing higher rate environment and improving loan and deposit growth backdrop, and the ability to protect net interest income from uncertainty as the path of the Fed rate evolves. Now, let's take a look at fee revenue performance during the quarter. Adjusted non-interest income declined 5% from a strong third quarter. Our full year adjusted non-interest income increased 9%, driven by record Capital Markets, Treasury Management and Wealth Management income. Over time and in a more favorable interest rate environment, we expect our Capital Markets business can consistently generate quarterly revenue of approximately $100 million, benefiting from investments we have already made in capabilities and talent, but we expect it will run around $80 million to $90 million in the near term. Within mortgage, due in part to our experience and cost advantage, we will continue to look for opportunities to acquire additional mortgage servicing rights, building on the $56 billion we've acquired since 2019. We expect full year 2025 adjusted non-interest income to grow between 2% and 4% versus 2024. Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense declined 4% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by declines in salaries and benefits and lower Visa Class B shares expense, reflecting the third quarter litigation escrow funding that did not repeat. Full year 2024 non-interest expenses decreased 4% on a reported basis and 1% on an adjusted basis. We have a demonstrated track record of managing our expense base over time and remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. We expect full year 2025 adjusted non-interest expense to be up approximately 1% to 3%, and we expect to generate positive operating leverage. Regarding asset quality, provision expense was approximately equal to net charge-offs at $120 million, and the resulting allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at 1.79%. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased 1 basis point to 49 basis points, driven primarily by previously identified portfolios of interest. Full year net charge-offs were $458 million or 47 basis points. Non-performing loans as a percent of total loans increased 11 basis points to 96 basis points, modestly below our historical range, while business services criticized loans remained relatively stable. Our through-the-cycle net charge-off expectations are unchanged and remain between 40 basis points and 50 basis points. As it relates to 2025, we currently expect full year net charge-offs to be towards the higher end of the range, attributable primarily to loans within our previously identified portfolios of interest. We do expect losses to be more elevated in the first half of the year, but importantly, losses associated with these portfolios are already reserved for. Let's turn to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8%, while executing $58 million in share repurchases and paying $226 million in common dividends during the quarter. When adjusted to include AOCI, common equity Tier 1 decreased from 9.1% to an estimated 8.8% from the third to fourth quarter, attributable to the impact from higher long-term interest rates on the securities portfolio. We continue to execute transactions to better manage this volatility. Near the end of the fourth quarter, we transferred an additional $2 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity as we prepare for new regulatory expectations. In the near term, we expect to manage common equity Tier 1 inclusive of AOCI closer to our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range. This will provide meaningful capital flexibility going forward to meet proposed and evolving regulatory changes while supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend and repurchase shares commensurate with earnings. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off with the outlook on expenses, the 1% to 3% growth inclusive of investments, David, maybe just talk about where you're getting efficiencies from to create capacity to make these investments? And then second, just given the investments that you're making combined with the comments you made about expectations for C&I loan growth to pick up, what do you think that means for your ability to generate incremental positive operating leverage over time? Thanks. And I have a follow-up. David Turner : Yeah. So, from an expense standpoint, we've mentioned kind of the key categories, 60% of our expense base are salaries and benefits. So, we watch our headcount very carefully, making sure that we deploy the right number of the right people in the right places. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that. That never ends. We continue to look for opportunities to streamline processes and leverage technology, which I think we do okay, but there's more opportunity there. So, managing that headcount is important. Occupancy cost for us is one of our largest categories and we've done a pretty good job of reducing square footage over time, both in the branch footprint, but more so in the office footprint. And that's helped us quite a bit. And then third is, we have a pretty good effort on our vendors, making sure that we use vendors appropriately, whether it's third-party consultants or software vendors or whatever, to make sure that we're getting what we pay for and only getting what we need to have to run the business. So, that's allowed us to make investments in other parts of technology. We're in the middle of putting in a new deposit system and loan system. And so, we've been able to pay for that. And we're going to make investments in people, as John mentioned in his comments. So, if we do all that, we do -- we're going to generate positive operating leverage. Where we end up on that, Ryan, we'll just have to see. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for the color. Maybe to ask about capital, so David, you talked about managing to the 9.25% to 9.75%. Obviously, that's a bit of a moving target with rates. Maybe just talk about what you think that means for the reported capital ratio that you're targeting? And given the limited amount of growth, maybe just talk about how you're thinking about uses of capital and what it means for the amount of capital that you can return over 2025? Thanks. David Turner : Yeah. So, first and foremost, we want to use our capital to grow our business, in particular, loan growth. And -- but we don't want to force loan growth. We want to have it there at the ready. We think loan growth will be fairly slow in the front half of the year and pick up and the back half has more clarity with policy, regulatory policies as well, get clarity. After loans, it's really dividends. We want to target somewhere between 40% and 50% of our earnings to be paid out in the form of a dividend. So, call that 45% in the middle. As we think about AOCI, we believe we need to be within striking distance of our post-AOCI capital number. So that's 9.25% to 9.75%. At the end of this quarter, we're at 8.8%. That can move quite a bit based on the 10 year. And so, we've kind of pegged the 10 year at 4.50% as our base case, by the way. So, we don't have to get to 9.50% immediately, but we want to be close enough to the extent that AOCI does become part of the capital regime. We don't know what the rules are going to be, but we believe that's a high likelihood. Therefore, we want to continue to build that, which means our reported CET1 will continue to increase at some level. We do have buybacks baked into our plan, and it just really depends on what loan growth ultimately ends up being. If we have more loan growth than we have baked in, which is, call it, approximately 1%, if we have more than that, we'd have fewer buybacks. If we have less loan growth, we'll have more buybacks. I do want to remind everybody and I haven't seen many talk about this, but we have the last year of the CECL amortization that goes into the common equity Tier 1 ratio this quarter, and that's, call it, 8 basis points to 10 basis points. So, that needs to be a piece, which means the first quarter buybacks will necessarily be lower than they otherwise would have been, if that makes sense. Ryan Nash : Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. All right. David, I was hoping to get your thoughts on how you see deposit pricing evolving. I know what you're sort of through-the-cycle beta expectations are on the way down, but just curious about any updated thoughts if we indeed sort of stay higher for a while. And then maybe just sort of within the context of the pros and cons that you hopefully listed out on Slide 8 there, just given that a good chunk of your NII momentum this year is kind of programmatic, where are you most focused if you were to sort of stack rank sensitivity to either rates or the shape of the curve versus things like deposit pricing, stuff like that? David Turner : Yeah. So, I'm glad you referenced Page 8. It's our good guide in terms of how we're thinking about our base case and what could drive NII up or down. Deposit pricing is very important to us. Couple of things there. One, we want to be competitive. We want to be fair to our customers and make sure we're giving them a fair price on their deposits. We want to continue to grow deposits. That's why we're making investments in priority markets where we can grow checking accounts, noninterest-bearing checking accounts or operating accounts of the business. And so, as we do that, we'll continue to lower our deposit cost. Our base case is a 35%, call it 35% down beta, which is about where we are. Now, others had more of a move on that because they had a higher beta on a cumulative basis through the cycle. So, ours is necessarily going to be lower, but we also have our hedging that's in place to help protect us. We do have some high-cost CDs that are maturing that will help us from a deposit standpoint, but we do continue to have promotional rates out there in some markets where we're looking to grow and we think that's going to benefit our deposit growth over time. So, it's really a combination of primarily you're really watching your deposit costs and the shape of the yield curve does help us just a bit too. So, a steeper yield curve is better. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Thank you very much, David. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. John Pancari : Good morning. John Turner : Good morning. John Pancari : Just on, if I can go to the loan commentary a little bit again, you mentioned the loan growth about 1% expectation, as you look at 2025. And I know that that's relatively conservative. It looks like relatively low. And you did cite that you're considering risk-adjusted returns in that outlook. Where are you seeing pressure on returns today that are influencing the pace of growth? Is like as you look at it by loan type or by geography, where are you seeing the pressure on returns? John Turner : John, I would say, it's as much about just generally the portfolios. We're always evaluating our loan portfolio and the relationships that we are able to establish with customers or are not able to establish with customers. Oftentimes, we originate credit with an expectation that we'll earn other business opportunities, and over the course of a two-year to three-year period, we don't generate the kind of ancillary business that we thought we would. We don't build a relationship we thought we might. And as a result, we choose to exit those. Much of what we have been doing, I think as you know, over the last seven, eight years is continuing to focus on capital allocation, remixing our business, exiting certain portfolios, relationships that don't generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns to us and reallocating that capital in the business. And that is a discipline that we have. We think has serviced really well and is a primary reason why we're able to generate consistent sustainable returns today. David Turner : John, I'd add to your opening comment on the 1%. There are a couple of different stories there. So, our C&I growth is quite robust, I think, given the market of little over 3%. It's the investor real estate that'll be more challenging this year and then consumer will have some pluses and some minuses. Credit card will grow a bit. We can have mortgage up a little bit. But others -- other parts of the consumer business will be going the other way. So, net-net, it's 1%, but there's different stories in there that we think are reasonable. We want to make sure we lay out our capital that we get the appropriate return on it. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, on the expense guide of 1% to 3%, could you -- does that incorporate an increase in your IT budget? I believe it's currently 9% to 11%, but you had signaled that it might be moving higher. So, does that up 1% to 3% incorporate upward revision to that budget? David Turner : It does. We've continued to make investments. As you know, maybe better than most, we are investing in a new deposit system and loan system. Loan system will go in probably the second, third quarter of this year, and deposit systems a couple of years away, but we're been spending money on that. We're going to continue to invest there. And over time, we do believe that that 9% to 11% range will be higher. We haven't committed to a given percentage right now, but the guide that we have does contemplate those investments already. Those are the things that I'm talking about earlier when I said we have to make investments to grow, to continue to have best-in-class technology, and we have to figure out how to pay for that. And we have to look at salaries and benefits and occupancy and vendor spend as a way to get there. John Turner : I would just say, John, two things about the deposit system conversion. One, it's on track, it's on time, it's on budget. And two, while David indicated we may in the future spend more money on technology, that's what the assumption that we're going to reduce expenses somewhere else. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Great. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Peter Winter : Good morning. John Turner : Hey, Peter. Peter Winter : Just a follow-up on expenses. Just if I think about, John, your opening comments, you outlined a series of investments you plan to make in terms of bankers and future revenue growth. The expense guidance is 1% to 3%. So, the question is, would you pull back on these investments if revenue growth comes in a little bit weaker than expected given this focus on positive operating leverage? John Turner : Well, we're committed to generating positive operating leverage. We believe that we'll make the investments in people primarily, although we also indicate we're making investments in technology along the way, enhancing our mobile platform as an example. We'll make those investments in a measured way and we expect to generate revenue associated with those investments. So, I don't anticipate having to necessarily address your question because we do think the revenue growth will come given the investments we've made and the track record we have in making investments like this which generate positive operating revenue. We are very much committed to positive operating leverage over time. Now, we expect we'll absolutely deliver that in 2025. And if we get to revenue growth, we believe we will -- that will continue in '26 and beyond. David Turner : Yeah. Peter, just to add to that, your question is coming at what point would you abandon positive operating leverage, and sometimes you need to do that because you need to make investments that you can't get paid back for today. That's not what 2025 is going to be about. 2025 has some built-in tailwinds for us in terms of just front book, back book. And the investments we're going to make, we're going to be all over making sure they generate the revenue that we've pro forma-ed. And so, the question isn't about whether we have positive operating leverage, the question is how much. And so, that kind of came at, I think, Ryan's original question. So, we're very committed to that this year and very committed to making investments to grow our business in areas where we think will have disproportionate growth relative to the rest of the United States. Peter Winter : Got it. That's helpful, really helpful. And then, just on credit, you mentioned net charge-offs will be elevated in the first half of the year and then down and lower in the second half. Do you think net charge-offs come in above the upper end of that 40 basis points to 50 basis points in the first half? I understand that it's reserved for. And then secondly, would you expect the ACL ratio to drift lower from 1.79%, which has been pretty consistent in '24? John Turner : Well, the charge-off ratio could drift a little higher than the 40 basis point to 50 basis point range in a given quarter, given that we have a handful of large credits, primarily in office and senior housing and in transportation, which we've signaled. In fact, roughly half of our non-accruals are in those three portfolios. And so, as you think about resolutions, they might be somewhat episodic. We could experience a quarter when charge-offs were little higher than the range. We are, we believe, obviously appropriately reserved for losses in those credits. And so, assuming they get resolved, I think you could also see, absent loan growth, with an improving economy, that our coverage ratios would begin to come down. Peter Winter : Got it. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping to get some details, sorry if you had covered it earlier, but just on some of the other fee categories besides Capital Markets, I don't know if there's seasonality or usually strong 3Q levels, but service charges, card, network management are all down. And so, just any thoughts on what drove it in 4Q and then the outlook on some of those categories? Thank you. David Turner : Yeah. I think, what's baked in, to see some numbers that are baked in for next year that others have, we have this HR asset where we adjust benefits for certain individuals and we have a trust that funds that. So, as the assets and the trust go up, NIR goes up and so do expenses. And that's why we have this little bit of noise in our numbers. That's about $15 million. If you look at Page 14 in our supplement, you can see it quarter to quarter, it's about $15 million we think people put in our run rate that really distorts NIR a bit. As you get to the fourth quarter, the things that are a little bit more episodic are Capital Markets, as you mentioned. So, M&A advisory had a good finish for the year. And it depends on what's in the pipeline in any given quarter. So, you're not going to get a nice smooth quarterly run rate on that caption alone, which is why we finished at $97 million, $98 million in the quarter, for total Capital Markets, we're signaling more $80 million to $90 million-s, which should be baked into expectations. If we close more deals, it'll be higher than that. If we don't close as many, we'll be at the lower end. So, M&A is a bit, like I said, episodic. You have swap income -- people just aren't entering into interest rate protection right now given the rate environment. So that's not much of a contributor. Syndication revenue was up in the quarter. That has been a little bit episodic, but it had a good finish to the year. And then, we have real estate capital markets that's really been our strongest, a more steady contributor. But it can be even better than it was in the fourth quarter depending on rates. If we get rates coming down just a little bit, it actually could have even a better quarter. So, net-net, Capital Markets, I think, $80 million to $90 million for the time being and we're going to work to get it to $100 million, but we need a little help from the rate environment. Service charges are fairly predictable. There is no real noise in anything. Wealth Management continues to grow at double digits, partly due to markets, but partly due to just growth in customers and balances. And we're making investments in wealth advisors to continue on that path. So, we're happy with that. Probably the biggest negative would be in the card and ATM fee line. That's where we have our rewards liability. We started identifying to our customers real time what the rewards liability was when you log on, because we thought that was helpful to them and we believe it's helpful. But as a result of that, people are using their rewards more. So, we had to adjust our reward liability and that was a little bit of a deduct in NIR for the fourth quarter that shouldn't repeat as we go forward into 2025. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Erika Najarian : Hi, thank you. Just going back to Slide 8, David, thank you for all the color on beta in different mix scenarios. I'm just wondering, it's been such a long time since investors have seen a neutral rate that wasn't zero. And as we think about your experience as Regions given your deposit base, how should we think about sort of what you've seen in different rate environments with regards to DDA growth? And I guess I'm wondering how we -- it seems like we've completely lapped the impact of excess COVID liquidity in terms of pressure on deposits. And just, I guess, wondering what is the environment where Regions can see itself growing DDA again. David Turner : Yeah. I think it's a great question, and a very important one because DDAs, consumer DDA and operating accounts of business are the fuel that make our engine work. And we've done a pretty good job of continuing to grow checking accounts. But we're doubling down on investments in our consumer side, our branch small business and our small business in the commercial side and reinforcing to our relationship managers to grow new logos, so that we can get the operating account. It's not about making up the loan. It's about getting the relationship, which is evidenced by an operating account of a business. If we'll continue to do that, we will continue to have more than 30% of our total deposits in noninterest-bearing, which is very valuable to us from a margin standpoint. So, it's not really the rate environment that's the driver of that. It's about us just getting out boots on the ground and getting after it. And that's kind of the challenge that John's put to the businesses. And we're looking forward to seeing what we could do by making the investments at our priority markets that we listed in our material. Erika Najarian : Got it. And the second question, it may be just investment -- continued investments and fee income. David, you mentioned investing in more mortgage servicing assets in 2025. And as you think about perhaps where you could service your clients even better, what are your priorities in terms of fee income investments in '25? And how should we think about that trajectory over the medium term? David Turner : Well, so we ask all of our businesses to take a look at what products or services that our customers need and value that we don't provide. And there's not a whole lot, but you've seen us invest in businesses like Sabal and ClearSight in the business side that have been helpful to us. We don't have a robust fixed income sales and trading platform. It'd be nice if we find something that made sense for us there. You mentioned MSRs. We love to buy RIAs in the wealth group, but they're too expensive. And so, we have to continue to chip. We have the capital to invest in those non-bank-type acquisitions. So, we come up with a product or service that we don't have, we're all over it. And -- but we have to make sure we pay an appropriate price for it. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Gerard Cassidy : Hey, John and David. John Turner : Hey, Gerard. Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : John, you started your presentation with some very impressive economic data and population data and demographics in your core footprint. And at the same time, you and your peers continue to struggle to really achieve good loan growth. Good loan growth, I guess, you could define as the rate of growth of nominal GDP in the area in which you operate. What is it going to take do you think -- because I know you guys have been talking about modest loan growth for some time particularly on the commercial side. What do you think it's going to take to bring loan growth into let's say mid-single-digits for you folks over the next couple of years? John Turner : Well, there are some natural headwinds, Gerard. One is there's just tremendous amount of liquidity in the marketplace. Customers have shrunk their balance sheets, their operating, their working capital needs are less than they were pre-COVID. Customers have figured out how to operate with less inventory, receivables turn potentially more quickly, and they just have a lot of cash. And so, we believe that customers have to put that money to work before we'll see an increase in activity. Having said that, we do continue to expect our commercial lending activity to be pretty good. David talked about 3% projected loan growth. We saw a really nice increase in production year-over-year, but line utilization is still at historically low levels. All that said, we also have to see growth in other portfolios. So, we have some headwinds that are generated by the fact that the real estate business is not growing today, largely new originations due to cost of insurance, cost of borrowing money, cost of supplies and construction. All those things have been a headwind to new originations within real estate. So that naturally offsets growth in C&I. And then, the consumer book is fairly stable. Consumers are still spending money, but probably a little more cautiously than they were. And so, while we're seeing some growth in our card portfolio, our other consumer businesses are fairly stable. I think we have to see some other things beside C&I loan growth in order to experience real overall loan growth in the portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : And John, just tying into those comments, can you give us any color, or maybe David, the acquisitions you guys did a couple of years ago on EnerBank and Ascentium, how are they doing in terms of growing their loan books relative to when you bought them and what you expected they were going to produce? John Turner : Yeah, I think we've been really happy with both acquisitions. I would say Ascentium, which is the older of the two, is a small business loan originator. Their focus has been on business essential equipment. They've been growing that business nicely, but have, over the course of the last, call it, 12 months to 18 months, run up against some pressure, as small businesses are feeling the pressure of increased cost, increased borrowing cost, et cetera. So, they haven't grown as much over the last 12 months as we would expect. We are, however, having really good experience integrating that platform into our branches, so that our branch bankers can use the capabilities that we have within Ascentium. As an example, Ascentium can approve a loan within about 75 minutes. They have really good technology. We can close that loan quickly. And so, we're happy and excited about what that means for growth and small business lending within our branches. With regard to EnerBank, the home improvement finance business, we have a bit of a run off portfolio there and we had some [solar] (ph) originations that the business that we've decided not to continue to grow. And so, as we're remixing our portfolio, so to speak, our portfolios within EnerBank, we don't anticipate a lot of growth there in 2025. But that will come over time. We've been really happy with the quality of the credit in both Ascentium and EnerBank. And we believe that those are portfolios and capabilities frankly given the technology that they have that we can continue to grow over time. David Turner : And to add to that, Gerard, while your question was about balances, both of those portfolios that John just mentioned protect us. They're a natural hedge on a lower rate environment because they're fixed rate lending with much more spread than is typical. Now, it has higher risk, but we get paid and compensated for that risk, which is why we really like both of those businesses. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. I appreciate that. And then, David, you guys, obviously, you and Dana put together some really good slides for your earnings call and we all appreciate that. And I found the Slides 20 and 21 very interesting about your securities portfolio and the information that's provided there. On the held-to-maturity section of the securities portfolio, you show it represents about 14%. And if we assume that and we all don't know all of the details of the Basel III endgame when it is finalized hopefully later this year, but assuming that the available-for-sale unrealized losses will go through regulatory capital, as you alluded to in your comments, where do you think the HTM portfolio goes to? Or are you comfortable just keeping that at the current level? David Turner : Yeah. So, Gerard, you saw that over this past year, we've increased that quite a bit. We were at about 3%, I think, at the beginning of the year. We're at 14% today. We have an interim plan to get to about 25%. We realized that's lower than the peer median still, but we do think that to the extent AOCI does become part of the regime that reducing the volatility of capital relative to changes in interest rates is important for us. So, we think 25% is comfortable enough. You start getting into higher percentages, you really have to think about the interplay with LCR and your liquidity risk management. So, you don't want to hamstring yourself by putting too much in HTM to solve one problem and create another one for you. So, we think 25% just about in any regime is a pretty good starting point. And once we get there, we'll reevaluate and come back to all of our investors and analysts and update that percentage if need be. Gerard Cassidy : And I know you've been very active in the repositioning as you point out in Slide 21. Should we assume in '25 and maybe '26 to reach that targeted number you just gave us that repositioning is likely to be part of that strategy to get there? David Turner : I would say our repositioning, you're not going to see the magnitude of the repositioning in '25 that you saw in '24, primarily because the -- we just don't have the securities out there that are -- that help us make sense for that. We've been trying to take losses with a payback period under three years. I think our last one was about 2.7 years. And we really don't want to go much over that. So, if we have a steeper curve, maybe that makes some sense to us. Our baseline is 4.50% on the 10. We start pushing on 5%, then maybe we have a different answer. In either case, I don't think we're going to have the magnitude of the repurchases that you saw in '24. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Hey, good to chat. Couple of follow-ups here. One, on the expenses, you were indicating that the loan system will go into place this year. What was it? 2Q, 3Q? So, my question... David Turner : That's correct. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Is there -- will there be expense roll-off as it relates to system unwinds? Or is that more of a '26? David Turner : Yeah. I don't think that you'll see any appreciable pickup from that when we get to the third quarter. That's kind of baked into our run rate. So, I don't think there's any change from that going live. Betsy Graseck : Right. But once it goes live, you test it, wait a couple of quarters and then you get to turn off the old system, right? David Turner : We do, but I don't think there's appreciable savings there. I think the new system really gives us an opportunity to serve our clients better as what that's all about. And it's a cloud-based system and I think that it'll help our relationship managers, in particular, serve our customers better. Betsy Graseck : Okay, super. And then, just as follow-up on the question around the bankers. I know you mentioned at the beginning of the call, 140 bankers that you're looking to bring in over the course of the year. I'm assuming that's a timeframe. But can you give us a sense of how does this number, 140, compare to prior years? I'm trying to get a sense of what kind of ramp you are driving in the business, as I'm sure you know, headcount times productivity is revenues. So, looking to understand the ramping here and is this a one year, is this a multi-year, that would be very helpful to understand. Thanks so much. David Turner : Well, you got to the answer at the very end. That's a multi-year. That's, call it, a two-, three-year ramp. That's not -- we're not hiring 140 people in one year. I'm not sure we could hire 140 people in one year. You'll see that really coming on throughout the year, probably towards the middle of the year and the back of the year. That's baked into our 1% to 3%. And so, you shouldn't see this big cliff effect of having all this expense with no revenue. We're going to feather it in so that it makes sense for us. Again, we're committed to positive operating leverage, at the same time, we're committed to growth. So, how we do that and the pace that we do that is going to have to be very measured. So, you're not going to see just all of a sudden, a bunch of people show up on our doorstep. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And I'm just wondering, I'm sure you've been hiring people into this business along the way as well. And you're indicating that you are going to be accelerating the pace of hiring into this space. I'm just wondering, is this a doubling of prior pay, tripling? John Turner : Yeah, I mean depending on the business, Betsy, it'd be 10% to 20% increase in headcount, depending upon the business or function, just by range. Betsy Graseck : Okay, great. That's super. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Christopher Spahr with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. John Turner : Hi, Chris. Christopher Spahr : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Good afternoon. So, this is a kind of a [indiscernible] of the strong footprint and outsized growth you expect and yet, obviously, loans and deposits, it's a lot of recent clients not growing much. What do you think the organic growth rate should be in a more normal environment for both? John Turner : Yeah. Well, we've consistently said, we think we ought to grow -- in our core markets, we ought to be growing with the economy plus a little where we have significant market share and presence. We acknowledge that there are a number of new competitors in the marketplace or indicating they want to come into the marketplace, which makes the business more challenging. But we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to protect our markets, our core markets and grow in those markets. And at the same time, we're excited about the growth markets that we have an opportunity, we've called them priority markets where we have an opportunity to grow our business at maybe a little faster rate relative to our current position there. Christopher Spahr : And I know this was kind of asked a little bit already, but just -- can you just be a little bit more specific on the tech progress? Like, what's the time line when you think you'll be done? And what are kind of the ancillary benefits you may expect to see both just on an operating standpoint, but also an opportunity standpoint? Thank you. John Turner : Yeah. David mentioned, we'll convert to our new loan system later this year and then begin running a pilot on the deposit system in the second half of 2026 with full implementation in the likely the second quarter, first and second quarter of 2027. In terms of benefits, so we think it gives us a good bit more capabilities, faster product launches. We can bundle products. We'll have just -- we think more interesting capabilities. It's cloud-based system. It will allow us to upgrade the system much more easily quickly. And all in all, we think they give us a competitive advantage. Christopher Spahr : All right. Thank you. John Turner : Okay. That's all the questions. Thank you all very much for calling in today. We appreciate your interest in Regions. Have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
