Dall \u2013 Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I\u2019d like to introduce you host for today\u2019s call, Scott Beilharz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Scott Beilharz : Thank you Scott, and good morning, everyone. For the Erie Insurance Group, 2013 was a year of significant milestones. We reached $5 billion in premium last year while recording our fifth consecutive year of market share growth in every state in our footprint.  We delivered solid underwriting profitability and received additional third party recognition for our commitment for serving our customers. We also announced our plans to expand the business into Kentucky, which will become the 12th state in our footprint. I\u2019m pleased to report that we continue to build on that positive momentum in the first quarter of 2014. Highlights of our strong financial performance in the quarter include net income per share for Indemnity of $0.88 compared to $0.69 in the first quarter last year, reflecting strong top line growth and positive year-over-year investment results.  Direct written premium of $1.3 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 7.8% over last year. Our results were driven by both increases in policies in force and average premium per policy along with our strong retention rate of 90.6%. We were on track to outpace Koning\u2019s 2014 industry growth projections of 4.2%. During the first quarter, we continue to build on our operational effectiveness. Our DSpro Web system is now being used in three out of four private passenger auto and home applications. This technology platform for our personal lines products is a key growth enabler and provides our agents a seamless, convenient way to meet their customers\u2019 needs. DSpro Web is an example of the investment we make to maintain strong relationships with our agents. By providing our agents with a well rounded product offering backed by superb customer service, we continue to strengthen our relationship with our agents and their relationship with their customers, a necessity in our highly competitive industry. Regarding customer service J.D. Power has once again recognized Erie Insurance. Last month, we learned that Erie earned second place in the J.D. Power property claim study, which measures customer satisfaction across the property claims experience.  Erie continued to be a high satisfaction carrier due to our prompt initial service contact, high caliber talent, timely payment of claims, and meeting our customers\u2019 needs related to financial recovery and restoration. This is a testament to the skills and effort of our agents and our claims employees, who are truly committed to being above all in service. Additionally, just last week, Erie earned first place in J.D. Power\u2019s 2014 insurance shopping study for highest in customer satisfaction with the auto insurance purchase experience.  This marks the fifth time Erie has earned the award since the annual study began in 2007. This award recognized the success of our agents and Erie employees in meeting high customer expectations, when it comes to the auto shopping experience and overall customer satisfaction. I\u2019d like to take this time to thank our employees and agents for their tireless efforts.  They make Erie the special company it is. We were off to a good start in 2014, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities for strengthening our brand and delivering the service for which Erie is known. Marcia will now provide you with more details into our first quarter financial performance. Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.

Marcia will now provide you with more details into our first quarter financial performance. Marcia A. Dall: Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. As Terry mentioned, our first quarter results continue to build upon 2013\u2019s success. Net income was $0.88 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.69 share per share in the prior year quarter.  This growth was driven by our increased revenue from management operations, lower expense growth and increased equity in earnings of limited partnerships. In our management operations, income before taxes was $58 million, up $9 million over the prior year quarter. Our revenue growth outpaced our growth and expenses increasing our gross margin from 16.1% to 17.9%. Revenue from our management operations grew by $23 million to $326 million. This represents a 7.5% increase over the prior year period and is consistent with the 7.8% increase in direct written premium of the Property and Casualty Group. With the help of our independent agents and strong policy holder retention, we were able to build upon our policy and premium for policy growth from a year ago. In the first quarter of 2014, we delivered policy growth of 4.7% and a 4.2% increase in premium per policy. This performance reflects meaningful growth in both our personal and commercial product line. Cost of management operations grew $14 million or 5.2% to $268 million.  Commission expense grew $10 million or 6% primarily from the increase in direct written premium. This increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in other agent compensation primarily due to a decrease in the projected profitability bonus component. This was a result of factoring in the underwriting results of the Property and Casualty Group for the current quarter. Non-commission expenses increased $4 million or 3.6% over the prior year quarter. This is primarily due to higher personnel costs and policy processing expenses related to business volume growth, partially offset by a decrease in the pension expense. Indemnity\u2019s income from investment operations was up $4 million in the first quarter of 2014 primarily from an increase in Indemnity\u2019s equity and earnings of limited partnerships. As you know, we have a disciplined capital allocation process. We balance our need to invest in the company\u2019s long term growth and our ability to return cash to investors through attractive dividends and accretive stock repurchases. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $30 million for the first three months of 2014. In addition, Indemnity repurchased approximately 145,000 shares of our outstanding Class A common stock at a total cost of $10.2 million during the first quarter. As of April 18, 2014, we have approximately $22 million remaining in our repurchase program. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Terry. Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Thank you, Marcia. We recently held our annual shareholder meeting here at our corporate headquarters in Erie. At the meeting, all 12 members of our Board of Directors were reelected to serve another year. I\u2019d like to express my sincere gratitude to our Directors for their guidance and steadfast commitment to our success. I\u2019d also like to thank our investors for their continued trust and support. Trust is critically important to everything we do at Erie, which is why we are pleased to be included in the Forbes\u2019 2014 list of America\u2019s 50 Most Trustworthy Financial Companies. And even more impressively, if any first among mid cap organizations. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator, to open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Terrence W. Cavanaugh: All right. If there are no questions, I\u2019d just like to thank everyone for their time and interest and participating in this call this morning. As I\u2019ve said in the beginning of this call, we\u2019re off to a good start in 2014 and believe we\u2019re in a strong financial and operational position to build upon the momentum we created in 2013 despite what I might call some uncertain economic time.  We remained focused on creating value for our shareholders through our continued execution of our long term strategy, of delivering a compelling product line with the best service in the industry. Again, thank you all for participating this morning. Scott Beilharz : Thanks, Terry. Thanks, again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website, erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today. If you have any questions, please call me at area code 814-870-7312. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Today I will provide a brief overview of our financials, our perspective on the market, and insight in how we are driving profitable growth over the long-term. Marcia then will discuss our financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2014 in more detail, and then I will provide closing comments. From a financial perspective, Erie Indemnity had a strong second quarter. Reported net income per share was $0.94 versus $0.84 in the second quarter of last year. For the first half of this year, reported net income per share was $1.82, compared to $1.54 for the first half of last year, reflecting strong top line growth and positive year-over-year operating results. For Erie Insurance Exchange, direct written premium increased almost 9%, to $1.5 billion in the second quarter. For the first half of this year, direct written premium was nearly $2.8 billion, an increase of more than 8% over last year. Our results were driven by an increase in both policies in force and average premium per policy, along with our strong retention rate of 90.6%. As you'll see, our combined ratio is higher than we anticipated. This is primarily from the tough year we've had with whether-related events. For me, the real story behind these numbers is how our dedicated team of agents and employees continue to be above all in service, and how they take care of our customers in their time of need. We've already handled roughly 350,000 claims through June, which is nearly 25% higher than at this point last year. Now I'd like to share my perspective on our growth in the market. When we review the market, we use Conning data for the entire U.S. market and then SNL data to measure results specific to our geographic footprint. For 2013, Conning reported industry growth of slightly over 4%. During this period, Erie delivered growth of nearly 10%. Conning is currently projecting premium growth of 4% for 2014. As I mentioned earlier, Erie delivered over 8% growth in the first half of 2014. So we're well on track to once again outpace the industry projection. According to SNL, over the past five years, we've had the second highest market share percentage growth among the top 10 P&C insurers in our footprint. During this period we also grew market share each year in both personal and commercial lines in every state in our footprint. We often get asked how does Erie sustain this kind of premium growth year after year. We believe it comes from the continued strengthening of the relationship with our agents. By having a strong product offering, with excellent coverage and steady pricing, providing exceptional claims and customer services, having target marketing campaigns, and making their lives easier by improving upon processes and systems capabilities. Let me share with you some examples of what we are doing with our products to continue to raise the bar. On the personal lines side, we recently completed the rollout of our enhanced rental car reimbursement coverage. No longer will a customer have to settle for a sedan when what they really need is a SUV. We've also recently completed the rollout of our new homeowners product, which allows customers the flexibility to choose among a variety of coverage options. Whether it's offering guaranteed replacement costs or letting customers vary their deductibles by major peril, we are giving customers the choices they want and deserve by providing the coverage, deductible, and price they prefer. In today's environment, where many personal lines competitors are reducing coverage and mandating deductible amounts, we are proud to be able to allow customers to balance the amount of coverage they select with the premium they pay. We are also enhancing our products within our commercial lines business. For example, commercial customers are under a constant threat of cybersecurity breaches. Cyberattacks aren't just a threat for large corporations, and our small commercial business customers know this, and are now turning to us to help them recover if an attack occurs. We are fulfilling that need with a commercial data breach product that will protect our customers financially if such an event were to occur. We also know how important it is for our small commercial business customers to manage their cash flows. This is why we are not piloting a pay as you go option within our workers compensation line of business. Pay as you go is an additional payment option that allows our customers greater financial flexibility in managing their premiums, and takes away end of the year audit surprises. For the life business, we are very excited that our personal lines web-based quoting system, DS Pro, now has the capability to automatically quote life at the same time as auto and home. Additionally, we are giving our agents and life customers an easy quote option. This innovative tool enables our agents to more easily explain our life products, allowing agents and customers to focus on the life insurance need and protection, as opposed to dealing with stilted life insurance terminology. Our life products are a great complement to our PNC product line, helping to strengthen our retention and build even greater customer loyalty with Erie Insurance. These are just a few examples of our many product enhancements, and how we are making it easier for our agents and customers to do business with us. We will never rest on our laurels in our pursuit to being above all in service. This is a key to our ability to grow profitably at a rate that is faster than the industry over the long-term. We are very proud of our accomplishments, and what that means to our customers. I\u2019d like to thank our agents and employees. Without their unwavering commitment to Erie, we would not be the successful company, we are today. With that, I will now ask Marcia to provide you with more details on our financial performance. Marcia A. Dall: Thank you, Terry, and good morning everyone. As Terry mentioned, net income for Erie Indemnity was $0.94 per share in the current quarter, compared to $0.84 per share in the prior year quarter, reflecting increased revenue from management operations and lower expense growth. In our management operations, income before taxes was $58 million, up $9 million over the prior year quarter. Our revenue growth outpaced our growth and expenses, increasing our gross margin from 17.3% to 18.2%. Revenue from our management operations grew $13 million to $374 million. This represents an 8.7% increase over the prior year period, and is consistent with the 8.8% increase in direct written premium of the property and casualty group. In the second quarter of 2014, premium per policy grew 4.2%. In addition, our strong policy holder retention, and the increase in new policies, resulted in policy growth of 4.5%. Cost of management operations grew $21 million or 7.6% to $306 million. Commission expense grew $18 million, or 10%. Commission growth outpaced direct written premium growth, primarily due to an increase in agent incentive costs compared to the prior year quarter. Non-commission expenses increased $3 million, or 2.8%, over the prior year quarter. Our non-commission expenses for the quarter benefited from a decrease in projected employee incentive plan costs and pension costs. Income from investment operations decreased to $7 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $8 million in the second quarter of 2013, due to lower equity and earnings of limited partnerships. Now let\u2019s look at our results for the first six months of 2014. Indemnity\u2019s net income totaled $95 million, compared to $81 million for the same period last year. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $1.82 per share, compared to $1.54 per share for the prior year. In our management operations, income before taxes grew $18 million to $126 million. The gross margin for management operations for the first half of 2014 was 18%, compared to 16.7% for 2013. Revenue from our management operations grew $53 million to $700 million, an increase of more than 8%. Cost of management operations grew $35 million to $574 million, or 6.4%. Commission expense grew $28 million to $379 million, primarily from the increase in direct written premiums of the property and casualty group. Non-commission expenses increased $7 million, or 3.2%, over the prior year quarter. Our non-commission expenses for the first six months of the year benefited from a decrease in projected employee incentive plan costs and pension costs. Indemnity\u2019s income from investment operations grew $3 million to $18 million for the first half of 2014. Turning to our balance sheet, our disciplined capital allocation process allows us to invest in the company\u2019s long-term growth, while returning cash to investors through attractive dividends and accretive stock repurchases. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $59 million for the six months of 2014. Indemnity repurchased approximately 114,000 shares of our outstanding Class A common stock at a total cost of $8.2 million during the second quarter. As of July 18, 2014, we have approximately $18 million remaining in our repurchase program. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Terry. Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Thank you, Marcia. Before we take your questions, I\u2019d like to highlight a number of recognitions Erie Insurance has received since our last call. In June, A.M. Best affirmed the A plus superior rating of the property and casualty affiliates of Erie Insurance Group as well as the A excellent rating of Erie Family Life Insurance Company. Erie property and casualty affiliates have maintained an A.M. Best rating of A excellent or better since 1939. Erie was again named to the Fortune 500 list of the largest American companies based on total revenue. And in July, Ward Group recognized Erie as one of the 50 top performing property and casualty companies. This is our seventh consecutive year receiving this award. Erie is only one of seven organizations to be named on both Ward\u2019s 50 top performing life health companies. JD power released its 2014 U.S. auto insurance study and Erie continued to be ranked in the high satisfaction tier for the two geographic territories we serve, the Mid-Atlantic and North Central regions. Our scores improved on price, billing, and payment. While these recognitions like these are nice, the real recognition comes from our loyal customer base who entrust us with what matters most to them. Seeing the continued growth in our customer base every year is the best recognition of all. And now, I\u2019ll turn call over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ron Bobman of Capital Returns. Your line is now open. Ron D. Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns Management LLC : Hi, good morning. Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Good morning. Ron D. Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns Management LLC : This is principally directed at Terry. The stock price for Erie Indemnity basically hasn\u2019t really gone anywhere since early 2011. When are management\u2019s actions or management\u2019s intentions going to shift for the benefit of shareholders? Or when will your efforts be reflected in the stock price, if it\u2019s your opinion, it\u2019s not yet? Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Well, I can never judge how the external parties view the performance and economics of the organization. I always have in my perspective and in my actions the thoughts of all the constituencies, shareholders, again, agents, customers, and employees. And so to me, it\u2019s a balancing act that requires some thoughtful strategy, as well as effective execution. I think, again, as evidenced by our performance and evidenced by the way our agents are performing and how loyal they are to us in terms of the loyalty we have with our customers, I think we\u2019re running an effective business and I\u2019ll leave it up to others to determine what the economics should be for that. Ron D. Bobman \u2013 Capital Returns Management LLC : But what are you \u2013 I mean the company\u2019s gotten commended by awards. as you highlighted, it\u2019s gotten commended by Best, as you highlighted, which are sort of basically, policyholder and sort of size-oriented and service-oriented commendations. So the company\u2019s being sort of applauded for its high marks in those sorts of constituents services. But as relates to shareholders, what are you doing or what are you going to begin doing that\u2019s going to begin to reward shareholders? Because what\u2019s transpired, I mean listen, the stock market\u2019s the score board and the company\u2019s not being and shareholders are not being rewarded, or at least not being recognized, for shareholder efforts that you\u2019re pursuing to date or at least for the last three years. So what comes to mind or what are you pursuing or what do you propose changing in your pursuit and your efforts to get sort of the commendation that shareholders desire that you\u2019re getting elsewhere for the other constituents. And that\u2019s it from me. Thanks a lot. Terrence W. Cavanaugh: One, again, I think is running an effective business. And I think over the \u2013 again, we look at it over the long period of time so I guess if I look a bit in the rear view, I think we have rewarded shareholders both in terms of, again, capital appreciation and the dividends that have been paid over the years. And as, obviously, always difficult to predict the future both in terms of operating results, how those compare to others in the industry, and how that would be recognized by those that wish to invest their capital in the property casualty space. So I guess I spend my time trying to run the best business I can, again, for those constituencies I mentioned, and I think over the long haul, if we do that effectively, our results will be rewarded as relates to others in the property casualty space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber if William Blair. Your line is now open. Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks. The margin\u2019s beginning to come up. Do you think there\u2019s room for it to continue to rise and what\u2019s going to drive that rise if you think there is further room? Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Again I think it\u2019s difficult to predict always the future. I think we\u2019ve obviously, started off with a strong year. We are cognizant of the need to continue to run an effective organization. Obviously, margins are based upon the top line in terms of again how we continue to drive the top line and then manage the effective investments of the business to manage our cost side. And so I would hope that, it\u2019s going to continue as I talked about. The way our business runs, it\u2019s a lumpy, not a linear cost structure for us. And so therefore there will be inevitably need to invest in the business in certain quarters going forward that might cause some margin compression. But I think, again, we recognize the need to continue to run an effective business that produces margins. Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Excluding commissions and excluding investments, what do you think your core growth rate of expenses is? Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Outside of commissions and investments \u2013 and my investments\u2026 Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Like investing in systems or special projects (indiscernible) as you just mentioned. Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Again, it\u2019s sort of lumpy there. Obviously, any number of things that can cause that go up and down in terms of agency \u2013 variable compensation on the agency side, incentive plans, staffing requirements. And so, you know, we would like to, again, run an effective business. We would want to be able to have margins continue to increase, and have the business run effectively. But I guess I\u2019m not necessarily going to bifurcate the business and make a comment on that right now. I would be more than happy to think about and get back to you. Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. As far as the auto insurance segment, could you comment on the competitive landscape? Have you see an increase in competition in the last six months, through the first half of 2014? Or would you say the competitive level is relatively stable with 2013? Terrence W. Cavanaugh: Again, it varies by territory. I guess if you ask me one way, I would say it\u2019s a little bit more competitive. I think people are, based upon what\u2019s happened on the property side, maybe again, redirecting and refocusing on the automobile side. There\u2019s obviously no lack of competitors in that space. So I would suggest that there\u2019s maybe a little bit more competition around the auto product line than there was a year ago. Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then as far as frequency in auto, we\u2019ve seen some good results at some other carriers. How\u2019s your frequency running in the last three to six months? Terrence W. Cavanaugh: It is up, primarily based upon we had a significant weather activity that really hit our auto line very, very hard. And so we \u2013 it actually is one of our larger auto events by virtue of this weather that came through central Pennsylvania. And so it had a tendency to drive that up significantly where we had it significantly \u2013 it also increased severity because there\u2019s a lot of totals that came through the hail damage in that storm. Outside of that, our numbers are looking okay both in terms of frequency and severity. Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then as far as home owners, I mean for the last couple years, a lot of the industry has pulled back, has been really restructuring their home owner\u2019s books of business. Is that still going on, or is competition beginning to seep back in that market? Terrence W. Cavanaugh: I think there\u2019s some more competition. I think, again, the industry had a good year last year and, therefore, I think memories have a tendency to fade a little bit in terms of again what can happen on your property book of business. I think there\u2019s also a belief that the industry\u2019s getting smarter in terms of its predictive modeling and what is a good property risk versus a less than good property risk. And so I think the competition is smarter, stronger. I think there\u2019s more thoughtful approach to, again, what other lines of business they can sell around the home owner line and we\u2019re trying to do the same thing. And so, again, it\u2019s a business that is a significant opportunity for the industry if people can figure out how to price it properly and how to underwrite it effectively.

As we typically do, we'll start the call today with the openings remarks from Terry and Marcia, and then we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the Company\u2019s current views about future events.

As you can see in our earnings release we continue to achieve solid results in the third quarter. We generated net income per share of $0.90 in the third quarter which was up $0.03 from the prior year. For the year net income per share was up $0.30 to $2.71. This year-over-year improvement reflects strong growth in management margin, as well as our investment operations. For the Exchange, direct written premium continues to outpace Koning's 2014 industry projection of 4.5%, increasing almost 9% for the third quarter and 8.5% for the year. We are very pleased with this growth in direct written premium resulting from increases in both policies in force and average premium per policy, along with a strong retention rate of 90.5%. When we talk about strong quarterly results like these, it\u2019s important to remember that these results weren\u2019t the outcome of some near-term action rather the seeds to these results were planted quarters if not years ago and took careful attention to be realized. We also know that the road to success is paid with loyal agents, strong customer retention and providing products that consumers want and need. Therefore, we will continue to focus our investments on these interwoven priorities, helping our agents to be successful, finding new ways to provide exceptional service and delivering products that customers need in a manner in which they want. It should come as no surprise to those of you who have followed Erie for some time that it all starts with attracting and retaining a loyal agency force. Without question, our agents are crucial to the sustained success of our Company as they are the face of Erie in the communities we serve. One way we are supporting our agents and helping them be successful is by investing in targeted marketing initiatives to increase brand awareness and the places they call home. And our efforts are working. According to our recent J.D. Power study Erie\u2019s brand awareness has increased 25% over the past three years, thanks impart for our Go Local marketing initiative. We are also laying the ground work for their success through technology and ongoing platform enhancements. We have had great success over the past few years with a rollout of our personalized web-based coding system, and enhancements to our commercial system and our life system. :  With that I will now ask Marcia to provide you with more details on our financial performance. Marcia Dall :  Thank you Terry and good morning everyone. As Terry mentioned net income for Erie Indemnity was $0.90 per diluted share in the current quarter compared to $0.87 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, reflecting increased revenue from management operation. In our management operations income before taxes was $62 million up $2 million or 1% over the prior year quarter. Revenue from our management operations grew $29 million to $370 million, this represents an 8.5% increase over the prior year period and is consistent with the nearly 9% increase in direct written premium of the property and casualty group. Cost of management operations grew $27 million or 10% to $308 million. Commission expense grew $21 million or 11.5%. Commission growth outpaced direct written premium growth primarily due to a projected increase from agent incentive cost. Non-commission expenses increased $6 million or 7% over the prior year quarter. The increase in expenses is attributable to increased cost associated with technology, underwriting and policy processing cost. These increases were partially offset by decreased pension cost and a decrease in the employee incentive plan cost related to underwriting performance.  Income from investment operations decreased 23% to $8 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $10 million in the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to a decrease in limited partnership income. We are pleased with our results for the first nine months of 2014. Indemnity\u2019s net income on a year-to-date basis is up $15 million to $142 million. On a per share basis, net income is up $0.30 per share to $2.71. In our management operations income before taxes grew $20 million over 11% to $188 million. The gross margin from management operations for the first nine months of 2014 was 17.5% compared to 17.1% for 2013. Revenue from our management operations grew $82 million to $1.1 billion an increase of more than 8% reflecting strong growth in property and casualty premium. For the year premium per policy grew 4%, in addition on strong policyholder retention and the increase in new policies resulted in policy growth of 4.5%. Cost of management operations grew $62 million to $882 million up 7.7%. Commission expense grew $49 million to $587 million. Similar to the quarter Commission growth was higher than direct written premium growth in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to an increase in agent incentive cost. Non-commission expenses increased $30 million up 4.5% over the prior year period. Our non-commission expenses for the first nine months of the year benefited from a decrease in employee incentive plan cost and pension cost. Indemnity\u2019s income from investment operations grew $1 million to $26 million for the first nine months of 2014. And our continued commitment to provide shareholder value we paid dividends to shareholders of $89 million for the first nine months of 2014.  Now I will turn the call back over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh :  Thank you, Marcia. Now before we take your questions I am really proud to announce two industry recognitions we recently received. In August Erie was once again recognized by J.D. Power & Associates receiving the top ranking for highest and customer satisfaction with small business commercial insurance. Eire Indemnity was also named in the Barron\u2019s 400 Index which collects the most fundamentally sound and attractively priced stock from all corners of the market. Only 6% of the publically traded companies are included on that list affirming the strength of our capital management strategy. Finally I want to give you a quick update on our expansion into the Kentucky market. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we expect to begin writing personal auto, home insurance, personal excess, life annuity products in Kentucky in the fourth quarter of 2014.  And now I will turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for your question. Question: and: Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And I am not showing any questions at this time. Terry Cavanaugh :  Alright, if there will be no questions. I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest this morning. As we approach the end of 2014 and look ahead, I believe we are well positioned for continued long-term growth and value creation. Thanks in large part on our unwavering commitment to exceeding the expectations of our customer. Thank you. Scott Beilharz :  Thanks again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our Web site erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 P.M. Eastern Time today. If you have any questions, please call me at area code (814)-870-7312. Thank you.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning. Today I'm going to give you a brief overview of our results for 2014 and then update you on the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. Marcia then will take you through a more detailed view of our financial results. Indemnity's net income per share increased from $3.08 to $3.18 in 2014. Our commitment to being above and on service and our dedication to our agents and customers' satisfaction has not wavered over the decades and is what enables us to continue to have consistent earnings growth. Our management operations income before taxes increased 6.5% for the year reflecting a strong top-line growth. This increase was partially offset by higher agent compensation based on profitable growth and ongoing technology investments to position us for the future. Indemnity's top-line growth was fueled by nearly 9% increase in direct written premium from the property and casualty group. This growth outpaced Koning's annual industry projection of 4.6% and we believe we will mark the third year in a row of growth that is more than three points higher than the industry. Before I ask Marcia to walk you through the financial results; let me first provide you with a brief update on the progress we made in 2014 on our strategic initiatives to expand our product offerings and increase our footprint, enhance the customer and agent experience and remain above all in service. We continue to proactively explore ways to incorporate new technology and innovative ideas. For example, our web based technology, DSpro allows our agents to complete in auto, home, [board] [ph], PCL and term life quote in less than five minutes. Looking at the future, we are evaluating game changing technology like drones that can be employed in areas such as claims and loss control. We continue to expand our product lines by giving our agents more choices for their customers. In the fourth quarter, we initiated ridesharing coverage for drivers of companies like Uber and Lyft to fill in the coverage gaps associated with this type of exposure. In our commercial lines we introduced the custom collection suite of products and services that offer protection and risk management tailor-made for targeted class of business owners. We started with our restaurant program and plan to offer similar comprehensive protection to other business classes over the next few years. In December, we launched two new innovative universal life products; ErieSecure Life and ErieSecure Life Plus. They combine the best features of both universal and whole life products such as cash accumulation, guaranteed benefits and flexible premiums. These products provide us with another avenue to grow and compete directly with the whole life products that have been leading the industry over the past few years. We also took an important step forward in expanding our geographic footprint in 2014 with the addition of Kentucky. We introduced auto, home and life products and plan to offer commercial lines in early 2016. The Kentucky market has been very receptive of our agents and our brand and we are very pleased with our success today. We raised the bar for enhanced agent and customer experience with the completion of our technical learning center. With the doors opened in January of this year, we unveiled a state-of-the-art hands-on claims training facility. This is a key part of our proactive approach to the claims process. It will benefit our loss control representatives and claims adjusters among others making them better equipped to evaluate risks, assess losses and settle claims. In an era where nearly every insured has superior service, our industry-leading technical learning center is a concrete example of our continued investment and commitment to remain above all in service. At this point, I will ask Marcia to walk you through our financial results. Marcia Dall : Thank you, Terry, and good morning everyone. As we finalized the reporting for 2014 we decided to simplify our press release for our investors so that it would be easier to see the results and key highlights for the fourth quarter and the total year. In my commentary today, I'm going to provide additional context on these results. On a full-year basis, 2014 was another very good year. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis increased $0.10 per share to $3.18. We delivered strong top-line growth and growth in management operating income. However, our net income grew at a slower pace as a result of lower earnings from our alternative investment portfolio. Indemnities top-line growth of 8.5% was driven by nearly 9% growth in the direct premium of the property and casualty group. Direct written premium benefited from both solid increases and policies enforced and average premium per policy on all of our major product lines. Our agents and employees help us maintain an outstanding retention rate of over 90%. This is a reflection of our strong brand and above all service philosophy even in an ever-increasing competitive environment. At the end of 2014, we had nearly 2,200 highly loyal independent agencies with over 11,000 producers across our footprint. Our management operating income grew 6.5% in 2014 to $223 million based on strong top-line growth that was partially offset by higher agent compensation from profitable growth and ongoing strategic technology investments. Although, we began the year with significant weather related events including a May hailstorm that increased the property and casualty group combined ratios significantly. We ended the year at a statutory combined ratio of 100.6%. We had an exceptionally low combined ratio in the fourth quarter based on improved current accident year trends from lower frequency and severity. No major weather-related events and reserve releases from the settlement of a number of more significant claims. As a result of the lower combined ratio, the profitability bonus for our agents increased in the fourth quarter resulting in agent compensation for the year growing at a slightly higher pace than our top-line growth. Our non-commission expenses grew 6% overall in 2014. More than two points lower than our top-line growth rate of 8.5%. While we continue to manage expenses diligently and prioritize spending, our top-line growth drives our underwriting, policy processing and customer service variable expenses. Our investment income was down in 2014 based on the decline in our alternative investment portfolio earnings most of which was reflected in our fourth quarter earnings. We made a strategic decision almost 10 years ago to discontinue additional investment commitments in this asset class for Indemnity. As this portfolio continues to run-off, we expect to see more limited and inconsistent earnings from this part of our investment portfolio based on the nature of this asset class. Regarding the fourth quarter, our management operating earnings were down significantly from the prior period due to three primary factors. First, as I mentioned before, we ended the year with a significantly lower combined ratio than we expected at the end of third quarter. So we incurred additional commission related expense based on a higher agent profitability and bonus payout. Second, the lower combined ratio resulted in a higher annual incentive payout for our employees, which was also reported in the fourth quarter. And finally due to the 20% growth in the indemnity stock price during the fourth quarter we incurred an additional expense related to both our long-term incentive plan and the directors deferred compensation plan, which includes a component based on the Indemnity's share price. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to focus on effectively managing our capital. Dividends paid to shareholders held almost $119 million during 2014. Furthermore in December, our Board approved a 7.2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend of a Class A and Class B shares for 2015. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Marcia. Looking back on 2014, we had a very successful year. Now in 2015, we look forward to another successful year as we celebrate our 90th anniversary a significant milestone for our company. Our theme for the 90th anniversary is above all together. Our year-long celebration will give us time to thank our agents, our customers, our employees, our retirees and all those who came before us for their support and contributions over nine decades. We recognize that our success comes from an unwavering focus on our agents and customer satisfaction and a continued investment in our employees, technology and products. This strategy allows us to continue to be well-positioned for long-term growth in revenue and earnings. Now, I'd be happy to take your questions, so I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open up the line. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Adam Klauber : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Couple of different questions, so if you exclude some of the incentive comp with the margin from management operations being in line with fourth quarter last year, better or worse? Marcia Dall : So when you look at our annual incentive comp for the year for 2014, it was actually lower in total than the - what we paid down in 2013. Adam Klauber : Right. But in the fourth quarter you had again commissions were higher - I'm asking more in the fourth quarter not for 2014. Marcia Dall : So your question again was fourth quarter expenses for this year excluding -- Adam Klauber : Right. If you look at \u2013 Marcia Dall : Incentive comp what occurred, right? Adam Klauber : Right. And the higher commissions, yes. Terry Cavanaugh : Yes. According to variable compensation that was utilized in terms of the improving loss ratio for our agents and then the incentive comp, I'm looking at the numbers now I would suggest that it was pretty similar in terms of flat from last year. Adam Klauber : Okay, okay. So I know you don't give forecast. I'm not asking for specifically, but as we think about that - the margin for the management operations, should we think about being stable for next year or there potential for improvement? Terry Cavanaugh : Again, our business is a bit unique in terms of again how we play-off each other in terms of the exchange and the Indemnity company. And as you saw in the fourth quarter based upon the success of the exchange there was some additional costs associated with Indemnity. We are very focused on making sure the exchange as a vehicle for our agents and customers success is always well-managed and is again, we invest in that very effectively. So we believe that again over the long-term, we can continue to grow the top-line as well as we will grow earnings. I'm not going to suggest that in any one quarter or in a year that will be linear. Adam Klauber : Okay, okay. And then as far as top-line, in general it seems P&C industry is getting more competitive. Are you seeing that in your business? Terry Cavanaugh : I would say as a general statement, yes. So when we say more competitive I think, again, after a series of years there are more of our competitors are anxious to hold onto their book of business. I think they may be a little reluctant to raise prices to do that. But I'm very bullish in our ability to be able to grow our business. I think again, as you see we have a significant advantage with our agency force. I think again, we've had a good model in terms of the product and prices what we have. I think again, we can continue to grow our geography as well as expanding geography. And I think, we will continue to look for opportunities to price effectively. I do believe there's still opportunity especially in the auto line or the homeowners line and I'll call it the commercial property lines. And we're beginning to see some signs of exposure growth both personal and commercial. Adam Klauber : Okay, okay. That's good to see. In auto specifically, have you seen more recently any pick up in frequency compared to six months ago? Terry Cavanaugh : From six months ago? Adam Klauber : Whatever from 6, 12 months ago is frequency higher today? Terry Cavanaugh : No. Not really. Obviously, I think there is some of their statistics would indicate there is more mileage being put on automobiles but they are safer. The general population that we have as a customer seems to be doing a good job, so I would say our frequency is not growing. Adam Klauber : Okay, okay. Thank you though that's my questions. Thank you very much. Terry Cavanaugh : Thanks Adam. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Terry Cavanaugh for any further remarks. A - Terry Cavanaugh : Well, thank you very much. We appreciate you dialing in and we look forward to the continuing dialogue in 2015. Scott Beilharz : Thanks again for joining us. I'm sorry, go ahead Danielle. Operator : No. Go ahead. Scott Beilharz : Okay. A recording of this call we posted on website erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today.

Today, I\u2019ll talk about our first quarter results. Marcia will then go over the financials and I\u2019ll finish with some recent recognition we received. We will then take your questions. As you saw on our press release, our net income of $0.74 per share was down from $0.88 last year. Our results were primarily driven by the following four factors : Strong management fee revenue growth, higher agent incentives, technology expenses, and lower income from limited partnership investments. I will touch upon the first three and then Marcia will provide more details on the financials. Let me begin with revenue growth. In the first quarter of 2015, we saw an increase in the direct written premium for the property and casualty group of 7.7% compared to last year. We achieved a significant milestone in the first quarter of 2015. We now have over 5 million policies in force. And the average premium from our 2,200 agencies has grown to over $2.5 million. Let me highlight two areas that are helping drive this growth. First enhancing the agent and customer experience is a critical component of growth and we\u2019re continuing to make it a priority whether we are supporting our agents with their presence in the digital marketplace or helping our customers by providing better access to their policies, bills and ID cards. We are making it easier for our agents and customers to do business with us. Second, over the long-term, we view our geographic expansion strategy as another avenue for growth. Late last year, we added Kentucky to our footprint. With personal lines and life up and running, we are encouraged by the early results and are on track to rollout commercial lines in early 2016. From a cost perspective, there were two primary drivers that caused our expense growth to be higher than our revenue growth : Agent incentive costs and our investment in technology. It is important to keep in mind agent compensation represents two-thirds of our operating expenses. The most significant piece is the base commission, which tracks with direct written premium growth. The next largest portion is the agent incentives related to profitable growth. Obviously weather, mix of business, and agency overall performance are all contributors, and can vary quarter-to-quarter causing variability in agent incentives related to profitability. In the first quarter of 2015, we accrued higher projected agent incentive costs than one year ago because there was less severe weather related to loses experienced by the property and casualty group compared to the same timeframe last year. The second biggest driver of expense growth relates to technology enablement. As you know, we\u2019ve consciously been investing in technology that makes it easier for our agents to do business with us and technology that makes it easier for our customers to interact with us. Our technology related expenses for the quarter were $5 million higher than the first quarter of 2014, which reflects incremental investments directly related to this strategy. An example of this strategy is our focus on development of a mobile application that can be accessed on a smartphone, tablet or traditional PC. One of these applications that has been developed is a new business quoting app that significantly improves our real time agent lead generation capability. This capability will be employed within the year. A second example is the technology investment we made to implement our enhanced motorcycle product on our personal lines web quote, bind and issue platform. This product rolled out in early March in Kentucky and will be offered more broadly in the months to come. Finally in personal lines, we continue to enhance our personal lines web quote, bind and issue platform with an automated underwriting review tool that increases the speed, quality, and consistency of the underwriting process. We remain committed to proved investment in technology that provides value to our agents and customers and supports our long-term success. I will now ask Marcia to elaborate on our first quarter. Marcia? Marcia Dall : Thank you, Terry, and good morning everyone. As Terry mentioned, our earnings per share on a diluted basis decreased $0.14 per share to $0.74 in the first quarter, compared to the same period last year. While we continue to deliver strong top line growth, net income decreased due to a reduction in management operating pre-tax income and lower earnings from our alternative investment portfolio. Management operating pre-tax income decreased 10% for the quarter to $53 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. Revenue from management operations grew $25 million to $351million in the first quarter. Indemnities top-line growth of 7.5% was driven by 7.7% growth in the direct written premium of the Property and Casualty Group. Direct written premium benefited from both solid increases and policies in force and average premium per policy on all of our major product lines. Furthermore, we saw consistent growth in both personal lines and commercial lines with personal lines growing 6.6% and commercial lines growing 10.1%. Indemnities strong top line growth was offset by higher agent compensation and ongoing strategic technology investments. Commission expenses increased $20 million, or 11.2% in the first quarter, compared to last year. This increase resulted from based commission growth, consistent with our growth in direct written premium, and also an increase in projected agent incentive costs related to underwriting profitability for the Property and Casualty Group. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2014 saw significant weather related events resulting in a statutory combined ratio for the Property and Casualty Group of 108%. Our first quarter 2015 combined ratio of a 103% was significantly lower than the first quarter of last year due to improved current accident year trends and no major weather-related events. Therefore, the projected profitability based agent bonuses where higher compared to the prior year quarter. Non-commission expenses increased $10 million, or 11.7% in first quarter, compared to last year. As Terry mentioned, the biggest driver here relates to our investment in technology. Technology cost increased $5 million, which included $3 million to consulting and contract labor, and $1 million each of cost related to employees, and hardware and software. As Terry mentioned, this necessary investment in technology allows us to remain competitive and positions us for future profitable growth. Indemnity\u2019s investment income of $6 million in the first quarter of this year is down from $11 million in the first quarter of 2014. The primary driver of this decrease is a decline in our alternative investment portfolio earnings, as expected, based on the continued runoff of this portfolio. Finally, we paid $31.7 million in dividends to our shareholders in the first quarter of 2015. Now I\u2019ll turn call the back over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Marcia. We understand that you, as investors, may not be pleased with our quarter-over-quarter drop in earnings. Our business model can result in variability of earnings quarter-to-quarter. However, we remain committed to creating shareholder value for the year and over the long-term. Last month we held our annual shareholder meeting. I\u2019m pleased to announce that all 12 members of our Board of Directors were elected to serve another year. I would like to thank our directors for their continued guidance and commitment to Erie and thank our shareholders for their continued support. And now I\u2019d like to highlight our recent recognitions. February results of the 2015 J.D. Power Property Claim Satisfaction study, which measures customer satisfaction across the Property Claims experience was released. I\u2019m proud to report that Erie continues to rank in the high satisfaction tier. In March, Erie was listed among four of the Americas\u2019 best employers list, we were ranked 72nd on the list of 500, and fourth out of 25 insurance companies ranked. And just this week, it was announced that Erie earned first place in the J.D. Power Insurance Shopping Study for the third time in a row, and the six times since 2007. We continue to score high in all three of the shopping study factors : Price, distribution channel and policy offerings. The high standards and dedication of our agents and employees to deliver the best possible product and to be above all in service is acknowledged, with every recognition we receive. Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Terry Cavanaugh : Again, we thank you for your participation. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Scott Beilharz : Thanks again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today. If you have any questions please call me at area code 814-870-7312. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Scott Beilharz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Ashley, and welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's discussion about the second quarter 2015 results. Joining me today are Terry Cavanaugh, President and Chief Executive Officer; Marcia Dall, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean McLaughlin, Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. As we typically do, we\u2019ll start the call today with opening remarks from Terry and Marcia and then we will open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company\u2019s current views about future events.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter results I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of two members of our Erie family; John Peterson and Susan Hirt Hagen. John Peterson passed away on May 30th of this year. John joined Erie in 1962 as the company's first Investment Officer and then went on to serve as Chief Financial Officer and eventually President and CEO, After retiring in 1995 remained with Erie serving on the Board of Directors until 2003. John will be fondly remembered here at Erie for his personal generosity as well as his contribution to the financial growth of the company during his tenure. Erie suffered another profound loss with the passing of Susan Hirt Hagen on June 15th. Susan was the daughter of our cofounder H.O. Hirt and the co-trustee of the H.O. Hirt Trust. She was also the first female and longest-serving Board Member of Erie Indemnity Company. Susan gave tirelessly to the Erie. Furthermore her generosity of time and talent stretched far beyond our walls. She touched many across the country and she served in leadership positions on a number of boards of local, state and national nonprofit organizations over the years. Susan is best remembered here at Erie for her conviction, compassion and intellect that helps form the very fabric of the Erie culture. She will be fondly remembered and sadly missed by all of us. Earlier this month Jonathan Hirt Hagen was appointed to succeed his mother as co-trustee of the H.O. Hirt Trust. Jon joins his cousin Elizabeth Hirt Vorsheck and Sentinel Trust Company as co-trustee. As you have seen from our second quarter financial release yesterday, Erie Indemnity had a solid quarter with strong top line growth, a modest increase in our management margin dollars and additional earnings from our alternate asset portfolio. As a result we reported net income per share increasing from $0.94 last year to $1.07 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our top line growth was driven by 7.6% increase in direct written premiums from the exchange. We are pleased with this growth in light of accounting's forecast of 3.8% for the industry this year. Our ability to outpace the industry growth speaks to both the strength of our brand and the commitment to the -- and excellence of our agents and employees. Regarding our strategic initiatives we introduced three new product enhancements in the second quarter of this year that will improve the customer and agent experience. First our improved motorcycle coverage rolled out in Pennsylvania. This is a strong product by virtue of its significantly enhanced pricing, optional first party medical coverage and new safety equipment and accessory coverage. This enhanced motorcycle product will allow our agents to better compete with the national and specialty carriers. We will continue to roll out this product in additional states within our footprint later this year. Second in Commercial Lines we continue to target specific business classes with what we call our Custom Collections portfolio. As you may recall we initially offered this suite of enhanced products to restaurant business owners. Since the beginning of this year the number of new restaurant policies has already surpassed the total number of new policies in all of 2014. In the second quarter we expanded our Custom Collection to include wholesalers and distributors. The expansion to the auto services class and veterinarian pet care classes are on track for rollout later this year. And third, Erie Family Life expanded its whole Life portfolio by rolling out a new juvenile whole life product that provides simple and affordable coverage. We remain committed to investing in technology to ensure we can offer the best customer and agent experience possible. As an example we recently rolled out our enhanced online auto quote. This new streamlined mobile friendly capability will meet the digital demands of our customers while improving the overall agent experience for responding to an online quote. I will now ask Marcia to expand on our financial results. Marcia. Marcia Dall : Thanks, Terry. As Terry said we had a solid second quarter with net income per share on a diluted basis increasing $0.13 per share to $1.07 in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. We continue to generate some growth in our just written premiums from the Property and Casualty Group which resulted in a 7.4% growth in our revenue from management operations. Our agents helped drive solid increases in both policies in force and average premium per policy on all of our major product lines. We saw policy growth of 4% in both personal lines and commercial lines and our overall average premium per policy grew nearly 4% as well. As Terry said our abilities outpaced the industry growth speaks to both the strength of our brand and the commitment to excellence of our agents and employees. Our focus on enhancing our products and the investments we've made in technology to make it easier to do business are also helping to support our growth for the long-term. Commission expenses increased $19 million, or 9% in the second quarter compared to last year, driven primarily by the increase in just written premiums and the increase in estimated agent incentive costs related to profitable growth. Similar to the first quarter, our statutory combined ratio for the Property and Casualty Group continue to be significantly better in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year. The Property and Casualty Groups did not have any major weather-related events in the quarter and has had some favorable developments from prior accident year claims. As you may recall a large scale event in May of last year caused this combined ratio to escalate in the second quarter of 2014. Therefore our estimates for the profitability-based agent incentive payout were higher in this quarter than last year's second quarter. Non-commission expenses increased $7 million or 7% in the second quarter compared to last year. Investments in technology, expenses related to our employee pension plans resulting from the continued low interest rate environment and higher projected employee incentive payout based on the current projected levels of profitable growth for the year were the primary drivers of this increase. Indemnity's income from investment operations was $16 million compared to $7 million last year as a result of an increase in one of our private equity limited partnership investments this quarter. Please keep in mind limited partnership earnings tend to be cyclical in nature and difficult to project. Finally our strong cash flow has enabled Indemnity to pay $32 million in dividends to our shareholders in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 7.2% increase over 2014. I will now turn the call back over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you Marcia. Before we take your questions, I am pleased to announce the recognitions we received since our last call. In June, A.M. Best affirmed the A+ superior rating for the Property and Casualty companies. We've enjoyed a rating of A excellent or better since 1939. Furthermore A.M. Best affirmed the A excellent rating for Erie Family Life. Last month JD Power released the results of the 2015 auto insurance study and Erie received the highest customer satisfaction ranking for the Mid-Atlantic region. We also continue to be ranked in the high satisfaction tier in the North Central region. Our increase in overall satisfaction was driven by improvements in policy offerings, interaction, price and claims. Finally the recognition that makes us especially proud is the great rating we received on the Great Places To Work study. This rating is calculated from survey feedback from our employees and highlights what makes their workplace culture great, in areas like professional development and training, company atmosphere, benefits and rewards. While all these recognitions are fantastic we recognize that the true value of all recognitions is to serve as a constant reminder of how important it is for us to be above all in service. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We do have a question from Charlie Smith of Fort Pitt Capital. Your line is open. Charlie Smith : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wonder if the company has any broad thoughts with regard to both the threats and the opportunities that go with automated vehicles and cyber security of vehicles that we have been reading about a lot in the press over the past few weeks? Terry Cavanaugh : Charlie, we are actively researching the evolving technology in the automobile space as well as quite frankly the homeowner space and the building space. We are on -- we are seeing some interesting opportunities in that area as well as the share in the economy et cetera. So I think it's early days to just to wrap our arms around what exactly that will present to us in terms of opportunity from an insurance standpoint as well as any ultimate threat. I think the cyber piece of it is again relatively new in terms of again what we are hearing about those issues. And so I can have you rest assured though that we have people both internally and we are working with external consultants to make sure that we stay on top of this issue. Charlie Smith : Okay. I would encourage you, when you do formulate sort of maybe a broad policy within the company, you produce some sort of a white paper that outlines that strategy. Terry Cavanaugh : I appreciate that feedback. I mean we are always balancing and obviously need to be a good partner with our customers, our agents and the community at the same time making sure that we have competitive capabilities that will serve all of us well. Charlie Smith : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Katelyn Young of William Blair. Your line is open. Katelyn Young : Thank you. I am in for Adam Klauber and sorry I joined a little late, sorry if you touched on these points. But just a few questions for you. Can you just give us a little bit more color on how the homeowners and commercial business is going? Specifically just looking at the homeowners growth, 7% for this year, sorry, this quarter or last quarter versus a little bit stronger in the last two years. Can you just tell us how that's escalated? Terry Cavanaugh : Specifically the homeowners line of business. Katelyn Young : Yes. Terry Cavanaugh : Yes. I think we have obviously -- if you have followed us and followed the industry I think there has been a pretty recognition to be able to have adequate rate and the rates have grown pretty dramatically in the homeowner line over the last several years certainly with us and within the industry. And I think we are now finding ourselves in a position of a better rate picture that is not requiring us to take as much aggressive rate action from that standpoint. So I think that's the primary driver to that. I am still very pleased with the growth number. I think we are seeing it again and we are also very pleased again with our strong retention number. Again I think with the combination of the two we saw a very good model. Katelyn Young : All right. And then what increases are you seeing in auto specifically? Terry Cavanaugh : Again it varies by state and actually by company and class of business. And so again we would say that low single-digits. Katelyn Young : And then loss experience in autos, any increase in frequency there or do you see any changes? Terry Cavanaugh : We are seeing a little bit. I think our numbers would indicate it. But again obviously miles driven are moving up. We are seeing -- there is some concern about distracted driving and things of that nature, nothing significant. We stay on top of it and we think we are in good shape from that standpoint. Katelyn Young : So even with miles up, is frequency following that or are you seeing something from that? Terry Cavanaugh : Yes. I would say that we are not seeing anything [anomaly] from that standpoint. The industry is seeing the same activity. Katelyn Young : Sure. Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I had. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I am not showing any further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Terry Cavanaugh for any further remarks. Terry Cavanaugh : Okay. Thank you. I would like to thank everyone for their time this morning. As we look ahead to the second half of the year on track with our strategic initiatives and I believe we are well positioned for continued long-term operating success. Thank you for your interest and have a great weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You can all disconnect. Every have a wonderful day.",

I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Scott Beilharz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Karen, and welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's discussion about the third quarter 2015 results. Joining me today are Terry Cavanaugh, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Gutting, Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Sean McLaughlin, Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Before we discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the departure of Marcia Dall. As Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for the past 6.5 years, Marcia was an integral part of our management team. I want to thank Marcia for her efforts and wish her well in the next phase of our carrier. Greg Gutting has assumed the position of Interim Chief Financial Officer. Greg steps into this role as a 30 year contributor to Erie\u2019s financial operations. Greg has served as the company\u2019s Senior Vice President and Controller for the past 6 years and I\u2019m gratified for the continuity and competency Greg brings to this Interim role.  After my comments, I\u2019ll ask Greg to discuss our third quarter and year to date results in more detail. Erie Indemnity recorded gains in net income in both the third quarter and year to date. Strong top line growth and positive limited partnership investment earnings were the primary drivers of the improved results. Net income for the quarter was $0.94 per diluted share, up from $0.90 per share in the third quarter of 2014. For the year, net income per diluted share is $2.75, compared to $2.71 last year. Our strong top line growth is primarily driven by the 7.6% increase in direct written premium for the property and casualty group for the first three quarters of 2015, compared to last quarter year. We continue to outpace Koning's industry forecast of 4% premium growth for 2015. Erie\u2019s agents and employees are essential to our continued strong financial performance and it\u2019s our job to ensure that they have the tools, training, and resources necessary to fulfill our promise of superior service. With that in mind we continue to execute on the strategic initiatives we laid on in 2014. One of our key strategic priorities is to refresh our claims experience, earlier this month we launched the initial release of our new claims system. This automated claims system will enhance our ability to deliver best-in-class claims service experience. It will reduce the time it takes to settle the claim and provide greater consistency, wherever Erie\u2019s claims service is delivered. Workers compensation was the first line of business deployed in this system. This platform will now be used to process all new and existing workers comp claims. Implementation of the remaining lines of business will be added incrementally, beginning with personal and commercial auto in 2016. We are also excited to be putting drones to use in the claims process. Erie insurance was among the first wave of insurance companies to get FAA approval to use drones. Just this month, we flew on for the first time to inspect storm damage to a residential roof in Pennsylvania. While the FAA works to determine proper guidelines in oversight for drones in public use, we will continue to explore their value as tools for more efficient customer service, risk assessment, and claims management. In addition to improving our processes we\u2019re also focused on giving our agents and customers the products they expect from Erie. First, we\u2019re pleased to announce that agents are no able to quote and write commercial products in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. With the recent rollout of commercial auto, we have completed the suite of business insurance products that also includes Ultrapack Plus, business commercial liability, and workers compensation coverages. We now offer the same high-quality customized commercial insurance products to business owners in Kentucky as the personal insurance products we provided there for the past year. In commercial lines, we expanded our custom collections clientele by adding veterinary and pet care businesses. We anticipate the same positive response from them as we\u2019ve seen from our other businesses already benefiting from our custom collection suite of products. Finally, in personal lines we\u2019ve made both wide sharing coverage and our enhanced motorcycle coverage available in more states throughout our footprint and we will continue to expand these product offerings geographically through the remaining remainder of 2015 and into 2016. With that I will ask Greg to expand on our third quarter and year-to-date financials. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thank you, Terry. As Terry mentioned Erie Indemnity\u2019s net income was $0.94 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $0.90 per share for the same period last year, reflecting an increase in income for management operations. Income from management operations before taxes was $68 million, up $6 million, or 11.8% over the prior year quarter. Our management margin for the quarter was 17.2% versus 16.5% in last year\u2019s third quarter. Revenue for management operations grew from $370 million in the third quarter of 2014 to $396 million in the current quarter. This $26 million or 7.3% increase over last year\u2019s quarter is consistent with the 7.5% increase in direct written premiums of the property casualty group. Cost for management operations grew $20 million to $328 million, which represents a 6.4% increase over the third quarter of last year. Commissions increased $15 million or 7.5% in the quarter driven by the 7.5% increase in direct written premiums of the Property Casualty Group. The non-commission expense increase of $5 million or 4.2% in the third quarter was driven primarily by medical and pension costs, as well as higher projected employee incentive payouts based on current projected levels of profitable growth for the year. These increased costs were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. Income from investment operations before taxes totaled $7 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $8 million in last year\u2019s quarter. For the year, Indemnity reported a modest uptick in net income of $3 million to $145 million. On a per share basis, net income is up $0.04 per diluted share to $2.75. Management operations income before taxes grew $3 million to $191 million. Revenue from management operations grew $79 million or 7.4% year-to-date in 2015, compared to the same period last year. Steady increases in both all season fours, and premiums for policy for all lines of business for the exchange help drive these positive results. Cost of management operations for the nine months ended 2015 grew $76 million or 8.6%. Commission expenses increased $54 million or 9.1% over the first three quarters of last year. The 7.6% increase in direct written premiums of the Property Casualty Group and projected increases in the agent incentive costs related to profitable growth where the primary drivers of the increased commission. Non-commission expenses increased $22 million to $317 million in the first nine months of the year, compared to the same time last year. The primary drivers of the 7.6% increase were employee incentive costs, pension and medial cost and professional fees. The gross margin for management operations for the first nine months of 2015 is 16.6% versus 17.5% in 2014. The margin decrease was driven primarily by increased estimated agent incentive costs. Indemnity\u2019s income from investment operations on a pre-tax basis totaled $29 million in the first nine months of 2015, representing $3 million increase, compared to last year. Earnings from limited partnership investments were the primary contributor.  Finally, in the first three quarters of 2015 we paid our shareholders\u2019 dividends in the amount of $95 million. Before I end my commentary, I\u2019d like to mention that we will be implementing some new accounting guidance in the fourth quarter. In February of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2015\u2013 02 Consolidation. This update changed the analysis to determine whether the reporting entities should consolidate certain type types of legal entities. In accordance with the new accounting guidance, Indemnity is not deemed to have a variable interest in the exchange as the fees paid for services provided to the exchange no longer represent a variable interest. The compensation received by Indemnity for services provided for acting as the Attorney-in-Fact for the subscribers at the exchange is commensurate with the level of effort required to perform these services. Under the previously issued accounting guidance, Indemnity was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the exchange and the exchange\u2019s financial position and operating results were consolidated with Indemnity. We plan to adopt the new guidance on a retrospective basis, effective with our form 10-K filing for the period ended December 31, 2015. So beginning next quarter, the exchanges results will no longer be consolidated with Indemnity. This will have a significant impact on the statements of operations, statements of financial position, and statements of cash flow given the size of the exchanges operations. It will not impact Indemnity\u2019s net income or shareholder equity. Now, I will turn the call back over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Greg. As you know, Erie is above all in service brand is the hallmark of our value proposition. It has earned the loyalty and trust of our customers, agents, and shareholders, and many accolades and awards. Recently Erie Indemnity was included in the Forbes 50 most trustworthy financial companies for 2015. Only 7% of the publicly traded financial companies considered for the list made the cut. It\u2019s the second year in a row that Erie has earned the spot on the list; and like last year Erie topped the ranking for mid-cap companies. We also received recognition from J.D. Power and Associates and are pleased to announced that Erie took the top honors in their small-business commercial insurance study for the third year in a row. Additionally, we scored in the top tier in their annual household insurance study taking top honors in renters insurance segment. These accolades affirm the fact that we are accomplishing our goals. Our employees and agents are engaged, focused and executing effectively and our customers are continuing to value the products and services they get from Erie. Our results reflect Erie\u2019s commitment to our proven business model and our long term success. To support our purposeful and thoughtful planning, I shared the news last week that I\u2019d be retiring at the end of 2016. The long window allows us time to transition leadership and continue to focus on our strategic priorities with minimal disruption. The Board of Directors is committed to working to select a successor by the end of the first quarter 2016. That will allow careful planning, collaboration and knowledge sharing throughout the remainder of the year. I am engaged and committed to continue the great work currently underway to ensure that Erie\u2019s family executes today and prepares for tomorrow. And now, we\u2019ll the open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Christopher Martin from Macquarie. Christopher Martin : Hi guys, congrats on the quarter. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you. Christopher Martin : And Terry, congratulations on your pending retirement. I thought if you guys could go through a little further on your actual succession plans for replacing Marcia and then yourself? Will this be an internal or external review or serve a combination? If you could just go into a little bit that would be great, thanks. Terry Cavanaugh : At the current plan, the Board is focused on finding my successor and they are working to do that with the lens towards the internal organization. They will then make that decision and then they will follow that up with working with that person to name a permanent CFO. Christopher Martin : Okay, great. And would you expect the searching for the future company to be sort of the way you guys have been running with a full stakeholder focused not necessarily a shareholder focus in the company. Terry Cavanaugh : I didn\u2019t quite understand the question. What? Christopher Martin : Sorry. As you\u2019ve had some comments in the calls and over the past few quarters I hear this people questioning whether or not management was looking out for shareholders? So the company's which has been running this, is looking at the stakeholder model and you\u2019ve guys have been rewarded for that one from J.D. Power and Associates in Forbes et cetera. Just wondering if you think there will be any sort of change to that or you would stay focused on what you\u2019ve had? Terry Cavanaugh : I can\u2019t make a forward-looking projection like that. I think again the culture and the 90 years of success we\u2019ve had as organization speaks for itself. I think again it\u2019s very important that any successful organization balance all constituencies and that they are all thought of is important and if you sail on one you\u2019re probably not going to be successful. So I think again our model in terms of focusing on our customers, our agents, our shareholders and our employees as well as the community has worked well and I would believe that the Board will continue to make sure that\u2019s a focus going forward. Christopher Martin : Great, thanks. That\u2019s all I have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Katelyn Young from William Blair. Katelyn Young : Hi, good morning, a few questions for you guys. First, can you comment on any auto presentations you've been seeing in the market. Terry Cavanaugh : I am not sure I can comment on the market, clearly you can listen to others. I think again we are seeing obviously more I call it activity, you hear about when we clearly see more miles being driven, there is a slow evolution of our customer base buying newer automobiles that are more expensive to fix. Medical cost continues to escalate and the repair costs are not necessarily going down although they are mitigated by some inflationary numbers. So I guess we are watching it, we are seeing an uptick, we are monitoring it and we are very vigilant to make sure that we stay ahead of the pricing game. Katelyn Young : Okay, thank you. And then on the policies in force [indiscernible] if you could clear on that? Terry Cavanaugh : Again, I am having trouble hearing you. Could you repeat that again? Katelyn Young : I\u2019m sorry, the policy in force growth rates just shy of 4%, it seems you\u2019ve pull back a bit in the third quarter, sorry for the background noise. Terry Cavanaugh : Yeah, again that is still a good number compared to the industry. Obviously as you get larger and have the number of in force that we have, it\u2019s still a significant number and [indiscernible] the absolute number is still very strong and we are managing it to make sure that we pick the right business and at the right price so that we have long term underwriting profitability in the exchange. And at the same time, we recognize that competition is getting more robust. Katelyn Young : Okay, great. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I see no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Terry Cavanaugh for closing remarks. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you. Thanks again for joining us this morning. We are confident that our financial results demonstrate they are working hard to remain well positioned for continued long term growth and value creation. Look forward to talking you next quarter. Scott Beilharz : Thanks again for joining us. As a reminder, a recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today. If you have any questions, please call me at Erie code 814-870-7312. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Scott Beilharz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Tamara, and welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's discussion about the 2015 fourth quarter and total year results. Joining me today are Terry Cavanaugh, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Gutting, Interim Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean McLaughlin, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Today I will provide a brief look at our 2015 results and update you on the progress we are making with our strategic initiatives. But first, I would like to acknowledge the recent departure of Rick Burt, Executive Vice President of Products. I would like to thank Rick for his contribution to Erie and wish him the best in the next phase of his career. Indemnity\u2019s earnings per share increased from $3.18 in 2014 to $3.33 in 2015. Net revenue from operations increased by nearly $10 million to $233 million. Direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, the primary driver of Indemnity\u2019s net revenue grew an impressive 7.3%.  We consistently outpaced the industry results and we handily beat [Koning's] [ph] current 2015 estimate of 4.3%. The growth we achieved in 2015 is a direct result of the business strategy we implemented two years ago.  In 2015, we introduced and enhanced many products. We opened a state-of-the-art technical learning center and we expanded our geographic reach. Additionally, our investment in technology culminated in new and better tools for our agents and allowed us to increase efficiency and create additional revenue opportunities for the exchange that benefits Indemnity. We built out key business platforms like DSpro Web with eSignature functionality that reduced the quote to buying time of policies substantially. The 94% adoption rate of eSignature demonstrates our continued efforts to improve ease of doing business with our agents. Our improved online auto quote is another example of the importance we placed on system upgrades. Once again, positive agent response to these successful tools demonstrate why investment in this area is vital. In 2015, we also met market needs by delivering new and enhanced products that provide valuable coverage for our customers at competitive prices. In personal lines our auto policy enhancements including ride sharing coverage targeted at changing environment that will manifest itself in additional revenue and customer loyalty. In our popular new motorcycle product introduced in five states in 2015 we will continue to rollout into four additional states this year.  Our custom collection suite of products continues to complement our commercial portfolio by targeting quality business segments. In addition to restaurants, wholesaler distributors, veterinarian and pet care and auto services, this line will broaden to include additional business classes, later this year, including professional offices, retail, and technology. Not only do we developed and offer new and enhanced products in 2015, but we brought the claims experience to a higher level, upping our promise of superior service.  Last year, we went live with claim center. Workers compensation was the first line of business deployed in this new automated claims platform and we look forward to adding personal and commercial auto later this year.  We also opened the technical learning center giving agents and employees an interactive classroom who wish to hone their skills. And we are now utilizing the learning center for our smart start program that puts a renewed emphasis on cultivating and training talent in our claims force.  In 2015, we added a fully dedicated CAT response team to our organization. Along with the use of new tools like Drones, we continue to enhance the claims experience.  Finally, during the fourth quarter, we introduced commercial line products into our newest state, Kentucky completing our product portfolio there. We exceeded revenue expectations in this state and I\u2019d like to congratulate and thank the entire Kentucky team. Our 2200 agents and 5000 employees continue to work with resolve to execute on our overall strategy and we are seeing strong results from their efforts.  As we started the New Year, we do so having gained market share in every state in our footprint creating over 5 million policies in force. We grew average premium per agency to $2.7 million. We provided better claims service for our customers and we strengthened the exchange\u2019s balance sheet.  2015, our 90th year of business was a very good year for us. Our employees and agents take great pride in being part of the team that creates customer satisfaction and shareholder value.  We recognize there are ongoing challenges facing our industry including economic uncertainty, emerging technologies, and an ever-evolving loss picture. We will face these challenges by continuing to offer contemporary products and exceptional services with the best employees and agency force in the industry. Now, I will ask Greg to discuss our financial results in more detail. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thank you, Terry. Before I discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, I want to remind everyone that we adopted the new consolidation guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board as evidenced by our Form 10-K filed yesterday. Under the new guidance, Indemnity is no longer deemed to have a variable interest in the exchange as the fees paid for services provided to the exchange no longer represent a variable interest.  The compensation received by Indemnity for services provided for acting as the attorney in fact for the exchange is commensurate with the level of effort required to perform these services. Under the previously issued accounting guidance, Indemnity was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the exchange and the exchange\u2019s financial position and operating results were consolidated with Indemnity.  Accordingly, the statements of operations, statements of financial position and statements of cash flow in our Form 10-K filed yesterday with the SEC reflect results for Indemnity only. I want to make it clear that our adoption of the new guidance and subsequent deconsolidation of the exchange and Indemnity\u2019s results does not impact Indemnity\u2019s net income or shareholder equity.  That said, 2015 results confirm that we had another good year. Net income grew $7 million to $175 million resulting in an increase in earnings per share on a diluted basis from $3.18 in 2014 to $3.33 in 2015. Our net income growth was driven by an increase in net revenues from operations and investment income.  Income from operations grew 4.3% to $233 million in 2015. Top-line growth of 7% was driven primarily by a 7.3% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. Increases in both policies in force and the average premium per policy for all major product lines contributed to this premium increase.  For the year, expenses increased 7.5% driven by an 8.3% increase in commissions. Higher agent incentive cost related to profitable growth was the major contributor to the increased commissions. Non-commission expense growth of 5.9% for the year was notably lower than the revenue growth of 7%. We are pleased that we are able to effectively manage these expenses and we will continue to prioritize spending. Investment income grew 18.6% or $5.3 million for the year, primarily due to higher earnings from our limited partnership investments. Although we had strong returns from this asset class in 2015, it is important to note that this portion of the portfolio is in run-off and we expect to see more limited and inconsistent earnings from this part of our investment portfolio based on the nature of the asset class.  With respect to the fourth quarter, earnings per diluted share totaled $0.57, compared to $0.48 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Revenue grew 5.7% and expenses grew 4.2% resulting in a gross margin from operations of 11.7% versus 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Revenues from investments increased $2 million from the quarter, compared to last year. This increase was driven primarily by income from operations \u2013 from limited partnerships.  Finally, we are pleased to report that in 2015, we returned $127 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend and in December, our Board of Directors once again approved a 7.2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividends for both Class A and Class B shares for 2016.  I will now turn the call back over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Greg. Our strong results were affirmed by the position we continue to enjoy as a Fortune-500 company and the four top honors we were awarded by J.D. Power and Associates in 2015.  We were honored to be named highest in the renters insurance segment of the Household Insurance Study, highest in customer satisfaction with the Auto Insurance Purchase Experience, highest among auto insurers in the Mid-Atlantic region in the Auto Insurance Study, and highest in customer satisfaction nationally in the Small Business Commercial Insurance Study.  We also ranked first among mid-cap financial institution in Forbes 50 most trustworthy financial companies for 2015. We are grateful that our business model and our culture are recognized by third parties. Their recognition is a strong indicator that we are on the right path.  Finally, as you recall, last October, I announced that I will retire at the end of 2016. Our Board of Directors is working diligently to identify my successor. As that process takes place, we\u2019ll remain focused continuing to execute on our well defined strategy and in creating value for the long-term.  Now we will open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Katelyn Young with William Blair. Your line is now open. Katelyn Young : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Terry Cavanaugh : Good morning. Katelyn Young : I am wondering if you could talk about some of the trends in the commercial lines, specifically, kind of written premiums and PIF growth for the quarter. Terry Cavanaugh : I\u2019 sorry, written premium, what was the other? Katelyn Young : And the PIF growth rates, for the commercial lines? Terry Cavanaugh : For just the fourth quarter? Katelyn Young : Yes, I mean, it looks like there has been a deceleration in the growth of those metrics in the quarter. Just trying to think about that going forward? Terry Cavanaugh : Yes, and Kate, the growth did slowdown in the fourth quarter. It is slower quarter than normal but year-over-year, obviously, it did grow less than the fourth quarter of 2014. We had \u2013 I think, less contest activity and we also are being more discriminate, I would suggest in terms of some of the opportunities we have. The commercial lines business is a business that you have to pay attention to in terms of risk selection and we want to make sure that we are making the right calls from that standpoint. I would also suggest that competition has gotten a little bit heavier across our footprint. More companies are operating \u2013 I think, in that space. The larger companies are kind of come down \u2013 I think it\u2019s an attractive marketplace. But we are holding our own. I think our growth rate was very attractive as it relates to other markets. We are comfortable we can continue to grow the business effectively and do so with underwriting profit and maintaining great agency relationships and customer relationships. Katelyn Young : Great. Thanks and then, thinking about some of the costs in the quarter. It sounds like there was an increase in the commission, sort of offset by management of non-commission expenses. Is that something that you see continuing for the next year in terms of being able to manage sort of the technology investment and what not in the company, with the revenue growth next year? Terry Cavanaugh : The commission growth was primarily driven by the variable compensation plans we have in place with our agents. So the more profitability they produce for us, the larger that number becomes. And so that is a good news story in terms of again, for the exchange, and it\u2019s a good news story in terms of the compensation that\u2019s available to our agents. And so, that\u2019s a formula that we think works and that won\u2019t be touched next year. In terms of the non-commission expenses, we are always trying to make sure that we manage those effectively. As I\u2019ve said in the past, the way we spend is a bit lumpy and it\u2019s not as straight-line. But what as you saw in the fourth quarter how we did a nice job in terms of managing that number in a slower growth quarter. And the management team here is very focused on making sure that we do that in 2016. Katelyn Young : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I am showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Scott Beilharz for any closing comments. Scott Beilharz : Thanks again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today. If you have any additional questions, please call me at 814-870-7312. Thanks again. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you for your interest and support Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone.  Last week, we held our annual meeting of shareholders and wrapped up our 90th anniversary year. As I noted in the meeting, it was truly a complete year for Erie. The collaborative work and strong execution of our Erie employees and agents in 2015 resulted in financial and operational success across the organization. As we entered 2016, we continued to build on that success, producing strong profitable growth. Net income was $46 million or $0.87 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $39 million or $0.74 per share in the first quarter of 2015. This growth was driven by increased net revenue from operations. Greg will discuss our first quarter results in more detail.  Throughout our 2016 we will remain focused on execution around our product portfolio and service platforms. In each of our product lines we know there's opportunity for new and existing customers. We're providing agents with the resources to take advantage of cross-selling potential. We're helping our agents identify customers with standalone Erie products, recognizing their need for additional or different insurance protection. The goal is to ensure our customers have total coverage with Erie while maximizing the agency relationship.  To provide that kind of inclusive coverage, we're looking to our current customers and evolving -- for their evolving needs. As you know, last year we introduced a number of new or enhanced products across all lines : personal, commercial and life. In 2016 we will continue to promote and further expand these products throughout our footprint.  In personal lines, we're leveraging the popularity of our ridesharing coverage and our new motorcycle product. Erie\u2019s motorcycle coverage has been especially well received, with exposures up 150% in the past six months where we're offering this coverage.  We're also expanding our commercial portfolio. Our custom collection suite of products allows agents to sell more effectively to targeted classes of business. So far this year we've added auto service and retailers to the collection. Technology related businesses and professional offices will be added by year end.  Our commercial portfolio will also benefit from enhanced coverage we're adding to our current mechanical and electrical breakdown product. Until now equipment breakdown required evidence of actual physical damage. Going forward this renamed equipment breakdown coverage will automatically include protection when physical damage is not detectable or when software failure causes non-physical damage. This new product is known as Tech Advantage. Erie is the first major carrier to include this valuable coverage.  Offering this additional critical protection for today's business owners gives us a competitive advantage and it\u2019s another way we support our commitment to be above all in service to our customers.  Beyond our product expansion, we're also growing our market presence in commercial lines through an increased focus on middle market. We've established a dedicated team to enhance consistent underwriting, loss control and claim support for these middle market accounts. We will continue expand our capabilities in this area and will add new capabilities to address additional business classes not currently reflected in Erie\u2019s book. We see this as an exciting revenue and market driver for Erie and we'll keep you posted on our progress.  In terms of geographic expansion, our newest territory, Kentucky, continues to be a great story. Direct written premiums are already exceeding early expectation. In 2016 we will continue to expand our presence there.  Our claims operations will also see continued improvements in 2016. Auto claims will be added to the claim center platform, continuing the execution, refreshing our claims technology, one of our key strategic initiatives. Additionally, we are improving our first notice of loss process. A centralized team housed in our home office will provide greater consistency and efficiency. This team will answer claim calls from our entire footprint 24x7 giving customers the quality service they need during a vulnerable time. That's the kind of smart thinking and executing that we\u2019re asking every Erie employee and agent to embrace, so we remain relevant with customers and competitive with our peers.  Finally, I would like to welcome two new members of our Board of Directors : LuAnn Datesh, Vice President, CNX Gas Corporation, and retired Erie Executive George Lucore. LuAnn and George bring a wealth of knowledge and experience and will be true assets to our board.  I will now ask Greg Gutting to provide the detail of our financial results for the quarter. Greg Gutting : Thank you, Terry. As Terry mentioned, our first quarter results continued to build on the success we had in 2015. Net income was $0.87 per diluted share compared to $0.74 in the first quarter of last year. This growth was driven by increased revenue from operations and lower expense growth.  Revenue from operations grew by $24 million. This meaningful top line growth represents a 6.8% increase over the prior year period and it's consistent with the 7.1% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange.  For the quarter, cost of operations grew $8.7 million or 2.9% to $307 million. Commission expense grew $15 million or 7.7%, primarily driven by the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange and higher agent incentive costs related to profitable growth.  Non-commission expenses decreased $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the quarter information technology costs decreased $4.7 million due to decreased professional fees. Administrate and other costs decreased $2.6 million due to a decrease in personnel costs.  For the quarter, net revenue from operations before taxes totaled $68 million, up $15 million over the prior year quarter. Revenue growth outpaced expense growth, increasing our gross margin to 18.1% compared to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2015.  Indemnity\u2019s investment income for the quarter was down $4 million compared to the same period in 2015. Of that $4 million decrease, $3 million represents a decrease in our limited partnership investment return. As a reminder, this portion of our portfolio is in run-off and continues to produce variable return. Finally, in the first three months of 2016 we are pleased to have paid $34 million in dividends to our shareholders.  I'll now turn the call back over to Terry. Terry Cavanaugh : Thank you, Greg. I think we\u2019d like to now open up the call to any questions anybody might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Unidentified Analyst : Terry Cavanaugh : End of Q&A Terry Cavanaugh : All right. Not hearing any questions we will come up with my closing comments then. I want to thank you for your participation on the call this morning. We produced strong financial results this quarter. They were created by our long term execution and unwavering commitment to our customer service proposition and agency partnership philosophy. I look forward to working with my Erie colleagues and our great agents for the remainder the year as we build upon the strong strategy and effective execution. Thank you all for your time. Scott Beilharz : Thanks again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Once again Erie has delivered another strong quarter. Net income was $61 million resulting in earnings per share of a $1.17 compared to a $1.7 in the second quarter of last year. Additionally, our operating margin continues to improve increasing 2.8 points to 20.2% in the quarter compared to the same period last year. These solid results reinforce our performance for the first half of the year and speak to the service commitment of our dedicated agents and employees. And now before Greg provides more detail around our results. I\u2019d like to introduce Erie\u2019s next President and CEO, Tim NeCastro. As you know, Tim was chosen by Erie\u2019s Board of Directors to become my successor and we made that announcement in early June. I'm pleased to say that Tim will officially take on the role of CEO on Monday, August 1. I will continue in my role as President to be available to Tim and the Erie to the remainder of 2016. Tim is a 20-year member of the Erie family and has served on the senior leadership team here since 1997. He's held the positions of Controller, Senior Vice President of Customer Service and most recently Senior Vice President of the West region. With that experience, Tim brings financial, sales, and service acumen to the top job. He has excelled as a leader here and he understands the culture and core values that make us distinctive in the industry. For the past two months, Tim and I've been working closely together to ensure a smooth transition and I'm confident that under Tim's leadership Erie will be in very good hands. Congratulations and welcome Tim. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim for a few comments. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Terry's remarks that Erie is in a great place. During his tenure, Terry has been a relentless advocate for hiring and developing talent and challenging us to think smarter as evident in our strong balance sheet and our operating results. We continue to be with this robust organization today largely as a result of the knowledge and guidance Terry has provided over the past eight years. As a leadership at Erie transitions we won't lose sight of the gains we\u2019ve made under Terry's direction. Certainly we\u2019ll continue to change and evolve that our success on many fronts suggests a sustained and engaged effort. As CEO my focus will be on three key areas. First, we will fortify our core strength by improving our products and services and by developing new offerings enabling us to capitalize on a changing world. Second, we will continue to be responsible stewards of Erie\u2019s strong balance sheet. And third, we will further engage our dedicated agents and employees challenging them to deliver on our service promise in ways that continue to distinguish us in the marketplace. Throughout 2016, our advanced programs already underway has focus on innovation and I'll dedicate resources to other opportunities that will position Erie for the future. I\u2019ll also be working to shape Erie\u2019s Executive team going forward. Earlier this week Greg Gutting was appointed Chief Financial Officer. Greg brings solid experience and strong financial expertise to the position and I have great confidence in Greg's ability to lead our financial team. With that I\u2019d like to congratulate him and officially welcome him as a member of Erie\u2019s executive team. Congratulations, Greg. Gregory Gutting : Thank you, Tim. I look forward to working with you and the executive team. And now I'll report on Erie\u2019s second quarter results. As you saw on the earnings release yesterday Erie had a solid second quarter. Net income per diluted share was up from a $1.07 in the second quarter of last year to $1.17 this year. This improvement was generated by both increased revenue from operations and careful expense management. Revenue from operations grew by $22 million in the quarter representing a 5.5% increase in the topline compared to the same period last year and is consistent with the 5.8% increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange. We continue to generate increases in both policies in force and average premium per policy in all our major product lines supporting this growth. Turning to our quarterly expenses, commission related expenses increased $12 million or 5.4% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The increase was driven primarily by the 5.8% increase in direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange and higher agent incentive costs related to profitable growth. Partially offsetting the commission expense increase was the 5.2% decrease in non-commission related expenses. During the second quarter of 2016 non-commission related expenses totaled $102 million down from a $108 million last year as a result of our commitment to prudent expense management. This $6 million savings resulted primarily from lower information technology, professional fees and personnel related costs and lower credit card processing fees. For the quarter net revenue from operations before taxes totaled $86 million up $16 million for over 22% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Similar to the first quarter of this year we are pleased that revenue growth once again outpaced expense growth, significantly improving our operating margin from 17.4% in the second quarter of last year to 20.2% in the second quarter of this year. Turning to Indemnity\u2019s investment results. The second quarter saw investment income decreased by $8 million compared to last year's second quarter. The decrease is attributable to a decrease in returns from our limited partnership investments. Again, be mindful that this portion of our portfolio is in run-off and we expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class. Finally, our continued growth and profitability has enabled us to pay $34 million in dividends to our shareholders in the second quarter of this year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Terry. Terrence Cavanaugh : Thank you, Greg and congratulations. Before we take your questions, I want to share a few updates with you. We recently opened an innovation lab for our best and brightest. This collaborative space offers our talented employees a stimulating environment that encourages creative and innovative thinking. It\u2019s indicative on our commitment to developing new products and services that will resonate with our customers and reflect the emerging opportunities in the marketplace. In the year\u2019s to come, I'm confident; Tim will be sharing some of the exciting developments that will come from the team's efforts in the innovation lab. Under Tim\u2019s leadership, I know Erie will continue to encourage new and different thinking. We will continue to promote and test new ideas and technology pushing ourselves knowing that as technology gets smarter, we have to get smarter. Finally, Erie continues to earn third-party recognition for our performance and results. Last month, A.M. Best reaffirmed our A+ Superior rating for the property and casualty group. We were also recognized by J.D. Power and Associates in three separate studies. We are in the top spot in the auto insurance shopping study for the fourth year in a row. We were highest in customer satisfaction for the mid-Atlantic region and the auto insurance satisfaction study and we moved up a notch time for third place in the property claims study. Together, these recognitions affirm our ongoing commitment to being above all in service. And once again we have been listed among the Fortune 500 companies. It's another acknowledgement that our value proposition continues to resonate with the marketplace. I think I can speak for both Tim and myself when I tell you it's an exciting time to be leading this organization. Erie is in a good place. We are growing and profitable. We have a deep bench of talent, proven financial strength, strong agency relationships, and an unwavering commitment to service. All position Erie well for a sound prosperous future. It has been my privilege to lead this great organization over the last eight years. I want to thank my fellow team members at Erie, our dedicated and talented agents, and our customers for the confidence they have placed in me and the wisdom they have imparted to me. Coming out of Notre Dame 41 years ago, I would have never imagined the career I have experienced. I am grateful to all. I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my professional and personal journey. Thank you. And now, we will open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] : : End of Q&A Scott Beilharz : Okay. There are no questions. Thanks again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at Erie code 814-870-7312.

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Scott Beilharz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Christine, and welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's discussion about the third quarter 2016 results. Joining me today are Tim NeCastro, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean McLaughlin, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we hear from Tim and Greg, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the Company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the Safe Harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC dated October 27, 2016 and in the related press release. Also during this call, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the GAAP-based results can be found in our Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC yesterday. This call is being recorded and recording is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. A replay will be available on our Web site today after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time. Your participation on this call constitutes your consent to recording, its publication, webcast and broadcast and the use of your name, voice and comments by Erie Indemnity. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you today and to share our results and to briefly introduce our new leadership team. Let me start by acknowledging that as approach the end of 2016 Erie is in a very good place. Indemnity reported solid gains and net income for both the third quarter and year-to-date resulting in earnings per share of $3.14 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $2.75 for the same period in 2015. The 6.1% year-to-date increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange drove our strong topline growth and we continue to outpace Conning's industry forecast of 3.6% for 2016. Furthermore our operating margins continue to grow as we manage expenses wisely. Given the backdrop of a solid financial performance, I'm very excited to share with you some decisions regarding Erie's new Executive Council. Experienced Erie leaders are being promoted to oversee our sales, products, claims and customer service operations. Doug Smith who currently serves as Interim Executive Vice President of Product, Sales and Marketing has been named Executive Vice President of Sales and Products. Lorianne Feltz currently Senior Vice President of Customer Service will take on the extended role of Executive Vice President of Claims and Customer Service. Both Doug and Lorianne have substantial tenure and knowledge of the Erie. They are well prepared and committed to lead these areas critical to Erie's mission and our success. Additionally I've asked Sherri Silver, Senior Vice President of Strategic Marketing to join our Executive Council. In addition to our marketing expertise, Sherri's proven financial and analytical acumen, as well as her insight and strategic abilities operate great value to our team. Doug, Lorianne and Sherri round out our Executive Council whose members also include Greg Gutting, Chief Financial Officer; Bob Ingram, Chief Information Officer; Sean McLaughlin, our General Counsel; Dionne Wallace Oakley, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Dave Bednar, Vice President and our Executive Support. And as we shared on the last call, Terry Cavanaugh's is continuing to operate his guidance and support through the end of this year. As a leader at Erie and throughout my career, I've always encouraged diversity of perspective and candid respectful collaboration and I will continue to take that approach for our Executive Council. I have great confidence that together with Erie employees and agents, we\u2019ll continue shaping successful path into the future. Now with the team in place, we\u2019ll sharpen our focus on strategic initiatives and delivering our promise of superior protection and service at the lowest possible cost. We will continue to make investments in our employees and agents and the technology that supports the work. At the same time our approach to expense management will remain disciplined and balanced to enable our continued growth. While we're pleased with our performance, we will continue to challenge ourselves and look for new opportunities to make the Erie experience even better for all those we serve. We made significant progress this month with the rollout of our new platform supporting our claims processing. As you know we launched claims under last year at this time with our workers compensation line. This month we began moving our largest line of business auto, along with boat and garage into the new claim system. We're on track to implement all other lines in 2017. While processing improvements and its revolutionary, they are necessary for the kind of steady increase in efficiency and effectiveness that are the backbone of any company that wants to remain relevant and continue growing. Claim center for example has enabled us to reduce the time it takes to settle a claim and provide greater consistency and service. It also established a springboard for process improvements with our agents. An easier process for taking loss reports means the reagents and better focus on providing the human touch that customer's value. Further enhancing the customer experience, we anticipate the completion of our first notice of loss centralization and specialization efforts in early 2017. Since its inception one year ago, we've seen a decrease in the amount of time it takes to handle a claim and improve customer satisfaction scores. And our efforts have not gone unnoticed. Just last week we received another affirmation that Erie continues to improve its customer service capability. Erie ranked second among insurers in the 2016 J.D. Power and Associates Auto Claims Satisfaction Study. Improving from sixth place last year, the results put Erie at our highest ever point total in five service related categories and well above the industry average. Finally before I ask Greg to expand on our financial results I\u2019d like to express on behalf of all of us at Erie, our deep concern for those impacted by Hurricane Matthew. In addition to the immediate service of our first responders, Erie will make a monetary contribution through relief efforts in North Carolina for customers suffered the greatest hardship. I'd also like to share my profound personal gratitude to our clients, employees and our agents. Our co-founder H.O. Hirt liked to say that insurance is nothing if not a service industry. Severe weather events like Hurricane Matthew put back at to the test and once again our Erie team fulfilled that promise. I'll turn the call over to Greg now to report our third quarter and year-to-date results. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thank you, Tim. Our third quarter results reinforce the strong position we continue to experience in 2016. As Tim said earlier, careful expense management helped revenue growth outpace expense growth in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, driving solid gains in net income. In the third quarter, net income was $57 million or $1.09 per diluted share compared to $50 million or $0.94 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, net income was $165 million or $3.14 per diluted share compared to $145 million or $2.75 for the same period in 2015. The third quarter operating revenue increased $22 million or 5.5% over last year's third quarter. For the first nine months of 2016, operating revenue increased $68 million or 5.9%, compared to the first nine months of 2015. Growth in both the quarter and the year is consistent with the increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange as policies in force and average premium per policy continue to grow in all major product lines. Operating expenses grew $8 million and $23 million for the quarter and nine months when compared to the same period last year. In the third quarter, commissions increased $9 million compared to the third quarter of 2015 bringing the total commission increase for the first nine months to $36 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in both the quarter and the year was driven by an increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange. Non-commission expense decreased $1 million and $13 million in the third quarter and nine months of the year compared to the same period in 2015. We are pleased with these results and we continue to exercise prudent expense management. For example in the first quarter, we implemented some changes that decreased our credit card processing fees. At the same time, we recognized that we benefited from favorable conditions this year. For instance, we are experiencing lower pension cost due to an increase in the discount rate and we incurred lower medical cost this year compared to last year. A continued topline growth combined with reduced non-commission expenses resulted in net revenue from operations before taxes for the quarter of $82 million, up $14 million compared to the $68 million in net revenue earned in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, net revenues from operations before taxes totaled $236 million, up $45 million compared to the same period in 2015. As I mentioned, third quarter revenue growth once again outpaced expense growth resulting in an improved operating margin of 19.7%, compared to 17.2% in the third quarter of 2015. And then the operating margin for the first nine months of the year was 19.4%, compared to 16.6% in the first nine months of 2015. Indemnity's investment income before taxes totaled $4 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $7 million in the same period last year and $14 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $29 million in the first nine months of 2015. Losses from limited partnerships were the reason for the decrease in investment income. As I have mentioned in the past, this asset class is in run-off and we are expecting more limited and inconsistent earnings from the asset class. Earlier this month one of our real estate partnership had a sale of its remaining assets that resulted in a distribution generating significant gain, a gain of approximately $7.5 million will be recorded in equity and earnings of limited partnership in our fourth quarter 2016 financial statement. Finally our continued growth and profitability has enabled us to pay dividends in the amount of $102 million to our shareholders in the first three quarters of 2016. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. We had a great year so far delivering on our enduring promise of best-in-class service. And with our executive management team in place, we'll continue to address operational challenges and to capitalize on market opportunities. At the same time we recognize the market and industry challenges are changes are inevitable. Innovation is no longer a buzzword it's a business imperative. We'll respond by emphasizing our distinctive service and by investing in a technology and tools necessary to remain competitive. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Amit Kumar of Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just a few questions I guess to begin with. Number one, going back to Hurricane Matthew, do you have an early read, what the impact might be on your results from Hurricane Matthew? Gregory Gutting : Yes, we are seeing losses coming and we are expecting to incur between $15 million and $20 million on the property/casualty side. Amit Kumar : $15 million to $20 million, okay, that's helpful. Number two, going back to the discussion on the claim system and you talked about the platform being expanded as you head into 2017, is there a way to put maybe some sort of loss ratio impact - in expense ratio or loss ratio impact from the new claim system, is it possible to quantify the impact on results from this system? Gregory Gutting : While there will be a little bit of an incremental cost on the property/casualty operations, the vast majority of its capitalized and you'll see that amortized over probably a seven year period. So there is a slight uptick, although, we've done some all of those things that have actually made us more efficient. So that you are not see it it's currently I believe at 27.5. So this will be part of the claims, but it would be minimal on the whole overall claims adjusting expense ratio which is right around 10. Amit Kumar : And in terms of the loss ratio impact, my sense it's - if it's optimizing the process there might be some sort of an improvement in loss ratio or am I overreaching on that thought process? Timothy NeCastro : Yes, that's part of the trade off here as the investment in technology is going to help us improve our efficiency and it should neutralize the investment we're making in the system. Amit Kumar : Okay. That's helpful. Then moving on to broader marketplace and many companies if you look at The Hartford earlier today on their conference call or if you go back to Travelers and some others they've talked about the loss cost trends in personal auto worsening maybe from a economy et cetera. Could you first of all just talked about the loss cost trend in your personal auto book? What sort of frequency and severity numbers you are seeing in that? And then I'll come back with a follow-up on that. Gregory Gutting : So we are seeing the frequency go up and little bit on the severity, we're seeing the same trends that the rest of the industry is seeing. Amit Kumar : Go ahead. Timothy NeCastro : I'd say we attribute that really too. Certainly we're seeing an increase in the number of miles driven. We're at conference of the Insurance Institute last week and they commented on the report with distracted driving and they really prove, but clearly it's easy to see if you drive up down the highways today. Amit Kumar : That's a fair point. In terms of that trend, is there any sort of pricing initiative in place to address that trend. You know, a lot of peers are talking about putting in a new rate filings and chasing rate more aggressively. I guess it\u2019s a two-part question. Number one, do you anticipate to pursue any rate action? And I guess number two, if not do you expect to market share benefit because other companies are right-sizing their operation? Timothy NeCastro : I would say, we\u2019ve always priced responsively for the marketplace in our experience in the market. We take a longer term view. So we would tend to have more moderate rate actions probably in the competition and we don't have any plans for dramatic rate increases in the organization. And while our losses are running a little harder than normal right now they are moderating. Amit Kumar : Got it. That's actually good to know. The other question I had was sort of fishing gears. Commercial auto is another hotspot for some of the other companies. Can you talk about your trends in that market and is that book comparable to the other larger players or is there a difference in that book? Gregory Gutting : So we are seeing some of the similar trends, now they are not quite as dramatic as the first line of site but we\u2019re seeing a little bit of that as well. Timothy NeCastro : We think some of that is influenced by the type of business that\u2019s in commercial auto and some of the other markets where we tend to focus on automobile fleets, we\u2019re not in the larger vehicle markets and so I think our experience is little more moderate but it\u2019s running comparable to our personal lines automobile experience. Amit Kumar : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. The last question I guess is obvious your targets are different than some of the other companies based on the structure et cetera. How should we think about sort of an overall target combined ratio, what you might be looking at in your internal plans. Can you sort of just broadly talk about that on an overall basis and maybe also if possible delve deeper into personal home owners and on the commercial side. What are some of the internal targets you\u2019re trying to achieve based on the economy as well as the depressed interest rate climate. Thanks. Gregory Gutting : So we take a long-term approach to things and so we\u2019ve a targeted a rate of return that we\u2019re trying to get but we don\u2019t necessarily need to get that each and every year related to every one of our product lines. So I don\u2019t know that we really share our targeted combined ratio but you can see over the year's kind of where we fall in and it\u2019s been fairly stable. The years that have been outliers either positive or negative have been the result of increased or decreased catastrophic losses. Timothy NeCastro : I can comment that what influences, what we\u2019re thinking about in terms of that combined ratio clearly has to encompass a lot of different constituents. So our agent's competitiveness in the marketplace, we\u2019re contemplating relationships with our policyholders and retention of those policyholders as well. So we really don't publish a targeted combined ratio. Amit Kumar : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Operator : [Operator Instructions] That concludes our Q&A session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Scott Beilharz for any further remarks. Scott Beilharz : Thanks again for joining us today. As a reminder a recording of this call will be posted on our Web site erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today.

We appreciate you joining us for today\u2019s discussion about the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported Erie Indemnity\u2019s 2016 results and the numbers were very good across the board. Compared to 2015, net income was up over 20% and our gross margin improved by nearly 3 points. Premiums written and assumed by Erie Insurance Exchange drove Indemnity\u2019s top line growth while continued attention to expense management help to improve the bottom line. We had a really good year and I\u2019m very pleased to report record earnings per share of $4.01. As you know, the growth and profitability of the Exchange is an integral part of Indemnity\u2019s success. So with that relationship in mind, I\u2019ll offer some context around the performance of the Exchange before Greg reviews Indemnity\u2019s 2016 financial results. The results for last year affirm that the Exchange remains strong growing profitably. In 2016, record written premiums of the Exchange increased 6.2% over 2015, well ahead of Conning\u2019s current industry forecast of 3.6%, and for 2016, the Exchange reported a combined ratio of 96.5%. That too surpassed Conning\u2019s most recent industry forecast of 99.8%. Policyholder surplus is now just over $7.7 billion. The Exchange is indeed thriving and Indemnity continues to benefit from that solid performance. Indemnity also generated very strong results in 2016. The 2016 was more than just a year of strong performance. It was also a transitional year at Erie, marked by a new executive leadership in the anticipation of what that change might look like internally. And through that change, our employees and agents remain true through to our service promise conducting business with the dedication and expertise that allowed for a seamless transition and record results with no disruption to our operation. I\u2019m very thankful to our employees and agents for their consistent professionalism and dedication. We accomplished a great deal operationally last year as well. Always mindful that we need to make it easier for our agents and customers to do business with us, we ramped up replacement of our legacy claims infrastructure. We provided the training and resources our employees need to succeed and in an effort to remain current and competitive in the marketplace, we expanded our product offerings. One of our greatest accomplishments last year was the expansion of our new claims management system to service our largest line of business, automobile. In addition to that, we introduced the new online loss reporting process for agents enabling them to enhance the customers\u2019 claim experience from the start. Erie Claim Center is the largest technology improvement we\u2019ve made in recent history, and we rolled it out on time and on budget. Although, there are always challenges with a project of this magnitude, this platform replacement together with our newly centralized first notice of loss team and the ability to pay claims electronically demonstrates our commitment to provide the best possible claim service well into the future. We also invested in our greatest asset, our employees. Utilizing our state-of-the-art technical learning center, we provided ongoing education and training to over 500 employees and agents in 2016, both in the classroom and with hands on experience. And our innovation lab besides providing collaborative space for internal teams hosted crowdsourcing events for IT employees, interns and apprentices allowing them to work alongside programmers and developers from other businesses in our community. These day long sessions generated many new ideas some of which are now in our innovation pipeline for further research and development. We also continue to offer new and improved products keeping our agents strong and our customers protected. In personal automobile, for example, our motorcycle and ridesharing products continue to be very well received as we introduced them into more states. And in our homeowners line, we introduced new coverages for underground service line damage and equipment breakdown, helping to fill common coverage gaps. In commercial lines, our custom collection suite of products was offered to additional business classes throughout the year. Finally, our accomplishments last year did not go unnoticed. We\u2019re very proud of the fact that we continue to earn recognition from J.D. Power and others reinforcing the fact that we are good at what we do. So as we look ahead to this year and beyond, we\u2019ll continue to capitalize and build on our proven business model. I\u2019ll talk more about our business model and our strategic focus going forward after Greg discusses our 2016 financial results. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Yesterday, we reported excellent 2016 financial results for both the fourth quarter and full-year. Beginning with the fourth quarter results, net income increased to $46 million, or $0.87 per diluted share compared to $30 million, or $0.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The growth was driven by increased revenues, net revenues from operations and total investment income. Net revenue from operations before taxes increased nearly $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a 35% increase over the fourth quarter of 2015. Indemnity\u2019s management fee revenue increased $23 million, or 6.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015, while the cost of operations increased 2.7%, or just over $8 million in the same period. Commission-related expenses in the fourth quarter increased $10 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, while non-commission-related expenses decreased nearly $2 million during that same period. Our resulting gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 14.9% versus a 11.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Finally, investment income for the quarter totaled $13.5 million compared to $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase was driven primarily by earnings from our limited partnerships. Indemnity\u2019s full-year results also tell a story of strong growth. Net income for the year was $210 million, or $4.01 per diluted share compared to $175 million, or $3.33 per diluted share in 2015. The increased earnings were driven by net revenue from operations as revenue growth outpaced expense growth. As a result, Indemnity\u2019s gross margin for the full-year 2016 was 18.3% compared to 15.4% in 2015. Management fee revenue in 2016 increased $92million, or 6.2% compared to 2015, while the total operating expenses increased just over $31 million, or 2.5% year-over-year. When we talk about expenses, we make a distinction between commission-related and non-commission-related costs. Commissions paid to independent agents are the largest component of our cost of operations. For the year, commissions increased nearly $46 million, or 5.4% compared to 2015, driven by the 6.2% increase in direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange. Several factors contributed to a $14.6 million, or 3.4% decrease in non-commission costs for the year compared to 2015. Year-over-year, information technology expenses were down over $2 million as a result of decreased personnel costs and customer service expenses decreased nearly $5 million, as we incurred fewer credit card processing fees. Administrative costs decreased almost $8 million due to decreased personnel costs, including incentive compensation forfeited by departing senior executives in 2016. Personnel costs in 2016 benefited from decreased pension costs and lower medical costs due to favorable medical claims experience compared to 2015. Pension costs decreased primarily due to an increase in the pension discount rate compared to 2015. However, pension benefit costs will increase in 2017 as a result of a lower discount rate and a lower assumed expected return on assets in 2017. Finally, Indemnity\u2019s income from investment before taxes was $27.8 million in 2016 compared to $33.7 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in limited partnership earnings. And once again, I\u2019ll remind you that this asset class is in run [ph] and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from these investments. Our 2016 results confirm that Indemnity had a very good year. Both superior performance and the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to return a $136 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2016. And in December, our Board approved a 7.2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for both Class A and Class B shares for 2017. Our financial strength also has enabled us to invest in the future with the construction of our new office building. Construction is expected to take approximately three years to complete. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. As we look ahead to 2017 and Erie\u2019s business approach, our executive team isn\u2019t looking for revolutionary changes to our business model. We will capitalize on our brand strength evolving it and giving it a contemporary look. I know with certainty that we\u2019ll have to address disruptive trends in our industry and that the customer of the future will have a new face and new expectation. And while change won\u2019t happen overnight, the evolving needs of the customer is the certainty that will help shape our priorities. We remain unquestionably committed to our proven distribution channel. Our dedicated independent agents will continue to be the face of Erie forging lasting relationships with our customers. It will be our job to build out the core and improve our existing business model. We will continue to strengthen the Erie experience for our agents, customers, and employee by linking digital capabilities with our distinctive human touch and becoming more efficient on a 24/7 timetable. We want to Erie to always be the agents and customers coverage of choice. We will also respond to changing consumer behavior, new risk patterns, and the needs that arise from emerging technology, and we will continue to look for prime opportunities to grow market share. And as we did with Erie Claim Center, we will look closely at our infrastructure and begin our journey of replacing legacy platforms and solutions to improve efficiency, service, and data management paramount to better decision-making in our business. We will examine the workforce and workplace of tomorrow focusing on the skills, capabilities, and space needed to succeed in a changing industry. We will continue to recruit and develop talent and provide the environment that will keep our employees engage, while allowing us to meet new levels of service for customers and agents. Flexibility were possible leads to happier, healthier, and more productive employees. Thinking ahead and anticipating disruptive forces will provide opportunity, our world and our industry are changing. And while that change won\u2019t happen tomorrow, it will happen and we have to start planning for it today. It is in this way that the Exchange will continue to thrive and Indemnity will continue to produce value for you, our shareholders in 2017 and beyond. Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning. Just a few questions, I guess, to start with. Number one, if I look at the combined ratio for private passenger auto, can you just broadly talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the loss cost trends and the rate increases you might be looking at going forward? Timothy NeCastro : Certainly. Good morning, Amit. Erie\u2019s experience is on par, in fact, a little bit better than the industry. And from our perspective, we look at personal lines households, not just at the automobile line of business. And so when we look at things in the aggregate and as our agents sell more package policies, we are seeing very consistent profitability trends for ourselves in the personal lines arena. Certainly, we are seeing increases in loss costs like the industry is seeing. We know that those things are attributable to things like distracted driving and the advent of new technology is being utilized in cars. For Erie, we see relatively moderate rate actions. We tend to handle profitability concerns really with three levers. So while we could take rate and we certainly adjust rates periodically from time to time using sophisticated pricing, we also handle profitability through our agency management practices and our underwriting practices. And really underwriting has been one of the consistent strengths and strategic strengths of Erie for many, many years. Amit Kumar : In terms of when you talk about that, is a loss cost uptick, is that on the bodily injury side, or is that on the property damage side for you? Timothy NeCastro : It\u2019s on the \u2013 it\u2019s predominantly on the property damage side. Amit Kumar : Okay. Timothy NeCastro : Industry is I think \u2013 we are seeing industry results that are far more skewed toward BI than ours are, but we are seeing it more on the PD side and we attribute that to the increased repair cost on automobiles, because there\u2019s so much technology built into them today. Amit Kumar : Got it. Moving on to the commercial auto piece and I know it\u2019s a smaller piece for Erie, that\u2019s one of the new sort of hotspots. Any thoughts on how you expect that to emerge over 2017? Gregory Gutting : This is Greg Gutting. Our book is a little bit different on commercial auto than the industry. So we have like the small fleets and whatnot. So we are not seeing a lot of the same things that the industry is seeing there. Amit Kumar : Got it. The final question I have is, in the past you talked about, I guess, cross-selling, if you will, in terms of personal lines policyholders also owning life insurance policies. Any updated thoughts on the penetration levels on that? Gregory Gutting : We\u2019re seeing \u2013 this is Greg, again. We\u2019re seeing some gains there and that\u2019s something we\u2019re looking to focus on in the future and nothing substantial at this point. Timothy NeCastro : Amit, this is Tim. Really some of the work that we\u2019ve accomplished in the customer arena. It\u2019s really systems based. It\u2019s giving us a broader view of who our customers are and how deeply penetrated we are. I would say, we\u2019re early on. We are seeing some marginal improvement. But we think that some of the work that the foundational work that\u2019s being accomplished is going to help us far more in the future. Amit Kumar : Got it. That makes sense. That \u2013 that\u2019s all I have for now. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Timothy NeCastro : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is now open. Adam Klauber : Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Timothy NeCastro : Good morning, Adam. Adam Klauber : A couple of different questions and sorry, I missed the first part of the call, so I apologize if you had talked about these. Yes, for 2017, how should we think about the direction of some of the expense items, the salaries and some of the other expenses, technology investments, could you \u2013 and I apologize if you said that already, but could you walk through just directionally where the\u2026? Timothy NeCastro : Well, we had the advantage this year of some lower costs. The pension were down just as a function of the discount rate. So those costs are going to go up a little bit in 2017. The medical expenses were down and we\u2019re self insured, so that flows through. So we experienced less medical claims parity there on the larger claims, so we saw some of that. We saw the benefit of some of the \u2013 or the bonus plans for executives who left or where we hadn\u2019t grow up, or which were removed, so that was part of it. We also altered the payment plans that we take credit cards on during 2016, which reduced the credit card expense, which we expect that to go back up a little bit in 2017. So we had \u2013 we were benefited on a few fronts on the 2016 on the expenses. Gregory Gutting : Adam, I would say on the technology front, we\u2019re going to continue to make investments in our legacy platform replacing that platform. And it\u2019s difficult to predict what the expense stream is going to look like. A lot of it is kind of built on itself, but we expect 2017 to be a very rigorous year in the technology arena. Adam Klauber : Okay. And as far as other expenses non-tech and again not looking for exact numbers. But are there going to be investments, or is it just more normal growth of the expense base next year? Gregory Gutting : And we continually invest not only in IT, but in other process improvement and customer experience things. But I don\u2019t see any major expenditures there, but it\u2019s more in line with what we\u2019ve done in the past. Adam Klauber : Okay, okay. Then how are you thinking about cash usage for 2017, or what are your priorities? Gregory Gutting : Well, we have very good cash flows with the building coming on. We actually were able to leverage our strength there and lock in a very good rate for financing most of the buildings. So I see that\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Timothy NeCastro : Really I\u2019d say predominantly to fund our operation, of course, fund dividends for shareholders, we don\u2019t anticipate any major drains on cash in 2017. Adam Klauber : Okay. So still mainly dividends, buyback, is that consideration, or not that much? Gregory Gutting : The dividends for sure the buybacks. Timothy NeCastro : Yes, look at those\u2026 Gregory Gutting : Yes. Timothy NeCastro : If it\u2019s opportunistic. Gregory Gutting : Yes. Adam Klauber : Okay. And then as far as growth of the agency for us, I guess, which states or which areas do you think you\u2019ll see some pockets of growth this year? Gregory Gutting : Yes, I mean, we\u2019ve had some \u2013 we\u2019ve had a relatively stable agency portion in terms of numbers of agencies, it\u2019s been hovering around 2,250 agencies or so. And we continue to make appointments in some of the newer territories, or lesser developed territories like Tennessee and Illinois. I would continue to see those types of appointments occur. The license producers is the area where we\u2019re seeing greater growth. We\u2019ve seen increase of almost 3,000 licensed producers over the past five years, and so now we\u2019re around 4,500 producers up there. So that\u2019s growth within existing agencies. I think that the number, I think that we\u2019re averaging around $2.9 million of direct written premium per agency, as we sit here today, and that\u2019s up from about $1.7 million about five years ago. So we are more deeply penetrated in the existing agency plant. Adam Klauber : Great, great. So as we think about 2017, maybe not a lot of growth in the agency for us, but continued growth on those and that number of producers, is that a way to think about it? Gregory Gutting : Yes. Now my feel [ph] dimension, we\u2019ll be appointing producers in Kentucky, our newest territory as well. Adam Klauber : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Gregory Gutting : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Scott Beilharz for any closing remarks. Scott Beilharz : Thanks, Nichole. Excuse me, thanks again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website, erieinsurance.com at 4 :30 PM Eastern time today. If you have any questions, please call me at Erie code 814-870-7312. Thank you. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

I'd like to introduce your host for today's call, Scott Beilharz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's discussion about the 2017 first quarter results. Joining me today are Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean McLaughlin, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our Web site, erieinsurance.com. We will start the call today with opening remarks from Tim and Greg, and then, we will open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the Safe Harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC dated May 1, 2017 and in the related press release.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks Scott, and good morning, everyone. Just last week we held our annual meeting with shareholders here at our home office in Erie. As I noted at the meeting, 2016 was truly a great year for Erie. Even the year of transition, the efforts our employees and our agent partners delivered record results and positioned us well for continued strong performance again this year. In the first three months of 2017, growth of 6.7% in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange bolstered our top-line as we continued to outpace forecasted results for the industry. At the end of the first quarter, policyholder surplus is nearing $8 billion. The strong surplus position allows us to meet our commitment of policyholders after the loss. During the first quarter, bad weather played a more prominent role than it did in 2016. That is evident in our reported combined ratio of 100.3, a 5 point increase over the first quarter of 2016. The weather impact was not due to an individual large event, instead we responded to a number of smaller events at the end of February, in the beginning of March, which called on the skilled service of our dedicated cat team. The spring storms impacted nearly every operating territory and the cat team has had a presence in more than 90% of our agent offices affected by the weather, servicing over 12,500 customers impacted by weather related claims. In addition, [indiscernible] in our personal auto line of business similar to the rest of the industry. The first quarter results are showing signs of lost cost trends moderating, but obviously it's too early to make any definitive statement on how the year will develop. We will continue to address profitability consistent with our past practices using a measured approach of taking rate with a long-term view, a strong underwriting focus on new business and focused re-underwriting on our existing book. This will allow us to improve profitability in the personal auto line without shocking our customers. In a minute, Greg will talk more about our first quarter financial results. But first, I would like to recognize Bob Wilburn, a long time member of our Board, who recently retired. Bob joined the Indemnity Board in 1999 serving at many capacities over the years. During his tenure on the Board, Bob served as Chairman of our Audit and Executive Compensation and Development Committees and was a long-time member of our Charitable Giving Committee. I would like to publicly acknowledge and thank Bob for his many years of service and wish him well in his retirement. I'm also pleased to report that two new Directors for our Board were elected at last week's Annual Shareholder Meeting, Gene Connell and Brian Hudson. Gene isn't new to Erie. During his 23-year tenure with the company, he served in various senior positions including Chief Actuary and Chief Risk Officer. Brian Hudson is Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency. Both Directors will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to our Board and we will look forward to working with them. Now, I will turn the call over to Greg to expand in our first quarter results. Gregory Gutting : Thanks Tim. Net income in the first quarter of 2017 was $48 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $46 million or $0.87 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. The growth was driven by increased investment income in the quarter. Net revenue from operations on a pre-tax basis decreased 1.7% from $68 million in the first quarter of 2016 to $67 million in the first quarter this year. Indemnity's management fee revenue increased nearly $25 million to $392 million or 6.7% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of last year driven by the 6.7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by this exchange as both policies enforced and average premium per policy increased year-over-year. Indemnity's total operating expenses also increased in the quarter to $333 million representing an 8.4% increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. Commissions [indiscernible] agent partners increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by the top-line growth. Non-commission expenses increased $14 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 driven by increases in information technology-related professional fees, underwriting costs and personnel costs including incentive compensation. Indemnity's gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 16.7% versus 18.1% in the first quarter of last year. Indemnity's investment income for the quarter totaled $6.6 million compared to $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. The $4 million increase was driven by higher net investment income coupled with realized investment gains and equity and earnings of limited partnerships. Finally, in the first three months of 2017, we returned $36 million in dividends to our shareholders. And now, I will turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks Greg. As our financial results confirmed, we're off to a strong start again this year. On our last call, I told you that our strategic focus going forward is really a continuation of what we've done to succeed over the years. Let me recap that focus and add a little color around how we're delivering. You may recall that our leadership team identified four areas of strategic focus to help us continue to win in the marketplace. First, we're continuing to enhance the Erie experience for our employees, agents and customers. We're already driving speed and accuracy with our enhanced online e-signature capability, improved claim service and quicker claim settlement. And our underwriters are equipped with better tools and workflows for greater efficiency. We'll continue to deliver improved digital tools throughout the year and in the years ahead. Our second area of focus is around exploring and developing new sources of revenue that will keep Erie and Erie agents strong. New and expanded coverage in both personal lines and commercial lines continue to roll out. Protections that filled the gaps in homeowner's products as well as our custom collection for business owners, for example, have been well received by our customers and we will continue to research new innovative opportunities in the protection arena as we work to expand our market presence. Our third area of focus is around platform replacement and advanced data management. Our new Erie claim center is an important step in replacing our strategic platforms. It's creating greater flexibility and capability for consolidating our abundant claims data. We will continue to evaluate our policy administration platforms in order to expand our capabilities to accelerate the delivery of future products and services and to provide greater ease of use for our employees, agents and customers. Finally, we're focused on preparing the workforce future. This is a commitment to our current and our future employees. We will embrace the evolving tools, resources and environment needed to attract, develop and retain talent in the coming years. Equipping employees with more innovative technology, greater access to on-demand learning opportunities and a support of work environment will give them the competencies needed to thrive in a changing market and aid their efforts to deliver on our service promise. We're confident that developments across these focal areas will enable us to make continued gains in the market share and to continue to create value for you, our shareholders. Before I close, we have some late breaking news. Just yesterday, J.D. Power & Associates released their results for the 2017 insurance shopping study. For the fifth year on a row, Erie achieved the top score for customer satisfaction with the auto insurance purchase experience. This recognition in particular demonstrates our commitment to the Erie experience and I'd like to thank all of our dedicated agents and employees for the role they play in our customer shopping experience. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning and congrats on the J.D. Power recognition. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Amit. Amit Kumar : Just few questions and then I'll re-queue. The first question goes back to the one-time or some of the expense lines and I was wondering if you could just talk about how we should think about the remaining quarters, just to keep on showing up or it's just more one time in nature? Gregory Gutting : Amit, this is Greg Gutting. Our expenses vary from quarter-to-quarter, when you compare this year --this year's first quarter to last year's first quarter, we are seeing an increase in the IT spend, but some of that's related to the first quarter of last year being a little lower than you might expect. Some of the other things on the administrative and other expenses we saw a large increase a couple of million dollars related to the long-term incentive accrual and that was just a function of the stock price -- the company's stock price going up over $10 during the quarter. So, that's some of the detail around what happened during the quarter. Amit Kumar : Got it. Moving on to -- I guess the main focus topic. On the personal auto side, your top -- your premiums grew 10%. Can you talk about what drove that growth and generally where is that business coming from -- is that coming from some other larger national carriers pulling back because of their attempts to improve their underwriting profitability or is there something more going on that front? Timothy NeCastro : Amit, this is Tim. We're seeing it from a variety of places. First, we have taken modest rate increases. I think our average premium for the quarter was up around 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. And we're also seeing robust tiff growth, very balanced growth between policy accounts and average premium. We're seeing that business come from a variety of places, certainly many competitors have taken greater rate increases than we have. And it kind of goes back to our longer term focus. We do our best not to shock our customers or our policyholders and so we tend to moderate our rate increases overtime and take that longer term view and it's showing up in the -- our ability to increase our ratings in automobile. Amit Kumar : Okay. Fair enough. And then, final question, I'll re-queue. Can you talk -- you said that the loss cost trends are moderating a bit, can you just sort of flush that out just talk about the BI and PD component and just sort of give us a quarter over versus past few quarter color? Thanks. Gregory Gutting : This is Greg. We're seeing moderating in the frequency, the severity in the physical damage we're still keeping a close eye on that the lost costs as far as the more expensive vehicles and technology and stuff we still are seeing a little bit of that. The BI severity has been fairly benign. Amit Kumar : Okay. I'll stop here and re-queue. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you. Gregory Gutting : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I show no additional audio questions. We have another follow-up from Mr. Amit Kumar. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Thanks. Maybe just two other clean-up questions. The first question was on the commercial auto, can you talk about how that book is performing and your results seems okay, but maybe just talk about the trends versus the past few quarters? Gregory Gutting : Yes. We're not seeing anything to unusual. Again our -- book of commercial auto is much different than some of our competitors we're the very small personal auto space more like personal lines. And so we're not seeing a long-haul trucking and that sort of thing we don't write that. So it's been pretty benign. Amit Kumar : Got it. And the final question I have is, on the reserve release side, it seemed that I think worker's comp releases seemed a bit higher may be just talk about some of the reserve release numbers. And again, I know that [indiscernible] added to that makes us a deal, but maybe just talk about what years the releases came from? Thanks. Gregory Gutting : That's going to moderate from quarter-to-quarter that it wasn't a big item on our strength, slight changes in what we're seeing nothing major. Amit Kumar : Okay. I'll stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Amit. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no additional audio questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Tim NeCastro for any closing remarks. Scott Beilharz : Hi. This is Scott. Howard, thank you, and thanks, again, everyone for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our Web site, erieinsurance.com after 12 :30 pm Eastern Time today. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at Erie code 814-870-7312. Thank you. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. As reported in our second quarter Form 10-Q filed yesterday, Indemnity had a good first half of the year. We are pleased with the results and confident in the direction we have set for 2017. A quick look at the exchange, the insurance operation we manage shows continued positive results. The direct and assumed premiums written in the first 6 months of 2017 grew 6.2% compared to the same period last year. And we continue to outpace Corning\u2019s industry forecast of 4.5% for the year. Policyholder surplus stands at just over $8 billion, another firm indicator of our operational and financial health. It\u2019s especially relevant as we make continued investments in our business to meet and anticipate changes in the market, in the workforce and in consumer appetite. I will touch on those strategic investments and the specific areas of focus in just a few minutes. But before I hand it over to Greg, let me say that we are very pleased with Indemnity\u2019s results. While on a year-to-year basis, earnings per share are down slightly. Our margin remains very strong even as we purposely invest in technology and processes that will keep us relevant and competitive going forward. Now, I will ask Greg to share the detail and additional context around our financial results. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, we are pleased with the results we are seeing this year. They reflect our commitment to our agents and employees as well as our ongoing investment in infrastructure and platform improvements. Starting with the second quarter of 2017, net income was $$59 million or $1.12 per diluted share compared to $61 million or $1.17 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016. While we continue to generate strong top line growth, net income in the quarter decreased due to a $2.7 million reduction in operating income and a $1 million reduction in investment income. Indemnity\u2019s revenue from operations increased $25 million in the second quarter of 2017, representing a 5.8% increase over the same period in 2016, resulting from the exchange\u2019s steady growth in both policies in force and average premium per policy. This top line growth was offset by increased expenses primarily higher agent compensation costs and technology investments. Indemnity\u2019s commission expenses increased $16 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016 driven by a 5.7% quarter-over-quarter increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange and higher agent incentive cost related to profitable growth. Non-commission expenses also increased compared to the second quarter of 2016. Indemnity\u2019s non-commission expenses increased $12 million driven primarily by a $7 million increase in the information technology costs, including increased professional fees and personnel costs. Other drivers include underwriting and policy processing costs and administrative cost. The resulting gross margin for the second quarter of 2017 was the strong 18.5%, down from a margin of 20.2% recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Keep in mind that the 20.2% margin in last year\u2019s second quarter was the highest margin in any quarter in the last 4 years. We continue to invest in technology and process improvements. So, we expect to see a higher technology costs in some quarters going forward. It\u2019s important to recognize that unlike our new claim center platform that supports the claims function and is therefore paid for by the exchange, many of the cost associated with our technology initiatives going forward will align with sales, underwriting and policy issuance functions and therefore will be paid for by the Indemnity Company. As we make these investments, you will see the margin fluctuate. Indemnity\u2019s investment income in the second quarter of 2017 totaled $6 million compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease was driven by lower earnings from our limited partnership. Indemnity\u2019s year-to-date results tell a similar story. For the first 6 months of 2017, net income was $106 million or $2.03 per diluted share down slightly from the $107 million or $2.04 per diluted share in the first 6 months of 2016. Revenue from operations increased $49 million or 6.2% year-over-year once again in line with the exchange\u2019s strong premium growth. Commissions increased $27 million in the first 6 months of 2017 compared to the same period last year resulting from a 6.2% increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange. Non-commission expense increased $26 million in the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. As in the quarter, the drivers of the increase were higher technology costs, higher underwriting and policy processing costs and higher administrative costs. The gross margin for the first 6 months of 2017 is 17.6% compared to 19.2% in the first 6 months of 2016. Indemnity\u2019s investment income for the first half of 2017 totaled $13 million compared to $10 million in the first half of 2016. Finally, our continued success has enabled us to pay our shareholders $36 million in dividends in the second quarter of 2017. And now, I will turn the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. With Greg\u2019s report as a backdrop, let me touch on the strategic focus areas I mentioned on the last call. These are the areas we are focusing on to sustain and accelerate the positive results of our successful business model. I will share a few examples too of how, where we are delivering value to our agents and customers. As you may recall, we have four strategic focus areas. First, continuing to enhance the Erie experience; second, improving our key strategic platforms in our data management; third, exploring new sources of revenue; and fourth, preparing the workforce for the future. These are areas we believe offer the greatest opportunity for continued growth and success into the future. If you have been engaged in our calls over the past few years, you will recognize that these are really an extension of our direction. For instance, the replacement of our claims platform that began in 2014 is nearing completion and we are working to achieve the same kind of efficiencies and better experience for customers, agents and employees on other legacy systems. Improving how we manage and leverage our data represents a clear opportunity that aligns with updating our technology platforms. Right now, we are bringing together the right talent and teams to elevate our capabilities. The work in this area will enable greater accessibility of usable data companywide and this will help drive better decision making and opportunities for innovation. As I mentioned these focal areas aren\u2019t a shift in our strategic direction, instead they represent a more conservative focus on needs and opportunities for immediate and long-term. In terms of the Erie experience for instance we are introducing process improvements that will enhance speed and flexibility, making it easier for our agents and customers to do business with us, in contemporary ways leveraging digital tools. Our new commercial account quote application system for workers compensation is a good example of how making the process easier leads to increased production. We see new business in this line increased 18% since our agents gained the ability to quote and submit an application electronically. Feedback from both the recent internal survey of agents and our ongoing agent task force meetings demonstrates that our agents agree there is real value in these incremental process improvements. At the same time we are looking ahead and planning for the longer term with our focus on the workforce in the future. Today, we have in place some very successful programs for hiring in advance of need in critical areas like claims, underwriting and field sales. Our most recent hiring session brought in an application pool of more than 600 candidates for just 10 positions. The competition for these programs and the rigor of our selection process guarantees we will get the best of the best. Once hired, we train all new employees to meet our service promise. Our Start Smart program for example continues to prepare new claims employees to confidently meet the needs of our customers on their first day on the job. We also say the future work will demand evolving capabilities and tools, workplace settings and regulatory factors. Our focus on the workforce in the future will allow us to identify and prepare our company, our employees and our agency force for those challenges and opportunities. Many of the initiatives such as our future policy management system will involve multi-year investments of resources, so it\u2019s important that we plan thoughtfully and with the right cadence to support our continued success for Erie and our agents. As we move forward, we do so from a steady position of strength. Thanks to the work of our dedicated team of agents and employees. We are listed once again among the Fortune 500 and the work of our Erie team also led to continue recognition from our customers. For the fifth consecutive year, we earned the highest score in the J.D. Power and Associates Insurance Shopping Study. It\u2019s a great affirmation of the value of our independent agent business model, trusted advisors those seeking financial protection. And finally, we learned recently that A.M. Best once again affirmed the financial health of our property and casualty group with an A+ superior rating. All of these reflect the firm foundation on which Erie was built and which we remain deeply committed to sustaining. And now we would be happy to take any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is open. Adam Klauber : Thanks. Good morning. Tim NeCastro : Good morning Adam. Adam Klauber : Couple of different questions, how fast did the commercial business versus the personal lines businesses grow in the second quarter? Greg Gutting : The personal lines businesses is growing faster than commercial, a lot of that has to do with the rate of personal lines are in the private passenger auto as well as the growth we are seeing there in new production. Adam Klauber : And roughly how much rate are you getting on the auto side? Greg Gutting : About 5%. Adam Klauber : 5%, okay. How is the competitive environment in auto, are most companies pushing rate and are you sort of in that mid \u2013 are most of the companies pushing for roughly 5% rate or are they pushing for more than 5%? Tim NeCastro : Adam, I would say that most of them are pushing for at least that and on a relative basis our competitive position in auto is improving. We have looked at the business more holistically in personal lines as a package. We like to sell more than a single policy. And so in previous years, we had to make some great corrections in our homeowners\u2019 product. We are now making some corrections in auto, but our rate indications are relatively benign at this point. Adam Klauber : Okay. Okay, great. And then the technology project, how long do you think that\u2019s going to last and which vendor \u2013 vendors are using for the different systems? Tim NeCastro : Yes. So Adam, we\u2019ll wrap up the first element of the strategic platform project, the claim center, which is a Guidewire installation when we released the property lines this fall. We have not selected a vendor for the balance of the programs yet and we are evaluating a combination of potential internal solutions and external solutions. Those decisions as there may, will drive the overall duration of the program and we will have more information on that probably on the third quarter call. Adam Klauber : Okay. Okay, thanks. And then how is growth of the agency force both from a number standpoint and also from a productivity standpoint? Tim NeCastro : At this point, the number of agencies is growing, but relatively on a very slow basis. What we are seeing is growth within the existing agency force and so we are pretty much on average, the average agency is growing in line with the overall company growth in premium. Adam Klauber : Okay, okay. Thanks a lot. Tim NeCastro : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Frederick Shepard of Capital Returns Management. Your line is open. Frederick Shepard : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just real quick on the commission expense ratio, can you break that into base commissions versus bonus commissions and other accruals and maybe how does that split compared to last year? Greg Gutting : This is Greg. The splits are similar. I believe I don\u2019t have it in front of me, but I believe we are about 85% of the commissions are the base and the rest is profitability bonus and other age incentive costs. Frederick Shepard : Okay, great. And is that a pretty standard split? Greg Gutting : It generally is. I mean, it can vary, but it\u2019s been fairly consistent over the last 2 years. Frederick Shepard : Okay, great. And then how much of the salary expense had a bonus commission tied to it this quarter and maybe in the year-over-year quarter? Greg Gutting : The salary? Frederick Shepard : Yes. Greg Gutting : There is no bonus commission to the \u2013 I guess I am confused about your question. Tim NeCastro : You mean incentive comp versus base comp? Frederick Shepard : Yes, yes. Tim NeCastro : That I don\u2019t know, if we\u2026 Greg Gutting : We have had \u2013 the incentive comp has increased a couple of million dollars for the year 2 to 3. Some of that is driven by the long-term incentives where they are tied to the stock price and the stock price is up over $13 for the year. So, that\u2019s driving a lot of it, most of it actually. Frederick Shepard : Great. Thank you so much, guys. Tim NeCastro : Yes, thank you. Operator : I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Scott Beilharz for any further remarks. Scott Beilharz : Thanks, Ashley and thanks again everyone for joining our call today. A recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsuramce.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today. If you have any questions, please call me at 814-870-7312. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude your program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thank you, Scott. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Yesterday we reported strong results for Indemnity Company. Slight gains net income for the quarter and year-to-date resulted in earnings per share of $3.15 for the first nine months of 2017. This is consistent with the result for the same period last year. And, our management margin remained strong as we exercise prudent expense management including our ongoing investments in technology. Top line growth was driven by a 6% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. We continue to outpace Corning\u2019s industry forecast of 4.7% for 2017. Furthermore the top line growth was profitable growth. The exchange report of the combined ratio of 96% for the first nine months of 2017 affirming our underwriting discipline. In a minute Greg will give details on our financial results, but before I turn it over to him, I would like to offer my thoughts on the hurricanes [on mild fire] that have devastated so many recently. Although our territories were not directly impacted, the runner severe weather is already reminder for us. We are partners in the industry, vital to economic stability, and vital to those whose lives suddenly become vulnerable. I now speak on behalf of all of us in the ERIE family when I say our hearts and thoughts remain for those affected by this recent weather event. And, we are committed to continuing our monetary support of the web prost and their efforts to provide aid. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg to report on our result. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks Tim, and good morning. As Tim pointed our 2017 third quarter and year-to-date results remain strong, given our thoughtful support for our agents and employees and our commitment to provide the tools for their success. In the quarter, net income was $59 million or $1.12 per diluted share compared to $57 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016. Year-to-date net income is flat at a $165 million for both 2017 and 2016 resulting in $3.15 per diluted for the first nine months of 2017 and $3.14 per diluted for the same period in 2016. Operating revenue in the quarter was up 5.8% to $442 million from $480 million. And, for the first nine months of 2017, operating revenue was up 6% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the first nine months of last year. Growth in the quarter and in the year reflect a steady increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange as both fall season and average premium policy continue in a positive direction in both personal and commercial line. Indemnity\u2019s operating expenses increased $26 million or 7.6% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date operating expenses increased $79 million or 8% compared to the first nine months of last year. If you recall that approximately that are approximately two-thirds of Indemnity\u2019s operating expenses are commission based. Commissions increased $60 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $44 million for the first nine months of this year compared to the same respective period in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increases in the direct and assumed premium written by the exchange, as well as increased incentive costs related to profitable growth. Non-commission expenses increased $9 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $35 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. For both the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, primary drivers were increased cost in underwriting and policy processing, customer service, information technology, and administrative related. Well, the underwriting policy processing and customer service expenses are tied more directly to our increase in business. Overall expenses are in line with our expectation as we take deliberate action to deliver on our areas of strategic focus. You may recall that I told you last quarter that more of our expenses will align with Indemnity Company. As we upgrade our platforms and data capability. With that in mind we are very pleased with our strong operating margin. For the third quarter and year-to-date 2017 Indemnity\u2019s gross margin was 18.3% and 17.9% respectively compared to 19.7% and 19.4% for the same period in 2016. Total investment income increased by $4 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 an increase by $7 million for the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increased earnings in the quarter were driven by limited partnership return, while the increase for the first nine months was driven by increase net investment income, limited partnership returns, and realized capital gain. Finally our continued growth and profitability has enabled us to pay our shareholders dividend in the amount of $109 million in the first three quarters of 2017. And, now I\u2019ll the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. Now I\u2019ll provide brief updates on some of the initiatives we are working, we continue to execute our strategic focus. As a reminder we\u2019ve identified all broad areas that we believe support continue growth, well I\u2019m sure we deliver on our promise for superior protection and service of the lowest possible cost. Continue to enhance the year experience, identifying and adopting new sources of revenue, improving, replacing and expanding our business platforms and uses of data and preparing for the challenges, but the future holds for our workforce and our agents, all areas we know present great opportunity. We continue our work in all of these spaces collectively and we are very pleased with our ongoing progress. Our efforts to foster easy doing business coupled with time saving efficiency and new coverage options are receiving high marks from our agents and our customer. In the third quarter, we\u2019ve further expanded our commercial online quote and application system \u2013 greater functionality in our business insurance. This upgrade allows agents to quote a complete commercial account in real time by reducing the time it takes to get a quote from 2 days to 10 minutes. And, we intentionally align the introduction of two new business classes in our custom collections products simultaneously with this new functionality. This month we had a contractors and manufacturer industry, all for natural fit as we have experienced many years of profitability from these business classes. And, now our agents can quote these products with greater efficiency. Additional improvements are evident in our new claims platform. You may recall that over the last two years, we introduce ERIE claim center with functionality for worker\u2019s compensation and personal auto, to set time we\u2019ve incrementally added functionality for additional lines of business and in just a few days a final release will be complete for all lines of business. As we think about our products offerings and reflect on the evolving picture of customer needs. We are identifying new innovative coverage option that best build those needs. We continue to develop and test products emerging from the shared economy for example. I talked about what we are doing for our agents and our customers, but I will be remised if I didn\u2019t mention our committed to employees, they are the heartbeat of this company and it\u2019s our responsibility to provide them with the tool they need to succeed. We are taking a thoughtful look at the workforce of the future and engaging employees and agent in the conversation. The survey participation and internal workgroup session, they\u2019re helping us proactively assess the workforce of the future, the workplace of the future, and the future of work. This assessment and the ensuing program will ensure that we\u2019re well position to meet the needs of all stakeholders in a contemporary way. Before I end my remarks, let me acknowledge some recent recognition we received from J.D. Power and Associates. Thanks to the dedication of our team, here it remains in high satisfaction peer in the 2017 small commercial insurance study and it\u2019s the highest rent insurer \u2013 renter\u2019s insurance segment of 2017 home insurance study. And, just this week, J.D. power released the result of the 2017 auto claim satisfaction study. J.D. once again scored well above the industry average finishing third industry wide. We are very happy to earn these distinctions. We were also recently recognized for a leadership and engagement around diversity and inclusion. ERIE was among the top 25 companies recognized for the efforts of our employee resource groups and our diversity counsel. Our strong team approach robust in greater inclusiveness in our workplace has been very affective and providing us a variety of perspective that makes good business sense. We are both encouraged by and very grateful for the recognition we received from third-party, but we are not complacent. We recognized the need for additional investment and we remain committed the necessary technology improvements, data investment, and product update that we\u2019ll keep theory the insurer of choice for our agents and customer, the employer of choice for our employee and the long-term investment of choice for you are shareholders. Thank you for your time this morning. And, now we would be happy to take your question. Operator : Scott Beilharz : Okay, Glenda, if there are no questions, I want to thank everyone for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsuramce.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time today. If you do have any questions, please call me at 814-870-7312. Thank you. Tim NeCastro : Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program and you may now disconnect.

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thank you, Scott. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 2017 was another very good year for Erie Indemnity. As we reported yesterday net income was $197 million resulting in earnings per share of $3.76 for the year, that's a decline from last year, but not unexpected. The enactment of the new tax law reduced earnings by $10 million or $0.19 per share beginning in 2018 our earnings will benefit from the lower tax rates. Greg will speak more to that in a few minutes. Our margins remain strong at 17%. We\u2019re pleased with that result especially as we continue to invest in infrastructure improvements that will keep us current and imperative in the market. Now let\u2019s turn to the 2017 results for the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Those results were also quite strong. We saw a 6% increase in direct and assumed written premium, and last year marked the 10th straight year that we surpass Conning's industry forecast which is currently 4.8%. In addition to premium growth our market share continues to increase in every state in our footprint based on results through the third quarter. The relatively mild weather across our states and our underwriting diligence yielded profitable results. A key profitability metric for the Exchange, the combined ratio, finished very strong in 2017. Our reported combined ratio was 96.2% for the year. We are fortunate that our operating territories escaped significant impact from the hurricanes and wildfires that affected much of the industry last year. You may recall, we had a Christmas snowstorm here in Erie, Pennsylvania that made national and even international news. While the local snowball was record-breaking, the storm had minimal impact on our 2017 losses. Our claim service during this holiday storm showed why people trust Erie. We had cap adjusters and property re-inspectors on the ground engaged and ready to support our customers in their time of need. The Exchange continues to perform well as a low-cost insurance provider offering great products and exceptional customer service. And because of its financial strength and solid reputation we were able to take a balanced approach of pricing, process enhancements, new product offerings and infrastructure improvements that were radius for future growth and success. In 2017 we deliver our largest platform replacement in recent years with the final release of our new claims management system, Erie claim center. By year end we process more than a half-million claims in the new system. And we reach a significant milestone last month with the retirement of our legacy claim system. With Erie claim center, we have improved our first notice of loss process for customers and agents. We know from JD Power\u2019s customer studies that are better claims experience starts with an agent. To that end we delivered improved capability to our agents for better loss reporting, status reporting and service throughout the entire claims experience. The success for the Erie claim center adds to our confidence as we make improvements of various size and scale to other platforms. Last year for instance we added quote and endorsement functionality for personal and commercial online systems. These updates are making it faster and easier for our agents to submit business and the service policies. These enhanced capabilities are translating into more rapid growth in many lines of business as we transition from quoting on legacy platforms. With greater automation employees can apply their skills to high-value work. So underwriters for instance can focus on more on the risk that require their knowledge and expertise. In addition to our platform and process improvements, we strive to offer new and emerging coverages. That's true in the shared economy space with products like ridesharing and home sharing coverages, in a mechanical and electronic breakdown microelectronic and cloud computing coverage or the business-class needs with our custom collection suite offered to more and more business owners. We continue to challenge ourselves to raise the bar with our product portfolio. Late in 2017, Dionne Wallace Oakley was named Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Strategy recognizing her long-standing contribution to the executive team. Dionne has been part of our Erie family for the past seven years serving as Senior Vice President of Human Resources and most recently as interim leader of our marketing division. Last year, we also restructured many of our business areas to better align with our strategic focus. As a reminder we identified four broad areas of opportunity enhancing the area experience, creating new sources of revenue, improving our platforms and data capability and preparing the workforce of the future. With the restructuring in place our leaders are making progress in planning and continuing work around these accelerators. Now I\u2019ll turn things over to Greg to report on our results. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim, and Good morning. Before I report on our results, I\u2019ll comment briefly on the impact of the newly enacted Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our results. As Tim mentioned, enactment of the new tax law resulted in a reduction in net income of $10 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and fully results, compared to the same period in 2016. We\u2019ve recorded a one-time non-cash tax expense of $20 million which resulted from the re-measurement of the net deferred tax asset at the newly enacted corporate income tax rate of 21%. This was partially offset by the recognition of a current tax benefit of $10 million related to the acceleration of pension contributions. Beginning in 2018, we expect our effective corporate income tax rate to decline to approximately 21% from approximately 34% as a result of the new tax legislation. Starting with our fourth quarter results, net income was $32 million or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to $46 million or $0.87 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating revenue in the quarter was $401 million, up 5.7% over the $380 million we reported for the fourth quarter of 2016, and reflecting continued market share growth. Operating expenses increased $20 million or 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Commissions increased $10 million or 4.7% and non-commissioned expenses increased $10 million or 9.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Increased information technology costs and increase personnel costs were the primary drivers of the increase in non-commissioned expenses. Indemnity\u2019s gross margin for the fourth quarter 2017 was 14.4% compared to 14.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Investment income decreased by $6.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. You\u2019ll recall that we had limited partnership earnings of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the year was $197 million or $3.76 per diluted share, compared to $210 million or $4.01 per diluted share in 2016. Operating revenue was up 6% to $1.7 million compared to $1.6 billion for 2016, that growth reflects a 6% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange as both policies enforce and average premium per policy experienced continued growth. Operating expenses in 2017 increased $99 million or 7.6% compared to 2016. Commissions increased $54 million or 6% in 2017 compared to 2016, the increase was driven by the increase in the direct and assumed premiums written in the exchange. Non-commissioned expenses increase $45 million or 11.1% compared to 2016 driven by the increase costs in underwriting and policy processing, information technology, customer service and administrative costs. As you can see we are continuing to invest in our platforms and data capabilities. With that in mind, we are pleased with our strong operating margins. The gross margin for 2017 with 17% compared to 18.3% for 2016. Investment income in 2017 was up slightly to $29 million compared to $28 million in 2016. Once again income for limited partnerships was significantly lower in 2017 compared to 2016. Finally our strong balance sheet has allowed us to pay our shareholders dividend in the amount of $146 million in 2017, and in December of last year our board voted to increase the annual dividend rate by 7.3% for 2018. Now, before I turn the call back over to Tim, I want to talk briefly about the new revenue recognition guidance we adopted effective January 1, 2018. Under the new guidance a small portion of the management fee will be allocated to Indemnity acting as the attorney-in-fact for all claims handling and investment management services for the Exchange. Under the previous guidance, all of the management fee was allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services. The revenue allocated to the claims handling and investment management services will be recognized over the typical claim settlement period. Additionally, under the new guidance the claims handling and investment management expenses and related reimbursements will be reporting gross on the income statement. Previously these expenses and related reimbursement were presented net on the financial statements. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial condition earnings or earnings per share and it will have no impact on our cash flows.  And now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. We measure our success impart by the positive response of our agents and customers, the increased engagement of our employees and the third-party recognition for our performance as a top-tier service provider. In 2017 Erie rank highest among auto insurers in most satisfying purchase experience in the JD Power and Associates Insurance shopping study and highest in the Renters Insurance segment of their U.S. Home insurance study. And just yesterday we learned that we ranked third in their 2018 claims satisfaction study. Our strong performance is a direct result of the skill, capability and dedication of our exceptional employees and our unrivaled agency force. I want to personally thank them for their outstanding work and contributions. Together with our financial results these accolades affirm that Erie is strong and well positioned for continued success. For 2018, we will continue to invest in increased capability and to explore new sources of revenue. Thank you for your time this morning. And now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Katelyn Young with William Blair. Your line is now open. Katelyn Young : Hi. Good morning. Tim NeCastro : Good morning. Katelyn Young : Couple of questions for you guys. First of all, in the light of the technology and ongoing infrastructure improvements being made, do you see 2017 is a good run rate for non-commission expenses relative to revenues? Or is there incremental investments that will be see in 2018? And with any incremental investment be at a rate that similar to 2017 or more or less? Greg Gutting : We don\u2019t really give forward-looking advice, but we are executing at a high level I\u2019d say on the IT front and in other fronts, so we will continue to see some decent investment there. Tim NeCastro : Katelyn, I\u2019ll add to that. There\u2019s a practical capacity for our spending and well, I can't tell you that the numbers are going to be exactly as they look going forward. We wouldn't provide that kind of guidance. We have accelerated our spending particular in the development arena over the past several years and we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments. Katelyn Young : Great. Thank you. And then just given the movement over the last couple of quarters and premiums written on the workers comp side, I appreciate that it is small. But can you just give any comment on rate trends or anything that you\u2019re seeing in that space? Greg Gutting : Yes. The actually policy counts are increasing at a decent rate, but the average premium is coming down and that\u2019s a function of the unbelievable performance that we\u2019re seeing as well as the industry seeing. Katelyn Young : Make sense. And then anything that helps us in the other markets that was pretty consistent across the board? Greg Gutting : Yes. I don\u2019t know if there are any real outliers in that. Katelyn Young : Okay. Thank you very much. That\u2019s all I had. Tim NeCastro : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. I\u2019m not showing any further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Scott Beilharz for any closing remarks. Scott Beilharz : Thanks, Grace. And thanks again for joining us. A recording of this call will be posted on our website erieinsuramce.com after 12 :30 PM Eastern Time. If you have any questions, please call me at 814-870-7312. Thank you. Tim NeCastro : Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

I'd like to introduce your host for today's call, Scott Beilharz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Bruce, and welcome, everyone.

On Tuesday we held our annual meeting with shareholders here at our home office in Erie, Pennsylvania, just days after the 93rd anniversary of Erie starting the auto insurance business. The positive energy and feedback at the shareholder meeting made it clear to me that the ongoing efforts of our dedicated employees and exceptional agents are paying up. Erie has built an enviable reputation for performance in the industry and our first quarter results for 2018 confirm that we are well positioned for continued success. In the first three months of this year, we recorded outstanding growth of 7% in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange. With that result Erie is again outpacing industry growth rates. Additionally at the end of the quarter, policyholder surplus is a robust $8.8 billion. Our strong surplus levels support our competitive position and ensure that we can service our customers needs handling everything from the smallest fender bender to major storms like the challenging weather events we experienced in the first quarter. Winter snowstorms in the first three months of 2018, including multiple nor'easter events in March played a significant role in our results. The reported combined ratio for the property casualty group was 105.6 in the quarter and that's over a 5% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2017. In true Erie fashion, our dedicated claims employees, catastrophe adjusters and agents responded to over 27,000 storm related claims throughout our footprint in the first three months of this year. Over 150 additional claims handlers were brought in to assist local teams in managing the heavy volume. Our claims team and our agents responded quickly and with care and I'd like to publicly thank them for their efforts. They truly exemplify our motto to be above all in service. Now, before I turn the call over to Greg for the details around our financial results, I\u2019d like to share some changes to our Board of Directors. First, I'd like to recognize recently retired board member Richard Stover who has contributions to Erie over the past eight years. Dick joined our board in 2010 serving on a number of committees during his tenure including the audit, executive and strategy committees. He also led the investment committee as Chair until the time of his retirement. We at Erie thank Dick for his years of service and wish him well. I'm also pleased to report that our shareholders elected a new director at Tuesday\u2019s Annual Meeting Salvatore Correnti. Sal was a director of builders insurance and of the Oil Casualty Investment Corporation. He is also an adjunct professor at Towson University in Maryland. He previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Conning Holdings, Conning Asset Management and was Non-Executive Vice Chair of the Board of Conning Holdings Corporation. Givens Sal\u2019s extensive experience in investments Sal has been appointed to serve as Chairman of our Investment Committee. Welcome to the board Sal. And, now I'll turn the call over to Greg. Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $66 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to $48 million or $0.91 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income increased $10.6 million or 15.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 as the growth in total operating revenue outpaced the growth in total operating expenses. I\u2019ll remind you that beginning January 01, of this year we adopted new FASB guidance on revenue recognition. Under the new guidance, a small portion of the management fee is allocated to Indemnity acting as the attorney-in-fact with respect to all claims handling and Investment Management Services for the exchange, which we collectively refer to as administrative services. Under the previous guidance, all of the management fee was allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services. The revenue allocated to the Administrative Services is recognized over the typical claim settlement period. Additionally, under the new guidance the administrative services expenses and related reimbursements are reported gross on the income statement. Previously, these expenses and related reimbursements were presented net on the financial statements. As you saw on our first quarter financials, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, earnings or earnings per share and had no impact on our cash flows. The new revenue recognition guidance caused an increase in both total operating revenue and total operating expenses of $146 million but had minimal impact on our operating income. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $14 million or 3.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. While management fee revenue allocated to administrative services was $13 million for the first quarter of 2018. No management fee revenue was allocated to administrative services in the first quarter of 2017. As Tim just mentioned, the Exchange\u2019s top line continues to grow at a rate outpacing industry forecasts. For the first quarter 2018 growth in management fee revenue was driven by the 7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange as both policies in force and average premium per policy increased year-over-year. Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 4.9% in the fist quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Agent commissions increased $13.6 million driven by the 7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange. In non-commission expenses increased $2.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period in 2017 driven by increases in underwriting and policy processing costs. Additionally, personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by special bonuses of approximately $4.8 million paid to employees in the quarter. Income from investments before taxes totaled $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was driven by net realized losses on investments during the first quarter of this year, compared to net realized gains in 2017. Finally, the enactment of the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to the lower tax rate of 21%. And as our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital management continues to create value for our shareholders we paid $39 million in dividends in the first quarter of 2018. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate that we continue to deliver value for our shareholders in 2018. As Greg pointed out, we realized a significant tax benefit in the first quarter from the enactment of the new Federal Tax Law. Our executive council decided to share some of that benefit with our employees in a way that helps them now and invests in their future. Last month, we paid a cash bonus to our full and part-time employees. And in May, we'll be making a retirement contribution to them as well. Our employees drive our success and it's their commitment and effort that helps maintain a strong and valued service reputation. As we move forward into the year, we know that new and improved products and platforms, customer service capabilities and evolving workforce needs will play a critical roles in the future of our business. That's why we continue to look at these areas of focus closely. We're especially excited about our recent partnership with Roost Telematics. Last month, we expanded our initial pilot further throughout our footprint. Our pilot involves Smart Home sensors that can help prevent disaster or mitigate damages by detecting a leak in the basement or severe temperature changes that can lead to frozen pipes and more extensive damage. We're also beginning to pilot the use of telematics for youthful drivers by tracking driver behavior throughout the use or through the use of a smartphone app will monitor behavior and reward teens for safe driving habits and avoiding dangerous activities such as texting while behind the wheel. These are just two examples of the kind of innovative approaches we are taking to deliver value to our customers while meeting their evolving needs. Additionally, we will continue to build on existing product offerings. Later this year, we\u2019ll expand our successful custom collection suite of commercial products bringing tailored coverages to the growing market of breweries, wineries and distilleries. We continue to invest in infrastructure, strengthening our platforms and data capabilities and equip employees and agents with more contemporary and efficient tools allowing greater focus on customer service and providing with a human touch that Erie is known for. One of the most visible investments is in our commercial online quote and application system to bring greater functionality to our agents. Agents use the system now to quote workers' compensation, commercial auto and our commercial package policy. Our business umbrella policy will be added to the platform this year supporting agent\u2019s ability to write a comprehensive suite of commercial products with a single data entry. As we think about our future workforce, we are looking at the work of our own employees, as well as the challenges our agents face in building their teams. We're committed to helping our agent partners identify their upcoming needs and support their efforts as they too prepare for a changing marketplace. Our strong reputation for customer satisfaction is affirmed time and again by J.D. Power. Earlier this month, the firm released the results of its 2018 Property Claims Satisfaction Study. Erie ranked third in the highest satisfaction category achieving best-in-class scores for two of the top five factors. We also learned this week that we took first place in J.D. Power\u2019s auto insurance purchase experience. This is the sixth consecutive year that Erie has finished first in the study of the insurance shopping experience. These results are a testament to the consistent superior service of Erie employees and agents. And while we're very pleased with these third-party recognitions, we also see them as learning opportunities. What are we doing right and how can we do it even better. As leaders, employees and agents we continue to push ourselves to answer and deliver on these questions, this solid work ethic is just one more aspect of the commitment among the Erie family that makes us successful day-after-day and year-after-year. And now if there are any questions we're happy to take them. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no questions.  : : Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Bruce. A recording of today\u2019s call will be posted on our website, erieinsurance.com. Thank you for joining us today and have a great day. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, everybody.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Erie Indemnity had a strong first half of the year. In our second quarter 10-Q filed yesterday, we reported net income of $145 million or $2.78 per share for the first six months of 2018. We're very pleased with these results and confident in our direction for the months ahead. Before Greg gets further into the financial details, I'd like to share a few highlights for the Exchange, the insurance operation we manage. For the past decade, premium growth has outpaced the industry, an accomplishment the Exchange is on track to repeat in 2018. Direct and assumed premiums grew almost 7% in the first half of 2018 compared to 2017. For comparison, Conning's industry forecast for this year is a 4.9% growth. Policyholder surplus is up slightly for the year to $8.8 million, reflecting Erie's healthy operational and financial position. That increase comes at the same time we've responded to increased storm activity across much of our territory. Second quarter storms were frequent, but smaller in scale compared to the winter storms we saw in the first three months of the year. The reported combined ratio for the Property and Casualty Group was 103.4 for the second quarter, down slightly from the 105.6 reported for the first three months of this year. Our year-to-date result is 104.25 compared to 98.2 at mid-year 2017. Our employees and agents stepped up to meet the needs of our customers and communities in the aftermath of snow, wind and hail storms. Our team of dedicated cat adjusters joined local claims employees to make sure that we had people on the ground needed to expedite claims handling with the human touch that is so critical to our customers in our customers' time of need. I'd like to thank the team, our employees and agents for their efforts and dedication throughout these past few months. The work they do brings care and compassion to the recovery process, making a huge difference to our customers. We're also continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives to strengthen our ability to compete now and into the future. I'll talk more about the progress we're making in a few minutes. But now, I'll turn it over to Greg. Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with the financial results we are seeing this year. They reflect the dedicated service of our agents and our employees as well as our commitment to deliver on our strategy. Starting with the second quarter of 2018, net income was $80 million or $1.52 per diluted share compared to $59 million or $1.12 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. For the first six months of 2018, net income was $145 million or $2.78 per diluted share compared to $106 million or $2.03 per diluted share in the first half of 2017. Total operating revenue outpaced the growth in total operating expenses in both the second quarter and the first six months of 2017, resulting in an increase in the operating income of 14.2% or $12 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, and an increase in operating income of 15% or $23 million in the first six months of this year compared to the first six months of last year. The Exchange's premium growth continues to outpace the industry. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $13 million in the second quarter and $27 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, driven by the increases in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange as both policies in force and average premium per policy increased in both periods. Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 4% in the second quarter and 4.4% in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. Commissions increased $10 million in the second quarter and $24 million in the first half of 2018 compared to 2017 driven by the increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, slightly offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth. Non-commission expenses in the second quarter increased $4 million compared to last year driven by the increases in underwriting and policy processing costs, customer service costs and administrative costs. In the first six months of 2018, non-commission expenses increased $7 million compared to the same period in 2017, driven by increases in underwriting and policy processing costs and customer service costs. Information technology costs decreased slightly in the first half of 2018 compared to last year, but keep in mind these costs will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as we will continue to invest in this area. The total investment income decreased $200,000 in the second quarter of 2018 and $700,000 in the first half of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. The decreases were primarily driven by net realized losses and impairments on investment. Finally, Indemnity's income tax expense decreased just over $ 9 million in the second quarter and $17 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to 2017 due to the lower income tax rate of 21%, which became effective January 1st of this year. We take a measured approach to capital management and diligently maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first six months of 2018, our strong performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders dividends in the amount of $78 million. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. Our continued strong results provide a solid backdrop for our investments in the future. On past calls, I talked about our areas of focus; four areas where we're directing resources to sustain and accelerate Erie's success in a changing market. These areas include : enhancing the Erie experience, improving strategic platforms and data management, exploring new sources of revenue and preparing the workforce for the future. We continue to make progress across all fronts. Let me call out a few significant steps we've taken in these past three months. After 25 years in service, our former claims management system is fully retired. We're not completely operational with ERIE ClaimCenter, a system we began to deploy in late 2015. ERIE ClaimCenter was our first major strategic investment in improving platforms and data and it has already enabled us to successfully handle over $1 million claims. For our agents, who continue to expand the capabilities of our online commercial quote and application system, the most recent edition is the ability to write a business development policy with a new account, a move that also supports our efforts to drive more same-store sales, while improving protection for our customers. We are seeing strong growth in our commercial businesses that directly linked -- that is directly linked to our agents' ability to write more with Erie faster and easier. Premium and commercial lines is up almost 7% fueled by strong retention and new premium growth is up nearly 13%. Last quarter, I shared with you plans for piloting new smart home technology and a telematics program for youthful drivers. Both are underway and early results are promising. Since March, customers have stalled nearly 400 Roost sensors in their homes. The sensors are about the size of deck of playing cards and they can detect a water leak or severe temperature changes and notify homeowners through a smartphone app. Installed devices have protected leaks enabling homeowners to stop a potentially costly problem or damage or losses occurred. Additionally, we launched our telematics pilot in Ohio and West Virginia. At 45 days in, more than 2,000 customers have registered for this smartphone app, even encouraging safer driving behaviors among our youthful motorists. Erie continues to gain recognition from highly respected third-party firms. Let me share some of our recent accomplishments. I'm very pleased to say that Erie ranked first in the Midwest Atlantic region in J.D. Power's 2018 U.S. Auto Insurance Study. This honor marks the fourth time Erie has won in this region over the past six years. Erie also earned a second award from J.D. Power this year, winning top honors from the firm's Annual Auto Insurance Shopping Study for the sixth consecutive year. Erie now boasts 22 awards from J.D. Power, the most that any agency represent a company. In addition to recognition from J.D. Power, A.M. Best has affirmed our financial strength rating of A+ Superior for the Property and Casualty Group, and the A Excellent rating for the Erie Family Life. Erie Insurance Exchange is one of just 67 companies to retain at least an A rating for 75 or more years. Erie has 79 consecutive years and counting. Erie's A.M. Best rating reflects a healthy balance sheet as well as strong operating performance, favorable business profile and an appropriate enterprise risk management. Just 12% of U.S. property-casualty insurers earned the A+ rating. Finally, last week, Erie Insurance Group was named towards 50 top-performing property-casualty insurers for 2018. It's Erie's 18th appearance on the list since 1981. These honors reflect the deep commitment and work for more than 5,500 employees and nearly 2,200 agencies, along with the firm foundation on which Erie was built. Before I end my comments today, I want to recognize Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Sean McLaughlin. This week, Sean shared his decision to retire from Erie at the end of 2018. Sean is an Erie Pennsylvanian and graduate of Georgetown University and Georgetown University Law Center. He joined our organization in August 2013 following a distinguished carrier on the federal bench. He served nearly 20 years as Federal District Court judge and completed his tenure on the court as Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania before assuming the role of Erie's General Counsel. We're deeply grateful for the legal acumen and wisdom Sean has shared as part of the Erie's executive team over the past five years. His early notice allows us time for a thoughtful search in transition and we'll begin that process immediately. Thank you, Sean. We appreciate your participation in today's call. And now, I'll turn it back over to Scott. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, Tim., and thank you, everyone, for tuning in today. A recording of this call will be posted on our website, erieinsurance.com. Once again, please direct any questions regarding our second quarter 2018 results to me at (814) 870-7312. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, everybody.

This call was pre-recorded and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. And now I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this pre-recorded discussion about our 2018 third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions, subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause these differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC, dated October 25, 2018, and in the related press release. This pre-recorded call is a property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we'll move on Tim's remarks. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks Scott, and thanks to everyone for taking the time to learn more about Erie's performance through the third quarter. I'm pleased to share that we're continuing the pace we set during the first half of the year resulting in another strong quarter for Indemnity. As you saw on our third quarter 10-Q filed yesterday, we reported net income of $80 million or a $1.54 per share for the quarter. We're very pleased with these earnings results. For context, I\u2019d like to share a few bright spots from the exchange the insurance operations we manage. Then Greg will follow with more of the details around the Indemnity's third quarter results. We reached a significant milestone during the third quarter achieving $7 billion in total direct written premium over the rolling 12 month period. That $7 billion reflects $5 billion in premiums from personal lines and nearly $2 billion from commercial. We've had strong PNC premium growth over the past decade, growth which has outpaced the industry in each of the last 10 years. We nearly doubled personal lines premium over the past nine years with growth largely from our existing agents. Average premium per agency has claimed more than 60% since 2009, and 1.9 million to 3.1 million. In commercial, we brought an additional $1 billion in premiums in the last five years alone. It's a result driven by our continued effort to bolster our agent's knowledge, skills and capabilities to meet the needs of small to mid-size businesses. We've also grown policyholder surplus which reached $9 billion in the third quarter. That result reflects Erie's healthy operational and financial position and our ability to be there for the customers who place their trust in us. While increased storm activity continued during the third quarter including impact from Hurricane Florence, the effect on our territories was modest compared to expectations. Similarly, while Hurricane Michael heavily affected parts of Florida and other coastal states, our claims impact was again less than anticipated. Our reported combined ratio through the third quarter was 102.1 year-to-date compared to 95.6 year-to-date at September 30, 2017. The higher combined ratio this year reflects the impact of multiple events none of them individually significant. This is very much a business where we're always prepare for the worst or hoping for the best. With our claims teams and agents mobilized for all hands response, we responded to nearly 6000 claims following Florence. That preparation made a noticeable difference in the communities that suffered the brunt of storm damage last month. I like to share this comment from one our agents in North Carolina. He said, Erie's response during Florence has been and continues to be nothing short of amazing. The leadership in response to the claims and branch team has so far - anything even close to what my other carriers have done. We are very proud of the dedication and caring our claims team and agents bringing to every claim of them. We care deeply about the communities in the Erie footprint and to that end we donated to the American Red Cross to aid those areas harmed by Hurricane Florence. Regardless of the season what the weather brings, we're driven by promise to be there. For our customers, our agents, our communities to serve them on the near as most. I'm going to turn it over to Greg and then I'll talk more about progress for making on key initiatives in a few minutes. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks Tim. As Tim mentioned we are very pleased with the financial results we are seeing this year. They reflect a dedicated service of our agents and our employees, as well as our commitment to deliver on our strategy. Starting with the third quarter of 2018, net income was $80 million or a $1.54 per diluted share compared to $59 million or a $1.12 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. For the first nine months of 2018, net income was $226 million or $4.32 per diluted share compared to $165 million or $3.15 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2017. Total operating revenue outpace the growth in total operating expenses in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2017 resulting in an increase in operating income of $15 million or 19% in the third quarter 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 and an increase in operating income of 16% or $38 million for the first nine months of this year compared to the first nine months of last year. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $16 million in the third quarter and $43 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 driven by an increase in direct premiums written and assumed by the exchange of 7%. Increases in both policies in force and average premium for policy contributed to the growth direct written premiums. Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 3.9% in the third quarter and 4.2% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. Commissions increased $8 million in the third quarter and $32 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in commissions was driven by a 7% increase in the direct and assume premiums written by the exchange while slightly offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth. Non- commission expenses in the third quarter increased $6 million compared to last year driven mainly by increases in information technology cost of $4 million and administrative and other expenses of $2 million. In the first nine months of 2018, non-commission expenses increased $13 million compared to the same period in 2017 driven by increases in information technology, underwriting and policy processing costs, and customer service cost. Personnel costs for the first nine months of 2018 were impacted by additional bonuses of approximately $4.8 million awarded to all employees as a result of tax savings realized from the lower corporate income tax rate that became effective January 1 of 2018. These increase personnel costs were somewhat offset by lower estimated cost for incentive plan awards related to underwriting performance. Total investment income remained flat for both third quarter and the first nine months of 2018. Finally, Indemnity's income tax expense decreased just over $6 million in the third quarter and $23 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower income tax rate of 21% which became effective January 1 of this year. For the first nine months of 2018, our strong performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders' dividends in the amount of the $117 million. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks Greg. Clearly we remain in the position of strength for continued profitable growth and for continued investment in our future success. That investment is taking shape across the four areas of focus I talked about on past calls and where we\u2019re relying resources to sustain and accelerate Erie's success in the changing market. These areas include continuing to enhance the Erie's experience, improving our platforms and data management, exploring new sources of revenue, and preparing the workforce for the future. We\u2019re making good progress on all four areas of focus and I\u2019d like to share a few highlights from the latest quarter. We recently delivered new products to help our agents better meet protection needs of our customers, and attract new business. In commercial lines, we expanded our successful custom collection to include program designed for the growing market of wineries, breweries and distilleries. Custom collection continues to drive strong growth with 55% of all commercial premium now coming from custom collection classes. Agents also began offering an enhanced coverage option for business model policies and a new endorsement here towards smaller corporations within a business owner. With our licensed agents, we're now offering Medicare supplement insurance to help our customers pay some of the hospital and Medicare costs not covered by Medicare. This coverage is available in most states through the exchanges wise subsidiary Erie's Family Life. Medicare supplement provides both a new revenue opportunity and needs to more fully meet the protection needs of our customers. In personal lines, we reached a key milestone wrapping up a three-year project at our homeowners lines. We now have the functionality for agents to be able to endorse Erie secure home policies using DSpro Web, the web-based system our agents use for quoting and writing new personal lines business. We're currently piloting this group of agents in Tennessee and Pennsylvania with the expectation of the complete rollout of the third quarter of next year. These kind of achievements are part of the steady drumbeat of enhancements that support the business our agents continue to bring in the order. We\u2019re also moving ahead on new initiatives at telematics pilot to began earlier this year. I've talked about this program on prior calls. It's a program aimed at encouraging safer driving among the younger motorists. We are getting ready to expand this program. To-date more than 5000 drivers have registered for the smartphone app in our pilot states of Ohio and West Virginia. From early results, we're seeing the customers who choose to register have better loss ratios than others. Next year we\u2019ll extend the program called YourTurn to our entire footprint sending approval from state insurance departments. YourTurn will strengthen our ability to compete in the youthful driver market in a way that is profitable and sustainable long-term or helping to encourage safer driving. Before we wrap up this recording, I\u2019d like to share some recent recognition Erie earned from two national organizations for our commitments to employee health and wellness. First, Erie received a gold level recognition in the American Heart Association's 2018 Workplace Health Achievement Index. More than 1000 companies participate in the index which also provides a benchmark for health and wellness initiatives. Erie has received the index's highest recognition each year since 2013. Second, Erie earned a gold award in the National Business Group on health 2018 Best Employers for Healthy Lifestyles program. This honor is the second highest presented by the national business group recognizes an organization's commitment to holistic well-being and related metrics. Erie has received either a platinum, gold or silver award from the group each year since 2009. Preparing our workforce for the future is an area of focus that very much involves our employees today. We take care of our employees and they in turn appreciate our value proposition. That's why it's so important that we offer employees a competitive total rewards package with benefits to help them and their families enjoy healthier, more secure lives. We're proud of honors like these that validate our efforts and we know the importance of looking at new emerging opportunities for our workforce today and in the future. Thank you for your time today. We appreciate your support and your interest in Erie. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to our Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz at area code 814-870-7312. Thank you and have a great day. Q -:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call was pre-recorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations. Scott Beilharz. Please go ahead. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2018 fourth quarter and full-year results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the Company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the Safe Harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC dated February 21, 2019, and in the related press release. This pre-recorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we move on to Tim's remarks. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to everyone for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and our year-end results. Last year was another strong year for Erie Company. As you saw in our press release filed yesterday, we reported net income of $62 million or $1.19 per diluted share for the quarter, that's $30 million more than the fourth quarter of 2017. Greg, will talk more about the drivers of that increase in a few minutes. But before we get into more detail around Indemnity's results, I'd like to share some highlights from the year for Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operation we manage. The results of the Indemnity reflect the success of the Exchange. 2018 was another year of robust growth in our property/casualty business. In 2018, the Exchange grew property/casualty premiums 7% over the prior year to more than $7 billion. This result exceeds Conning's latest industry growth forecast of 5.6% for the year. Our 2018 premium growth marks the 11th straight year that Erie run faster than the industry, while making steady gains in market share across our territory. Our property/casualty results reflect the solid combination and strong retention, higher average premium per policy and growth in new business. In contrast to 2017, weather-related losses were bigger part of the Exchange's experience in 2018, while no single event stands out. Snow, wind and hail losses market in many of our territories with greater frequency throughout the year. The combined ratio of 103.1% reflects these storms. For comparison, the Exchange recorded a combined ratio of 96.2% a year ago, following a stretch relatively mild weather across our territory. Severe weather is never welcome, but at Erie it's an opportunity to demonstrate our value to our agents, our customers and the communities that rely on us. I'm proud to say that we did just that in our response to 71,000 weather-related claims in 2018. Compassionate service is essential in our business and so is the strong financial foundation. We'll position to deliver on both fronts just as we did last year. The Exchange ended the year with policyholder surplus $8.6 billion, 2.3% below 2017's $8.8 billion. The slight decrease reflects the increased level of storm claims and a down investment year. It also follows a year of significant gains in the surplus, in 2017 when surplus grew by over $1 billion. Erie's operational and financial position remained healthy. I want to thank our employees and agents for their commitment and hard work this past year. We delivered on our promise to service at every turn, while continuing to grow premium and make solid progress on our strategic ventures. I'll talk more about that progress in a few moments following Greg's review of the financials. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks Tim. As Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with Indemnity's financial results for 2018. They reflect the dedicated service of our agents and our employees, as well as our commitment to deliver on our strategy. Starting with the fourth quarter of 2018, net income was $62 million or $1.19 per diluted share compared to $32 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. I think it's important at this time to remind everyone that the 2017 fourth quarter and full-year results were negatively impacted by the enactment of the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a result of the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets at the lower tax rate. This resulted in the reduction of 2017 fourth quarter and full-year net income of $10 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Operating income in the most recent quarter increased $16 million, up 27.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. While Management fee revenue from administrative services totaled $14 million in the quarter. Both amounts were driven by the 6.7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange in the fourth quarter. Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased $11 million compared to the same period in 2017. Commission expenses increased $4 million, as a result of the increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, somewhat offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth. Non-commission expenses increased $7 million in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $3 million, information technology costs increased just over $2 million, and customer service costs increased roughly $1 million. Total pre-tax investment income in the quarter was $5 million, down $2 million compared to the same period in 2017. Drivers of the decrease included net realized losses on investments and losses from limited partnerships. The losses were partially offset by increased net investment income. Turning to full-year 2018 results. Net income was $288 million or $5.51 per diluted share compared to $197 million or $3.76 per diluted share in 2017. The increase in earnings per share in 2018 was driven by the lower corporate income tax rate in 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a significant increase in operating income. Operating income before taxes increased $54 million or 18.6% in 2018 compared to 2017. Management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $57 million in 2018 compared to 2017, while management fee revenue from administrative services totaled $54 million in the year. Both amounts were driven by the 7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange. Commissions paid to our independent agents increased $36 million in 2018 compared to 2017, resulting from the increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, somewhat offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth. Non-commission expenses in 2018 increased nearly $20 million compared to 2017, increases of $8 million in underwriting and policy processing costs, $5 million in information technology costs, and just over $4 million in customer service costs were the primary drivers of the increase. Personnel costs in all categories were impacted by bonuses awarded to employees, as a result of savings realized from the lower corporate income tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017, as well as increased medical costs. Income from investments on a pre-tax basis totaled $26 million for the year compared to $29 million in 2017, while net investment income increased by nearly $6 million, a loss of $1 million in 2018 from our limited partnership portfolio compared to earnings of $3 million in 2017 combined with realized losses and impairment losses of $4 million resulted in the year-over-year reduction in total investment income. Finally, Indemnity's strong financial performance has allowed us to pay our shareholders $156 million in dividends during 2018. And in December of last year, our Board approved a 7.1% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for both Class A and Class B shares for 2019. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thanks Greg. We remain firmly in position for continued profitable growth and we continue to invest in areas that support our strategic direction. Throughout 2018, we engaged our teams on initiatives centered on four areas of strategic focus; strengthening our business platforms and uses of data, continuing to enhance the Erie experience, identifying and developing new sources of revenue, and preparing the workforce of the future. We further developed and detailed priorities in each area and continue to deliver new capabilities improving service levels, product offerings and the efficiency of our agents and employees. In terms of our platforms, our agents have new online capabilities for writing business with Erie and servicing customer needs. In commercial lines, for instance, we expanded agents' ability to cope more lines of business online and introduce functionality to drive more cross-selling and boost commercial revenue. We continue to see double-digit premium growth in commercial lines that are in large part attributable to this online system. In personal lines, we began the rollout of our online capabilities for servicing homeowners business. The rollout will be completed in 2019, marking a significant step for improved online capabilities for our agents' personal lines business with Erie. We also delivered new and enhanced products, including a second option for homeowners insurance that will further strengthen our competitive position. Within our Erie experience initiatives, we began to work necessary to expand our distinctive service culture, what we call the service model of the future. We're engaging our customers, our agents and policyholders throughout this effort to gain our insights and build an even stronger understanding of their experience and expectations. Their understanding is key as we worked with a couple of best digital capabilities with the human touch where it matters most. We've also extended pilot testing the capabilities of telematics for pricing private passenger auto insurance and expanding the use of home sensors to customers in most of our states. More than 3,000 young drivers are using telematics in our pilot states of Ohio and West Virginia. We're very pleased with the response and with the experience and we're looking to expand that program in 2019. We plan to be in two more states this summer and then deploy additional territories later in 2019. Since expanding the home sensor pilot, we've grown the program to more than 2,000 households. While we continue to dig into the data, customer feedback pulses with the program is making a difference. One customer in Ohio, for instance, reported that his sensor detected a refrigerator leak just two days after installation and helped them avoid a costly loss. Another customer in Pennsylvania credited the sensor for alarming him for water leak in his basement and allowing him to take steps to prevent damages. Examples like these reflect the improved proactive experienced customers can have with Erie, while also saving us and them the cost of the claim. The other operations we remain strongly engage through the rationalization of our hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. Being a good corporate citizen is important to us. So it's also good business. A vibrant downtown core will attract new businesses and people, helping us recruit and retain top talent at Erie. Late last year we announced investments in two start-up companies to help support their endeavors and also encouraged other innovators to consider Northwest Pennsylvania as an attractive base for setting up their operations. The Company's products are also relevant to our operations. The first investment is in SimpleSense, which has developed a sensor system that can aid emergency response by identifying if people are occupying a building and where they're located in that building and also identify the process route for the first responders to reach them. The other company, CityGrows, has created a cloud-based system to help local governments to manage, permitting, licensing and other processes online. We're looking forward to a productive partnership with both companies. This past year was also one of the heavy recognition from JD Power for customer satisfaction with Erie and our agents. In October, just three years after the launch of our new claims management system, Erie ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction in JD Power's 2018 US Auto Claims Satisfaction Study. This is Erie's first JD Power arm for auto claims handling and our 24th award since JD Power began studying our industry in 1999. It's an honor to reflect the deep commitment of our claims team to do the right thing for our customers and claimants, as well as our ability to do it even better today. Erie also earned top honors for customer satisfaction in the auto insurance purchase experience and in auto insurance in the Mid-Atlantic region. Those awards are some of the difference made by our agents and our customers experience from the time of purchase through renewal. Before we close, I'd like to recognize Sean McLaughlin, who retired from Erie at the end of 2018. Sean served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel for five years, following a 19-year career as a highly regarded Federal Judge. He is now practicing at the firm where he started has a lawyer in 1981. We wish Sean a very best and appreciate his service and contributions to Erie. Our financial results, the progress and direction on our strategy and the continued recognition from third parties, like JD Power, give us great confidence that Erie remains well equipped for success in the property/casualty market and in the hearts and minds of our customers, employees, agents, and you, our shareholders. Thank you for your time today. We appreciate your continued interest in Erie. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. Q -:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2019 first quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed, and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions, subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Timothy NeCastro : Thank Scott, and thanks to everyone for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the first quarter of 2019. We recently marked the 94th anniversary of Erie's start in the auto insurance business and just three days ago, held our annual meeting of shareholders at our home office in Erie, Pennsylvania. We had a good story to tell. 2018 was a strong year for Erie. We continue to grow premium, achieving a significant revenue milestone of direct written premium of $7 billion. We made progress across key initiatives, making a meaningful difference for our agents, customers and employees and in the communities where we do business. The story continued in the first quarter of 2019. As you saw in our press release filed yesterday, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $75 million or $1.44 per diluted share for the quarter. That's nearly $10 million more than the first quarter of 2018. Greg will talk about the drivers of that increase in a few minutes. Before we get into the detail around Indemnity's results, I'd like to share some recent highlights for Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operation we manage. In the first quarter, the exchange grew premium 6% over the prior year to almost $1.8 billion. This result exceeds Conning's latest industry forecast of 4.5% growth this year, and it follows 11 straight years that Erie's premium growth has outpaced the industry. Strong retention and an increase in average premium were both significant factors in recent premium growth. Renewal policies grew 4.2%, driving a 7% increase in renewal premium. At 102.2, Erie's combined ratio for the first quarter is down compared to 105.6 a year ago, reflecting fewer and less severe weather events at the start of the year. At the end of the first quarter, policyholder surplus was $9 billion compared to $8.6 billion at the end of 2018. In addition to the strong results of our combined operations, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives. I'll talk more about these recent achievements following Greg's review of the financials. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to share with you the results of another strong quarter for Erie Indemnity. But first, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on our 2019 annual shareholders meeting that was held on April 30. At the meeting, we were able to share the results of our strong performance for 2018 and some initiatives we have planned for 2019 that will help us continue to grow. We are proud of our 2018 results where the Exchange grew its direct and affiliated assumed premiums to over $7 billion, marking the 11th consecutive year of growth, and we delivered earnings per share of $5.51, which is the highest earnings per share in our company's history. While we are proud of our past performance, we remain focused on delivering another strong year of results in 2019. I believe the first quarter results speak to that focus. For the first quarter of 2019, net income was $75 million or $1.44 per diluted share compared to $66 million or $1.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. Operating income increased $8.6 million or 11% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 as the growth in total operating revenue outpaced the growth in total operating expenses. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $25 million or 6.2% to $431 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Management fee revenue from administrative services increased $1 million or 6.7% to $14 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year period. Turning to indemnity's cost of operations related to policy issuance and renewal services, commissions increased $9 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. This was a result of the 6% increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange, slightly offset by lower agent incentive costs. Noncommission expenses increased $8 million in the quarter compared to the same period in 2018. Information technology costs increased $5.5 million, primarily due to increased professional fees, while sales and advertising costs decreased $2 million, primarily due to decreased personnel costs and agent-related costs.  Administrative and other expenses increased $4.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in the long-term incentive plan costs. This increase was driven by the increase in the company's share price during the quarter compared to the same period in 2018. Personnel costs and all expense categories were lower in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 due to a special bonus awarded to all employees in the first quarter of 2018. Income from investments before taxes totaled $9.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net realized gains were $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net realized losses of $500,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Net investment income was $8.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. Once again, we are focused on delivering another strong year of performance. With that, I'll turn the call back to over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. Erie is well-positioned for sustained profitable growth and we continue to invest in areas that support our strategic direction. I've talked about these four areas in the past. They are the framework for how we're aligning our resources to sustain and accelerate Erie's success in a changing market. The four areas include strengthening our business platforms and use of data, continuing to enhance the Erie experience, identifying and developing new sources of revenue and preparing the workforce of the future. We're making progress in all of four areas. I'd like to share a few highlights from the first quarter. First, we introduced a new service that helps our customers recover faster following personal lines loss. Customers can choose to have an electronic claims payment delivered directly to their bank account in less than an hour. We partnered with PNC Bank and Visa on this service, making Erie one of just a handful of carriers offering e-payments for claims settlement. We believe that fast delivery of a claims payment is a valuable compliment to the caring service provided by our claims team. Secondly, in an additional effort to improve the experience of customers following a loss, we recently piloted a new service for drivers who need transportation from the scene of an auto accident. Our first notice of loss team provided these customers with a virtual debit card to cover temporary travel expenses, including public transportation, a taxicab or ridesharing service, such as Uber or Lyft. Feedback from the pilot was very positive and we're now preparing to expand this service. Claim reporting is a critical touch point in a customers experience, and it's a moment of truth for us, a moment where we can deliver on the promise of service that comes with every Erie policy. Finally, we continue efforts to enhance the interactions our customers, agents and employees have with Erie that leverages the power of digital, coupled with the human touch. It's an approach that is distinctly Erie. Key to this approach is ongoing engagement with our customers, agents and employees through focus groups and other forms. The goal is to make sure we have a strong understanding of their needs and expectations to align our decisions and actions. Since completing the transition to our new claims management system in early 2018, we've been able to provide agents greater access to information about claims, helping them provide faster, better service directly to customers. Our customer care team is using a new platform that they help design. This platform streamlines access to multiple systems so customer care employees can easily access the information they need to quickly help our agents and customers. These initiatives are ongoing and will continue to build on the direction and progress we've made in the months ahead. Now I'd like to turn to the recent recognition that we received. First, Erie was named one of the nation's best large employers for 2019 by Forbes Magazine. This was an honor for companies with 5,000 or more employees. We take great pride in being a major employer of choice and are especially excited about this recognition, which is based on employees' feedback and their experience. The second honor comes from J.D. Power and speaks to the efforts of our agents and employees to bring on new Erie customers. This award marks the seventh year in a row that Erie was recognized for highest customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's annual auto insurance shopping study. I want to publicly thank our agents and employees for all they do to make Erie successful with our customers and communities. This is a significant honor reflecting the work we do around our largest line of business. Before we close, I want to recognize Dr. Claude Lilly, III, who retired from Erie Indemnity's Board of Directors on April 30, and thank him for his service over the past 19 years. We have a great Board of Directors at Erie and Claude has brought valuable experience and insights to the team throughout his tenure. On behalf of all of us at Erie, I wish Claude the best. Our financial results, our direction and progress and the continued recognition from third parties like J.D. Power give us great confidence that Erie remains well-equipped for success and in the heart and minds of our customers, employees, agents and shareholders. Thank you for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Erie. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. End of Q&A:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2019 second quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed, and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions, subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the Safe Harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC, dated July 25, 2019, and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott and thank you everyone for your time today and interest in Erie\u2019s second quarter results. Erie Indemnity performed well over the past three months. As you saw in our press release filed yesterday, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $88 million or $1.68 per diluted share for the quarter that\u2019s over $8 million more in the second quarter in 2018. Greg will talk more about what\u2019s behind that increase. Before he does, I want to share recent highlights for Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operation we manage. In the second quarter, premiums grew 5.6% over the prior year to nearly $2 billion. Renewal premium is driving this growth as we continue to experience strong policy retention. The exchanges work continues to exceed Conning's latest industry forecast of 4.1%, this result puts Erie on pace to outperform the industry on premium growth for the 12th year in a row. As we\u2019ve shared on past calls, our long term growth goal is to outpace the industry and grow our market share. The gap between Erie\u2019s premium growth in the industry has slowed over the last two years driven by several factors. First are the market conditions. Prices are softening in private passenger automobile as carriers hold steady on rates or take decreases which [sharpens] shopping activity. Secondly at Erie, we\u2019re slowing down the private passenger auto growth that is not generating a profit. This is an intentional move to show up our competitive position and bolster our ability to provide a competitive rate for the very best risks. It's a move we believe is necessary to stay true to our commitment to steady growth and steady pricing. At the end of the second quarter, policyholder surplus was almost $9 billion compared to $8.6 billion at the end of 2018. The growth was driven by investment returns. Lastly, I want to share some context around our combined ratio. For the first half of 2019, the exchanges combined ratio totaled 110.3 compared to 104.5 a year ago. That increase reflects an extremely active spring storm season that affected much of our Midwest including parts of Erie\u2019s operating territory. One of the most significant events took place over Memorial Day when storms brought strong winds and hail to Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The Dayton Ohio area was hit hard by destructive tornadoes. In times like those, our employees and agents deliver in a big way for our customers. They're in our customers neighborhoods quickly typically before the representatives of other insurers to take care of immediate needs and start the process of recovery. I want to share with you a note we received from a customer in Dayton about her experience with her agent and our adjuster. Both individuals, she wrote are examples of why I've chosen Erie as my insurance provider. I can't thank them enough for providing me with a high level of comfort and confidence as I worked through the devastation of this tornado. I too want to thank our dedicated claims employees and our agents. Your care and commitment make a great difference to our customers and the communities we serve. Overall we're pleased with the results so far this year and our progress on strategic initiatives. I'll talk more about that in recent recognition for the Erie following Gregg's review of the financials. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks Tim. As Tim mentioned, it was a solid second quarter but this quarter successes go beyond traditional financial measures and can be seen in our award-winning customer service and customer experience. [Indiscernible] responding to catastrophic weather events like those experienced in May or expanding our availability to offer electronic claims payments, we continue to be above all in service. During the second quarter we continue to pilot new claims e-payment capabilities. Today I am proud to say that we have provided all of our auto and property claims adjusters with the ability to offer customers their settlement electronically through a Visa Direct and Zell. The initial feedback has been outstanding and we look forward to the continued satisfaction this capability will provide for our customers. Now I'd like to share with you Erie's financial results. Starting with the second quarter Erie's net income was $88 million or $1.68 per diluted share compared to $80 million or $1.52 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. For the first six months of 2019, net income was a $163 million or $3.12 per diluted share compared to $145 million or $2.78 per diluted share in the first half of 2018. Operating income increased 1.3% or $1 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018. And then we also saw an increase in operating income of 5.7% or $10 million in the first six months of this year compared to the first six months of last year. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $26 million in the second quarter and $51 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Driving that change were increases in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, reflecting growth in both policies and force and average premium per policy in both periods and as Tim pointed out, the exchanges premium growth continues to outpace the industry. Indemnities cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 6.7% in the second quarter and 5.8% in the first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Commissions increased $12 million in the second quarter and $21 million in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018. That increase was driven by the growth in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange somewhat offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth. Non-commissioned expenses in the second quarter increased $14 million compared to last year driven by increases in information technology costs of $6 million, administrative and other expenses of $5 million and customer service costs of $2 million. In the first six months of 2019 non-commissioned expenses increased $22 million compared to the same period in 2018 driven by a $12 million increase in information technology costs and a $9 million increase in administrative and other costs. The increased information technology costs were due to higher professional fees and the increased administrative and other costs were due to an increase in long-term incentive planned cost driven by the higher stock price during the year. Total investment income increased $3 million in the second quarter of 2019 and over $7 million in the first half of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The increases were driven primarily by growth in our net realized gains in both periods. Finally, indemnities income tax expense decreased in the second quarter by $3 million but remained relatively flat for the first six months compared to the same period in 2018. We take a measured approach to capital management and diligently maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first six months of 2019, our strong performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders nearly $84 million in dividends. With that I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks Greg. Our financial foundation is strong, positioning Erie well for continued profitable growth and a bright future. We continue to invest in that future with a focus on four areas; strengthening our business platforms and use of data, continuing to enhance the Erie experience, identifying and developing new sources of revenue and preparing the workforce of the future. We're making progress across all four areas. Our recent achievements include further expansion of efforts to strengthen our competitive position and create revenue opportunities. We recently introduced a web-based driver training program designed to reduce motor vehicle accidents among young drivers. Teen drivers in Virginia and Wisconsin are using the program now and earning discounts on their auto insurance premiums. This program compliments our expanding telematics program, which rewards teens for good driving behavior and is on track for introduction to all states as we head into 2020. In our homeowners\u2019 line of business, we're nearing the finish line for converting policies from our legacy home protector program to our web-based Erie secure home platform. This conversion is significant on a number of fronts. It simplifies our agents processes for writing home owners business with Erie. They'll have one platform for this line of business and easy to sell bundles to customize a customer's coverage. The conversion also gets us one step closer to a full online capabilities for personal lines further improving the experience of our agents when it comes to writing and servicing this high-volume line of business. And lastly, with the conversion we're able to offer all of our homeowners, customers industry-leading coverages and protection. I'm very pleased to share that the conversion has gone extremely well for agents and customers alike. We're on track to complete this change in most states by year-end. Finally, I want to share recent developments aimed at sharpening our focus on innovation. Innovation has long been a key function of Erie both within our core operations and within a team that has dedicated to exploring new opportunities and advancing experiments with new technology. One of our senior leaders Keith Kennedy is taking on this charge and leading what we call next-level innovation. Keith and his team are responsible for evaluating opportunities to advance our capabilities to deliver products and services beyond our current offerings while also assisting with innovation where necessary in our core business. Keith brings to his new role more than 20 years of broad experience in helping organizations define and build new products and capabilities. He's been a part of our team since 2008, first in a consulting capacity before he joined the company in 2011 to lead geographic expansion. Keith has built a strong network of like-minded leaders most recently through his work with the Erie Pennsylvania innovation district. Before we close I'd like to share some recent recognition for Erie. First AM Best has affirmed Erie's financial strength rating of A+ superior. According to AM Best this rating reflects Erie's strong balance sheet and operating performance in addition to a favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. This is Erie's 80th year in a row to earn at least the A+ rating from AM Best. AM Best also affirmed the A excellent rating for our life subsidiary Erie Family Life. Now I'm very proud to share with you recent recognition that reflects our customers experience with our agents and with Erie. Along with our agents, we've again earned an award from JD Power for the highest customer satisfaction score for auto insurance in the mid-Atlantic region. This is the fifth time Erie has led this region since the auto study moved to regional awards in 2012. Earning this honor for the mid-Atlantic region is especially noteworthy because the area comprises our markets with the highest premium volume; Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. The mid-Atlantic trophy is Erie's second from JD Power this year following our top finish in the 2019 U.S. Auto Insurance Shopping Study. What I really like about these two awards is that they reflect the complete lifecycle of an auto insurance customer from their time shopping and choosing Erie insurance and through the service and renewal of their policy. Together these honors are a great testament to the strength of the value proposition we offer with our agents. It's a value proposition built on protection that matters and service that makes a difference for our customers. Lastly, I want to share some national recognition earned by our employees who serve on Erie's leadership council for diversity and inclusion. The council recently earned a spot among the top 2% of employee resource groups in the United States for the second year in a row placing 21st in the nation for 2019. This list was compiled by the Association of ERG's and councils to recognize the contributions and results of a strong focus on DNI across business operations. Fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce and market is the right thing to do for our employees, agents, customers and communities and it also makes good sense for our business. This is a great honor for our DNI team. I want to thank you for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Erie. Operator :",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2019 third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market close and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions, subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC, dated October 24, 2019, and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you who have a continued interest in the Erie's results and success. During our third quarter of 2019, Erie Indemnity continued the strong favorable performance we saw through the first half of the year. As we reported in our press release, filed yesterday, Indemnity's net income was $94 million or $1.80 per diluted share. That's an increase of $14 million over our third quarter in 2018, and it brings net income year-to-date to $257 million compared to $226 million in the first nine months of 2018, an increase of 14%. Greg will get into the details around Indemnity's results, but before he does, I'll share some of the highlights of the insurance operation we manage, Erie Insurance Exchange. Direct written premium grew by over 5% for the third quarter and year-to-date compared to 2018, which positions the exchange well to once again outperform the industry. Conning's latest forecast for industry growth in direct premium is 4.4%. As we mentioned in the last earnings report, we're continuing to see a more competitive marketplace, with softening prices in private passenger auto. In challenging markets, we, at Erie, maintained a steady, long-term approach to pricing that reinforces our reputation for reliability and stability. Finally, we saw some improvement in the weather during the third quarter. Our claims teams and agents responded to 5 major weather events over the past 3 months, down from 9 in the second quarter. The most recent storms were more localized, affecting customers in North Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin as well as in parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Maryland. That's about half our operating territory. But again, the damaging wind and hail of summer caused more localized damage compared to what we saw in the spring. Our combined ratio for the third quarter was 96.9% compared to 97.6% a year ago. Year-to-date, the combined is 105.7%, higher than a year ago when the combined was 102.1%. It's in times like these that we demonstrate our value to our customers and to our communities that we deliver on our promise of service, our promise to be there and to make things better. My thanks to our Erie agents and, of course, our Erie claims teams for their superior work during these weather events. They have an incredibly difficult and important role in the organization, and they give it their all. And despite the stormy weather, Erie continued to grow its policyholder surplus to over $9 billion, up $500 million for the year, thanks to strong investment returns. Next week, we'll finish our visits we make to all of our field office territories each year where we recognize and celebrate the efforts of our agents and sales teams and the service commitment of our claims teams. Especially in a year of so many damaging storms, I leave these meetings humbled by how incredibly dedicated and hard-working our claims employees are. Both in the field and at our home office campus, I'm frequently approached by employees and agents who share an appreciation for Erie's commitment to being above all in service, not only in terms of customers, but in how we treat each other as employees, how we support our agents and how we show up for our communities. I'll talk more about how that philosophy aligns with our focus on strategic initiatives, ensuring we maintain Erie's distinctive human touch even in a digital world. But first, Greg will review the financial results for the third quarter. Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with the financial results we are seeing this year. They reflect the dedication of our agents and our employees as well as our commitment to be above all in service. Starting with the third quarter of 2019, net income was $94 million or $1.80 per diluted share compared to $80 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, net income was $257 million or $4.92 per diluted share compared to $226 million or $4.32 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2018. Total operating revenue outpaced the growth in total operating expenses in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018. That resulted in growth in operating income of $9 million or 10% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of this year, operating income increased $19 million or 7% over the first 3 quarters of last year. Total management fee revenue increased $24 million in the third quarter and $77 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. This is due to an increase in the direct and assumed premiums written of over 5% in both periods. The increase in both policies in force and average premium per policy contributed to this growth in premiums. Indemnity's total cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased $15 million for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, total cost of operations grew $57 million. Commissions increased $10 million in the third quarter and $31 million year-to-date compared to 2018 as a result of the 5% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. This was partially offset by lower agent incentive costs related to less profitable growth compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2018. Non-commission expenses in the third quarter increased $5 million compared to last year. Information technology costs increased $5 million due to increased professional fees, underwriting and policy processing expenses increased $2 million, and customer service costs increased $1 million. These increases were somewhat offset by administrative and other expenses, which decreased by $3 million in the quarter, driven by lower long-term incentive plan costs due to the decrease in the company's stock price during the third quarter.  In the first nine months of 2019, non-commission expenses increased $26 million compared to the same period in 2018. IT costs increased $17 million as a result of higher professional fees. Administrative and other expenses increased by $6 million, driven by an increase in the long-term incentive plan costs due to a higher company stock price in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by additional bonuses awarded to all employees of approximately $1 million for the first nine months of 2019 and $5 million for the first nine months of 2018. Investment income for the third quarter totaled $14 million, an increase of $5 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of the year, investment income totaled $33 million, which was an increase of $12 million compared to the same period in 2018. Our continued strong operating results have enabled us to pay our shareholders dividends in the amount of $126 million in 2019. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. As we discussed on each earnings call, our strategic focus at Erie is centered on 4 strategic areas that we believe are critical for moving us into the future, we're building on our strong business model and distinctive ability to deliver service with a human touch. The 4 areas are : strengthening our business platforms and use of data, continuing to enhance the Erie experience, identifying and developing new sources of revenue and creating our workforce for the future. I'd like to talk more about the first area, strengthening our platforms and data and how that is leading us to the second, enhancing the Erie experience. I talked a bit about the impact of our service earlier. It's an important but not always obvious, part of the picture, whenever we discuss results. Our service, claims service and customer care is closely tied to our competitive position. The work we are doing to enhance the Erie experience is aimed at improving the experience of all stakeholders, customers, agents and employees, while thoughtfully driving down costs with technology and process that lets us work smarter, but still delivering ways that are personal and customized for the needs and preferences of the individual. Our teams have developed deep understanding of the key drivers of satisfaction in the claims experience. We know, for instance, that customer satisfaction is higher when the initial loss is reported to the agent. We also know that a quarter of customers want the option to report a claim digitally. Our digital strategy is focused on leveraging that kind of knowledge with the power of data and platforms. For example, with better agent access to claims tracking and more billing and payment information online for both agents and customers, we are experiencing reduced call volume and providing greater convenience for the customer and agent. Calls about billing and payments are down 14% compared to last year. That shift drives cost savings and expands the ability of our customer care team to focus on customer calls that are more complex and benefit most from the human touch. Our customer care team is working smarter, too, as a result of our investment in digital capabilities. I shared earlier this year that customer care is using a new streamlined portal that makes access to customer information easier and faster. Since the first quarter launch of the portal, we've seen a reduction in average call time because of this improved access. At the same time, we're maintaining exceptional customer satisfaction ratings. The human touch is at the forefront of our efforts to provide agents and customers more digital capabilities. Online service is critical to our future. And so as the human touch that differentiates the service that comes with an Erie policy and an Erie agent. As one of our North Carolina adjusters recently quoted, \"At Erie, every claim has a name.\" Finally, I'll close with 2 positive notes. First, Erie Insurance was recently among the best homeowners insurance companies of 2019 in a list by U.S. News & World Report. We debuted at #2 on this list behind direct writer, Amica. Erie was recognized for our low rates and unique policy features and customization options. And second, last week, we announced the appointment of Erie's new General Counsel, Brian Bolash. Brian is a long time Erie leader in Senior Counsel, as well as the Corporate Secretary to the Board of Directors. We're excited to have him in this new role, helping to protect Erie's good reputation by overseeing the legal risks and potential issues affecting the company. Thank you again for your time today. We truly appreciate your interest in Erie. End of Q&A: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks everyone for your interest in Erie\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2019 and our year-end results. Your company has ended the year with solid financials, well equipped to take on the New Year, our 95th year of operations. In our press release filed yesterday, we reported net income of $60 million, or $1.14 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2019 to 2018, we saw a decrease in net income of nearly $3 million. However, for the total year 2019, we increased that income by nearly $29 million compared to 2018 driven by strong operating and investment income. Greg will talk in more detail about the financial performance of Erie Indemnity Company. But first, I'd like to share some highlights for the year for the Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, recognizing that a healthy exchange is an integral part of Indemnity\u2019s success. In 2019, the exchange grew property/casualty premium by 5.2% over 2019 to $7.5 billion. This result exceeds Conning's industry growth forecast of 4.6%, making 12 straight years that Erie\u2019s premium growth has outpaced the industry. Driving Erie\u2019s premium growth was a combination of strong retention and higher average premium per policy, particularly in our commercial lines business. Erie\u2019s growth this past year came against the backdrop of a highly competitive market, as I\u2019ve shared on past calls. Pricing indices for the industry show that 2019 saw one of the softest markets for auto insurance in the past two decades. At Erie, we maintained a consistent sustainable approach that reinforces our reputation for reliability and stability and we make pricing decisions with care and a focus on long-term profitability. Both our customers and agents appreciate that stability as reflected in our strong retention rates consistently at or above 90%. Finally, we saw a continued improvement in weather related losses throughout the second half of the year. While catastrophe related claims were more in line with what we experienced in 2018, last year's active spring storm season and the higher severity of those claims drove up increased losses in 2019. The exchange end of the year with a combined ratio of 105 compared to 103 in 2018. Erie continued to grow policyholder surplus to $9.5 billion, up nearly $900 million for the year. That growth reflects strong investment returns. Erie's growth in a tough market reflects the drive and determination of our agents and our teams in sales, marketing, underwriting and products and of course the strength of Erie's value proposition and protection and service demonstrated by our claims and customer service personnel. I want to recognize and thank our agents and employees for their hard work this past year. They\u2019ve delivered in meaningful ways for our customers, our company and our communities. Erie's results of operations and balance sheet are healthy and positioned us well for a successful 2020. I'll talk more about our 2019 progress in a few moments following Greg's review of the financials. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, we saw a solid performance during 2019 and we are positioned to have a successful 95th year in 2020 despite a continued challenging market. I am pleased to share with you both the quarterly and year-end results. Starting with the fourth quarter of 2019, net income was $60 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to $62 million, or $1.19 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Although the fourth quarter saw operating revenue increased $20 million, operating income in the quarter decreased $6 million, down 8.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $17 million, or 4.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a 4.1% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written of the exchange while total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $23 million for the quarter. Commission expenses increased $10 million as a result of the 4.1% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. Non-commission expenses increased $13 million in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Information technology cost increased $6 million due to increased professional fees and hardware and software costs. Administrative and other expenses increased $5 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs, as well as several multi-year commitments we made during the quarter to support community development initiatives. And lastly, underwriting and policy processing costs increased $2 million due to elevated underwriting report costs and other policy acquisition costs. Total pretax investment income in the quarter was nearly $7 million, up $2 million compared to the same period in 2018 driven by an increase in net realized gains on investments. Turning to the full year 2019 results, net income was $317 million, or $6.06 per diluted share, compared to $288 million, or $5.51 per diluted share in 2018. Operating income before taxes increased $13 million, or 3.8%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Management fee revenue earned on the direct and assumed premiums written of the exchange increased $94 million, or 5.3% for the year. Commissions paid to our independent agents increased $41 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulting from a 5.2% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange, somewhat offset by lower agent incentive awards related to less profitable business. Non-commission expenses in 2019 increased nearly $40 million compared to 2018. Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $6 million and the information technology costs increased $23 million due to an increase in professional fees and hardware and software costs. Customer service costs increased $3 million due to an increase in credit card processing fees as well as personnel costs. Finally, administrative and other expenses increased $11 million driven by an increase in long-term incentive plan costs due to a higher company stock price in 2019 compared to 2018 as well as several multi-year commitments we made to support community development initiatives. The increase in non-commission expenses was slightly offset by a decrease in sales and advertising expenses of $3.2 million. Income from investments on a pretax basis totaled $40 million for the year compared to $26 million in 2018. The positive results were driven primarily by an increase in net realized gains of $8 million compared to 2018 as well as a $3 million increase in net investment income. Lastly, in 2019, we paid our shareholders dividends in the amount of $168 million and in December of last year, our board approved a 7.2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for both Class A and Class B shares for 2020. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. We coupled our strong 2019 financials with steady progress on key initiatives during 2019. We continue to invest in our areas of focus as I've shared on each of our calls this past year. These four areas are critical to our future success while we build on our longstanding business model and our deep commitment to service. Those four areas are first strengthening our business platforms and use of data; second, continuing to enhance the Erie experience we create for our customers, agents and employees; third, identifying and developing new sources of revenue; and four, preparing the workforce for the future. We've invested heavily in platforms and data and the Erie experience, two areas of focus that are closely linked. Stronger platforms and use of data enables us to enhance the experience of our customers, agents and employees. Our recent accomplishments include moving nearly half of our legacy homeowners policies online to our contemporary ErieSecure Home product. This was an ongoing transition that is creating new efficiencies for Erie and our agents, while also expanding coverage options for customers. The transition has been largely seamless. We also accelerated delivery of a refreshed Rate Lock product in personal auto. Rate Lock offers customers the ability to lock in their auto insurance rate until they've made a qualifying change. With this refresh, Rate Lock will allow us to provide a more competitive rate to support our agents in pursuing new business more aggressively, while we adhere to steady as you go pricing philosophy and sound underwriting principles. Agents in Pennsylvania, our largest premium volume state, began quoting the refreshed product in January and early indications are positive. The new version of Rate Lock will be rolled out to additional States throughout the year. Well, 2019 was a busy year for claims handling. It was also a year of reshaping the claims experience to better meet the needs of our agents and customers as we integrated digital capabilities with a human touch that is distinctly Erie. On last quarter's call, I spoke about our efforts to engage with our customers, agents and employees to develop a deeper understanding of their needs and expectations. That understanding has influenced our strategy and planning around the Erie experience and has reflected in recent deliveries that enhance the services we provide. For example, in 2019, we introduced real-time claim status online for our agents and in the fourth quarter made that same functionality available to customers. We are among only a handful of carriers that offer real-time claim status to both agents and customers and we do it while continuing to provide the personal caring response of our customer service and claims teams. Additionally, our agents play an integral role in claim service. They take more than 50% of the initial loss reports and our customers continue to express high satisfaction when our agents are involved. Having the ability to see more claims information online and in real-time helps our agents better serve our customers. Customer satisfaction with claims overall remains high based on ongoing customer surveys. Responsiveness, quality and caring are just a few of the common themes we see in customer feedback, whether it's in our surveys or in unsolicited emails and letters. A customer in Tennessee shared this complement during a recent claim. I was amazed with a quick turnaround from the time I reported by an accident to the response of the adjuster and the receipt of the payment for repairs. There was no hassle and I'm glad I switched to Erie Insurance. Before we close, I want to share with you some recent third-party recognition that we're especially proud of. First, Erie Insurance was named one of Forbes Best Employers for Diversity for 2020. This list recognizes 500 companies for their representation of diversity based on an independent anonymous survey of employees. At Erie, we're committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace. We work hard to make sure our nearly 6,000 employees feel supported and appreciated for who they are for their unique attributes and for their contributions to our mission of protection and service. The second recognition we received comes from BenchmarkPortal, an industry leader in customer contact center best practices. Following a lengthy process, BenchmarkPortal has certified Erie\u2019s first notice of loss team as a center of excellence. This honor reflects the commitment and effort of this team to serve our customers with real concern and compassion every day. Our first notice of loss team is often the initial contact our customers have with Erie when reporting a claim. The certification recognizes the FNOL team's performance beyond industry benchmarks for efficiencies and service. FNOL is Erie\u2019s second call center to earn benchmark certification. In 2017, our customer care operations were also recognized as a center of excellence. Congratulations to our team and first notice of loss. They set a high bar for service and routinely exceed those expectations for the benefit of our customers, agents and the company. Thank you again for your time and interest in Erie. Have a great day everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. A -:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2020 first quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market close and are available within the Investor Relations section of our Web site, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-K filing with the SEC, dated May 7, 2020, and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott. And thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the first quarter of 2020. I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and staying safe. These last few months have demanded a lot from all of us, deeply impacting how we live, how we work, and how we connect with one another. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the pandemic. I want to extend our sincere appreciation to those serving on the frontlines, the first responders and healthcare providers, and to the workers on the job every day making sure we have deliveries, food, and other necessities. I also want to express my gratitude to our nearly 6,000 employees and the 13,000 license agents who make up the Erie family. As members of an essential industry, all of us have adapted, and adapted quickly to new ways of working and serving our customers. Every day our agents and customer care team have challenging conversations with our customers. Some have lost loved ones. Others are no longer working or are facing the potential loss of the business they built. These complex situations not only require a high level of care and empathy, which our agents and employees are showing, but also actions that will give our customers some relief and piece of mind in these uncertain times. I'd like to talk more about how we're doing that before we get into Erie's performance for the first quarter. Next week, we'll start mailing policyholder dividends to our personal auto and commercial auto customers, providing roughly $200 million in immediate financial relief. The divided reflects the significant decline in both miles driven and auto insurance claims that we've seen across our territory due to stay-at-home directives. This immediate relief represents about 35% of the customers' auto insurance premiums over a two-month period or a 5% of their annual premium. The average annual premium per personal auto policy is $1,400. So that provides eligible customers an average dividend of $70. The dividend is in addition to the rate reductions in personal and commercial auto insurance which we announced last month. The overall rate reduction is 5%, so the impact will vary by state and individual customer. These reductions are being implemented state by state, and most will be effective in the third quarter with a few states following in Q4. Through the dividends and rate reductions we're providing our customers a combined total of $400 million in both immediate relief and sustained support. These actions build on the long-standing efforts of our agents and customer care team who are working with customers one on one, offering flexibility in billing and payments as well as the protection that meets their individual needs. We believe this multipronged approach makes a more meaningful different for our customers. We've received a lot of customer feedback affirming this. A long-time customer from Pennsylvania wrote, \"My customer rep was very understanding of my concerns. He helped me change my payment plan to monthly, which I felt would be easier to budget. I have been an Erie customer for almost 30 years, and appreciate their shared values and efforts during this time of uncertainty.\" Our comprehensive package of relief doesn't end with our customers. We're also providing additional financial support for the communities we serve. We recently increased the amount of funding available to our field office and to our agents to support charitable giving across our footprint. In our hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania, where a leading partner in a fund established to support nonprofit organizations helping local residents impacted by the pandemic. All in, Erie has provided almost $2.6 million to charitable works throughout our territories, since March. Our agents and employees have stepped up in big ways too, feeding first responders and healthcare workers in partnership with local restaurants. Some have purchased gift cards to give to those on the frontlines, while also supporting businesses and their community. Many have donated cash and much needed supplies, like facemasks. While the majority of our workforce is now remote, our claims teams continue to serve customers in the field, and the limited number of essential employees are reporting to our offices across our footprint. These employees are performing work critical to our operations, and we believe that extra level of commitment should be rewarded. We are providing up to an extra $500 in biweekly compensation for these employees. Lastly, we have extended assistance to our agents to help maintain agency revenue through our commission protection program. The program provides an interest-free loan to fill the gap between Erie commissions earned in March, and those earned in April, May, and June. These immediate and long-term actions to support our customers, agents, employees, and communities are guided by our 95-year commitment to being above all in service. We are very fortunate to have a strong financial foundation that allows us to offer that support when it's needed the most. I'll talk more about our response to the pandemic and progress on key initiatives in a few minutes, following Greg's review of the financials. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning everyone and thank you for your time today. I am happy to be sharing with you today the first quarter financial results for Erie Indemnity Company. Before I begin, I'd like to comment on the obvious. These are unprecedented times, and it is in times such as these that our above all in service mantra is earned. Tim shared with you earlier the many ways in which we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to assure you that because of the financial strength of both the Erie Insurance exchange and Erie Indemnity Company, we are well-positioned to continue our mission in support of our customers, agents, employees and shareholders in this difficult time. In fact, on April 20, the Board of Directors again approved the quarterly dividend of 96-and-half cents per Class A share to be paid in July. Also on April 20, Erie Indemnity Company held its 95th annual shareholders meeting because of the current state home order in place in Pennsylvania. We held this year's meeting virtually, although the meeting had a very different feel than years past. The message of continued outstanding financial results and superior financial strength were the same. Now let's turn our focus to the first quarter results for 2020. Starting with the exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the first quarter was 3.5%. While the combined ratio for the quarter was 95%. The exchange's policyholder surplus remains strong at $8.8 billion, down from $9.5 billion at the end of 2019, due to unrealized losses in the investment portfolio. Now shifting to Indemnity, first quarter 2020 net income was $59 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $75 million, or $1.44 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019. Operating income decreased $400,000 or 0.5% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2019, as the growth in total operating revenue fell just short of the growth in total operating expenses. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $13 million, or 3% to $444 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2019. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $1 million, or 5.9% to nearly $15 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the same period last year. Turning to Indemnity's cost of operations related to policy issuance and renewal services, commissions increased $9 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2019. This was a result of the 3.5% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the exchange. Non-commission expense increased $5 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter 2019. Underwriting policy processing expense increased $3 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report cost. Information technology costs increased $3 million, primarily due to increased professional fees and personnel costs. Administrative and other expenses decreased $2 million, primarily driven by a decrease in the long-term incentive plan cost due to a decrease in the company stock price in the first quarter of 2020, compared to an increase in the first quarter of 2019. Losses from investments before taxes totaled $9 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to income of nearly $10 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net realized losses were $11 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to net realized gains of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The losses were driven by decreases in the fair value of equity securities due to significant financial market volatility, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net impairment losses of $3 million in the first quarter of 2020 were also driven by the COVID-19 pandemics impact on the financial markets. Losses from limited partnerships were almost $4 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to losses of $1 million in the first quarter of last year. In closing, I want to reiterate what I mentioned earlier. We are positioned well to handle these trying times. Through our nearly 6000 employees and over 13,000 agents across our footprint, Erie Indemnity will remain above all-in-service. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks Greg. COVID-19 has presented challenges unlike anything many of us experienced or expected, but with our strong financial position, as Greg just reported, we have a lot working in our favor at Erie. We now have the benefit of being past the initial surprise that came in March when much of the United States was directed to stay at home. We've since become accustomed to the rhythm of change and uncertainty. Over the past several weeks, we've shown how well we can respond and adapt. Within just one week in March, we grew our remote workforce from 34% to 95%. Ours is an essential industry. And well we and our agents have continued operations and service to our customers. We are seeing impacts on our business as a result of the pandemic. Starting with the top line, we like the rest of the property, casualty industry expect pressure on premium growth in 2020 due to the economic challenges. We're delivering on plans to shore up our competitive position in the auto insurance market. We also continue to invest in key initiatives to support our agent's growth with Erie. I'll talk more about some of those efforts and early results in a moment. As always, we continue to be disciplined in our spending and we'll make decisions that protect our strong financial foundation. The other piece of our financial picture impacted by COVID-19 is our losses. Some states have made moves to expand the scope of business interruption and workers compensation to provide coverage for COVID-19 related losses, we continue to monitor those efforts and are working closely with our industry partners like the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, to make sure that our lawmakers and regulators have the complete understanding of the insurance model and the impacts of their decisions. Our commercial customers and our agents are all small business owners. We understand the challenges they face daily and the pain they're feeling now. We are doing what we can to help and continue to consider additional support through this difficult and unprecedented time. It is critical that Erie and our industry retain a strong financial foundation so that we can be there for our customers with the protection and service we promise in every policy. I'm really proud of our team, our employees, and agents for coming together and adapting quickly to this new environment. In addition to the financial support I talked about earlier, we're enhancing some of our existing products and processes to create new opportunities for serving customers. For a limited time, Erie Family Life, or life insurance operation is offering many applicants a past life insurance coverage without the requirement of an in person paramedical exam. To date, 1,450 customers have exercised the offer. For customers with our ErieSecure Home Insurance coverage, we're now providing reimbursement for gift card balances that can no longer be used if a business closes. This enhancement is being added at no additional cost. We recently expanded digital capabilities for our customers so that requests for less complex changes can be made online. This expansion builds on Erie's Online Account platform which continues to gain more and more active customers, providing additional self service capabilities has also helped increase the capacity of our customer care team to focus on more complex customer needs. We'll be taking this capability to agents next. In late January, we introduced a refresh of our Erie Rate Lock product in Pennsylvania. In February, in March alone, Pennsylvania auto applications were up 14% over last year, giving us a strong start in our largest state for premium volume. Rate Lock offers customers the ability to lock in their auto insurance rate until they've made a qualifying change. The Refresh provides a more competitive rate to help our agents pursue new business while we adhere to our steady pricing philosophy and underwriting discipline. Agents in Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia recently started quoting Refresh Rate Lock pricing with a positive initial response. Additional states will gain the same benefit throughout the year. We're confident that the Refresh coupled with the auto insurance rate reductions I mentioned earlier, will create an even stronger long-term competitive position for our agents to support both new and renewal business. Additionally, we remain on track to deliver new products and an enhanced experience for agents and customers in both commercial lines and life insurance. In commercial lines, we're working towards delivery of the streamlined commercial multi-peril product starting in September. The products will include new coverages and employ a new platform creating efficiencies for Erie and our agents. For our commercial customers, the product will provide an easy to understand package a protection, backed by support for risk management, and peace of mind that the right protections and service are there when needed. Family Life is making strong progress on a transactional Term Life product written in a process similar to personal lines, for customers they will have an opportunity to protect loved ones financial well being and a fast, easy process and at a price point that fits most budgets. Last month, we marked a significant milestone in Erie's history, our 95th anniversary, but these aren't normal times. And along with other gatherings, events and flights in general, our plans for a celebration are on hold. This pandemic has changed so many aspects of how we live and work. What it hasn't done though is dampen the Erie family spirit. I've seen amazing things happen in Erie over these past several weeks. We've more than doubled our remote workforce. Our customer care team has shown an extremely high level of compassion for our customers facing hardships. Our claims employees continue the necessary work to serve our customers and across Erie, we continue to challenge ourselves to do the right thing for our employees, our agents, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. I say this often, and I say it, because I truly believe it. We're all in this together, and we'll get through this together. Thank you for your continued interest in Erie. Take care, and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. End of Q&A:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call was pre-recorded and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. You may proceed. Scott Beilharz : Thank you and welcome, everyone.

With that, we will move on to Tim\u2019s remarks. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott. And thank you everyone for your time today and your interest in Erie\u2019s second quarter results. Before we talk about our quarterly financials, I want to touch on a couple of topics that are certainly top of mind for us, as a business, and more importantly, as people. First, the pandemic. As the coronavirus spread and states have opened up quickly, all of us at Erie remain grateful to the healthcare professionals and essential workers, who deliver every day with great courage and caring. Some of the actions we\u2019ve taken regarding remote work have been taken to protect our employees and help stem the spread of the disease and its impact on the healthcare system in our communities. While the majority of our 6,000 employees continue to work remotely, we have a few hundred essential workers who remain onsite throughout our 12-state footprint. These are the employees maintaining our network and data systems, facilities and construction teams, and handling cash processing and other critical functions that can only be performed on site. Together with more than 13,000 Erie licensed agents, our employees, wherever they\u2019re working, are consistently delivering on Erie\u2019s promise of service throughout these trying times. As I shared with you in May, our support for customers includes $400 million in financial relief for our personal and commercial automobile customers. This included $200 million in policyholder dividends and an overall 5% rate reduction for those policies. We mailed $2.5 million dividend checks addressed for more than 1,400 customers, who responded with greeting cards, letters and emails, thanking Erie and our agents. Most [note of the check] [ph] which average about $75, made a meaningful difference from helping with the weekly grocery bill to affirming their decision doing business with Erie. I wanted to share one comment from a customer in Wisconsin. Not only did the dividend check, bring a smile on my face, it looks like a ray of sunshine. That may seem flowery, she wrote, but with all that\u2019s going on in our country, it made my day brighter. That customer also told us that she\u2019s giving away her dividend to a local food pantry to help her neighbors hit especially hard by the pandemic and financial crisis, who\u2019s actually one of many customers who said they would pay it forward and donate their dividend to the pandemic relief efforts. Our agents have stepped up in big ways too, with more than $2 million in community relief funding from Erie bolstering our efforts, our agents help, be it, frontline workers and first responders, support local businesses and give money to charities in need. This important work was reflected in nearly 2,000 stories they hear on social media. Our employees and agents all share a deep belief in service and caring and in doing the right things, both in our community and the work we do every day as we grow our business and serve our customers. Before we move into the financials, I want to address the dialogue that is occurring across our country and within our communities around race and racism. It\u2019s a conversation that was happening in Erie as well with employees across the organization as we broaden perspectives and create positive change in our workplace and in our communities. Those conversation, we are committed to continuing. At Erie, we do not tolerate racism or other forms of discrimination of any kind within our employment or agency force. We believe in promoting environment of mutual respect. Put simply, we believe in the golden rule, we strive to treat all people with dignity and respect each of us deserves. Thank you. It\u2019s important to me that you know where we stand. Let\u2019s move on to the second quarter in the year financial results. As you saw in our press release, filed July 30, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $82 million or $1.57 per diluted share for the second quarter. Like the rest of property/casualty industry, our second quarter results reflected the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related financial crisis. I am confident in our response, in our support of agents and customers, and our ability to continue to grow, albeit in a slower pace as we adapt to the current normal. Our productions continue to rebound as our agents with the help of our sales team have adjusted to this new way of working, and are once again focused on growth. Losses remain below normal levels stemming from a relatively mild screening across our territory and industry-wide reduction in miles driven. And overall, our financial position remains extremely solid despite the tumultuous fear our country and our world has experienced. I\u2019ll talk more about our progress on key initiatives in a few minutes after Greg provides a deeper review of our financials. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity second quarter earnings call. Throughout Erie\u2019s 95 years of operations, we\u2019ve faced many challenges, including things outside of our control, like the pandemic. Through all these challenges our focus is on consistent delivery of superior service and products for our customers and agents; a superior work environment for our employees; and most relevant to today\u2019s discussion, delivery of superior financial performance to our shareholders. Starting with the exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the second quarter was 0.5% driven by strong growth in renewal premium, which climbed almost 3% over the prior year. With a combined ratio for the quarter of 95.7% and the improved financial markets experienced during the second quarter, the exchange\u2019s policyholder surplus grew to $9.4 billion, up substantially from $8.8 billion in the previous quarter. Now, shifting to Indemnity. In the second quarter, Indemnity\u2019s net income was $82 million or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to $88 million or $1.68 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. For the first half of 2020, net income was $141 million or $2.70 per diluted share compared to $163 million or $3.12 per diluted share in the first half of 2019. Operating income decreased 5.6% or $5 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Indemnity also saw a decrease in operating income of 3.2% or $6 million for the first 6 months of this year, compared to the first 6 months of last year. Indemnity\u2019s management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $3 million or 1% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the first 6 months of 2020, Indemnity saw an increase of $16 million or 2% compared to the first half of 2019. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $600,000 in the second quarter and $1.4 million in the first half of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Turning to Indemnity\u2019s cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services, commissions increased $5 million in the second quarter and $14 million for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were primarily driven by the increased incentive awards due to improved profitability resulting from lower claims activity in 2020. Also contributing to the increased commission costs for the first 6 months of 2020 was the 2% growth in the direct and affiliate assumed premiums written by the exchange. Non-commission expense increased $4 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019. Information technology costs increased by $2 million, driven by increases in professional fees and hardware-and-software costs, primarily to support remote work capabilities for our employees. Sales and advertising costs increased by $2 million, primarily driven by a new program to support agent charitable giving in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first 6 months of 2020, Indemnity saw an increase in the non-commission expense of nearly $9 million, driven by increases in technology costs of $5 million, underwriting and policy processing expenses of nearly $3 million, and sales and advertising costs of $2 million. All expense categories in our non-commission expenses record increased personnel costs, stemming from increased vacation expense accruals related to employees canceling or postponing vacations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Administrative and other expenses decreased a little over $2 million in the first 6 months, primarily driven by a decrease in long-term incentive plan costs due to a smaller increase in the company\u2019s stock price during the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Income from investments before taxes totaled $12 million in the second quarter and $2 million in the first 6 months of 2020. Both the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2020 were impacted by market volatility brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. In closing, I want to reiterate that we continue to take a measured approach to capital management and diligently maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 6 months of 2020, our solid performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders nearly $90 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. With the strong financial position, Erie remains well equipped for continued investment in our operations, our service capabilities and in our competitive position, which is critical as economic contraction continues. Our teams continue to execute on initiatives that will make a positive difference for our agents and customers this year and beyond. One of the most significant deliveries planned for this year will come in August with the launch of the streamlined commercial multi-peril product called [re-secure the business] [ph]. In addition to new coverages, the product will come with a new platform that will create efficiencies for Erie and our agents. Customers will have the benefit of an easy to understand package of protection, valuable risk management services and claim support. Starting next month, Erie Family Life will introduce a new instant issue life insurance product that provides our agents with easy to sell, competitive term and whole life product options to complement a personal auto policy. Point of Sale for the product will occur within an agent\u2019s workflow recording a personal auto policy or endorsement, which we believe will empower more agents to sell life insurance to more customers. We continue to roll out, refresh Erie Rate Lock product to customers in more states. As of June 30, agents in 4 states were offering this more competitive product, which provides customers, the ability to lock in their auto rate until they\u2019ve made a qualifying change. This refresh along with plans to reduce auto insurance rates overall, create an even stronger long-term competitive position for our agents to support both new and renewal business. Early results were positive. Applications were up 10% in states where the new Erie Rate Lock is offered. We also continue to evolve our service offerings to ensure that we meet our customers where they are, and in the ways they want to receive service. We recognize that for many customers that can change by the need of the day, even by the hour. One enhancement we\u2019ve seen, take on greater importance in recent months is ePay. This service delivers claims payments directly to customers\u2019 bank accounts in as little as 30 minutes. And Erie was one of the first insurers to offer this option. And just recently, we hit a milestone with more than $100 million in claims payments made through ePay. That sum reflects more than 35,000 transactions, which we expect will continue to grow. Currently, more than 1 in 4 eligible claims is now paid through ePay. Before we close, I want to share a few accolades earned by Erie since our first quarter call. First, Erie moved up 5 spots in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest American corporations from 381 to 376, based on total revenue from the 2019 fiscal year. Our ranking among this prestigious group for the past 17 years, speaks to Erie\u2019s strong financial position and our commitment to service. Additionally, the credit rating agency, AM Best, affirm the financial strength rating of A+ Superior for the property/casualty numbers of Erie insurance group. Erie has retained at least an A+ rating for more than 80 years in a row. Our ratings from AM Best reflect Erie\u2019s strong balance sheet and operational performance. In addition to favorable risk business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. The agency also affirmed the A Excellent of Erie Family Life Insurance Company. Lastly, I\u2019m very pleased to share that Erie Center of Excellence team earned certification from BenchmarkPortal. This is one of the most respected awards in the customer service and support industry. The certification reflects the team\u2019s hard work, commitment to collaboration with our customer care and First Notice Of Loss call center teams to bring stronger data-driven decision making. Both of these areas, customer care and First Notice Of Loss also holds certifications from BenchmarkPortal creating a trifecta of superior service. In closing, these are unusual times [to be for.] [ph] I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our team at Erie and our agents for their commitment and hard work and adaptability during these times. It makes a difference for all of us associated with Erie. Thank you for your continued interest in Erie. Please take care and stay safe. Q - : Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I'd like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2020 third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market close and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause these differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC, dated October 29, 2020, and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott. And thanks to all of you for taking the time to learn more about Erie's performance in the third quarter of 2020. It's hard to believe it's been more than seven months since COVID-19 changed the way we live and work. All of us at Erie remain grateful to those keeping our healthcare system and economy in good standing by providing essential services. And more recently to the teachers, who are navigating this new and challenging territory over virtually and in the classroom. They're all very deserving of our appreciation and our respect. Here at Erie, more than 95% of our workforce continues to work from home, both for their protection and that of the employees who continue to report to our offices to perform essential duties across our 12-state footprint. I'm proud to echo something I mentioned last quarter, even with this new way of working, our productivity is not wavered. I'm continually impressed with how well our nearly 6,000 employees and 13,000 licensed Erie agents have been able to adapt to new challenges and demands presented by the pandemic. We're continuing to focus on production, innovation, and of course, delivering our trademark service. And while some of our competitors have announced significant workforce reductions over the past few months, we've been able to maintain our 95-year track record of security and stability for our employees through proactive cross-training in areas like underwriting and customer care. Along with our employees, our agents have also been able to maintain profitable growth and production, while adapting to a new way of working. That is evident in our premium growth, which continues to outpace the overall industry, as you learn more about in a few minutes. We're facing a very competitive environment. If the demand for digital capabilities was high before the pandemic now it's reached a fever pitch. Even those weren't necessarily comfortable with digital tools are now using them out of necessity. And all carriers are working to hone their virtual capabilities. While the pandemic has brought digital to the forefront, it also placed a renewed importance on something that can't be found behind the screen and that's the human touch. And the absence of it that human touch has become even more powerful. And along with our employees who embrace our service promise every day, the people who are delivering the human touch to our customers are the independent agents who represent Erie in their local communities. They offer something that many carriers lack but customers crave, our agents and the dedication they had to Erie is the number one thing that sets us apart from our competition. Let's move on to our third quarter financial results. As you saw in our press release filed after the market closed yesterday, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $89 million or a $1.71 per diluted share for the quarter. As I noted earlier, despite the competitive and challenging environment we face this year, we are outpacing the industry and premium growth while Conning has forecasted industry premium growth of 0.3% for 2020, we currently stand at 2% for the year. Once again, this is a testament to the hard work and agility of our sales team and agency force, who remained focused on profitable growth and retention over the past several months. On the claim side, losses remained below normal levels. This stems from a relatively uneventful summer in terms of weather events across our territory, as well as an industry-wide reduction in miles driven. Overall, our financial position remains solid despite the unprecedented year of change we're experiencing nationally and globally. I'll talk more about progress on some key products and initiatives in a few minutes after Greg's review of the financials, Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity Company\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Last quarter, I spoke to you about Erie continually delivering superior performance even when facing a global pandemic. I spoke to you regarding our duty to provide best-in-class products for our agents, a safe work environment for our employees and strong financial performance for our shareholders. I can proudly say that through the amazing examples Tim has provided and the financials that I will address we have yet again, delivered in each area for our key stakeholders, even in a time of immense uncertainty. This month, Erie reached a major milestone, celebrating 25 years on the NASDAQ stock exchange. We are proud of the success and the growth that we have achieved, not only for our company, but for our shareholders as well. Thank you for your continued investment in Erie. Now I'd like to share with you our third quarter results. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the third quarter was 2% driven by strong growth in new business premium, which climbed 10% over the prior year, with a combined ratio for the quarter of 89.6%. The Exchange's policyholder surplus grew to almost $10 billion, up substantially from $9.4 billion in the previous quarter. Now shifting to the Indemnity Company, in the third quarter, Indemnity\u2019s net income was $89 million or $1.71 per diluted share, compared to $94 million or $1.80 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2019. For the first nine months of 2020, net income was $231 million or $4.41 per diluted share, compared to $257 million or $4.92 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2019. Operating income before taxes decreased 9.1% or $10 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to the third quarter of 2019. Indemnity also saw a decrease in operating income before taxes of 5.4% or $16 million in the first nine months of this year, compared to the same period in 2019. Indemnity\u2019s management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $10 million or 2.1% in the third quarter of 2020, compared to the third quarter of 2019. While for the first time months of 2020, Indemnity saw an increase of $26 million or 1.9%, compared to the first nine months of 2019. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $500,000 in the third quarter and $1.9 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. Turning to Indemnity\u2019s cost of operations, commissions increased $6 million in the third quarter and $20 million for the first nine months of 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019. The increases in the agent compensation in both the third quarter and year-to-date were driven by the growth in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, as well as increased incentive awards due to improved profitability, resulting from lower automobile claims in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-commission expense increased $13 million in third quarter of 2020, compared to the third quarter of 2019. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $3 million, primarily due to increases in personnel costs and the underwriting report costs. Information technology costs increased by $1 million, also driven by increased personnel costs; administrative and other costs increased $9 million, primarily driven by increases in our incentive plan award accruals due to the Exchange\u2019s lower combined ratio and an increase in the company stock price in the third quarter of this year, compared to a decrease in the company stock price in the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date for 2020 Indemnity saw an increase in non-commissioned expenses of nearly $22 million. Increases in technology costs of $6 million were driven by personnel costs, professional fees, as well as hardware and software costs. Underwriting and policy processing expenses increased $6 million due to increases in personnel costs and underwriting report costs. And finally administrative and other expenses increased a little over $6 million in the first nine months, primarily driven by increases in personnel costs and professional fees. Increased personnel costs in all categories included higher incentive plan awards due to the exchanges lower combined ratio and higher vacation accruals as employees took less vacation in the first nine months of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Income from investments before taxes totaled $16 million in the third quarter and $19 million in the first nine months of 2020. The investment results for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the financial markets. In closing, despite the uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, your company continues to deliver strong financial results, which has enabled us to pay our shareholders nearly $135 million in dividend this year. Thank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. As I touched on earlier, our teams have been doing an amazing job of executing on several key initiatives even in this adapted environment. Just in the last quarter, we've significant progress on some new products and services that will improve the way we work with our agents and provide service to our customers. One of the most notable was the release of a new mobile app in September. Using the mobile app, Erie customers can access their policy information and insurance ID cards, view the status of a claim, check their billing activity, make a payment or get in touch with their agent. A team of employees and agent task force members collaborated on bringing this tool to the market. Throughout every step of the apps design and construction, they tested it with both agents and customers, gathered feedback and implemented changes accordingly. This resulted in a highly user-friendly tool that is quickly gaining traction with customers. In the first month, the app had more than 10,000 downloads. Turning to product updates in late August, we started the rollout of Erie\u2018s new single product solution for commercial multi-peril, Erie Secure business. Seven standalone legacy policies have been reimagined into one single powerful product delivered on the streamline interface of Erie's commercial quote application and service or QAS system. Agents can quote bind and issue a new policy in less than nine minutes, exceeding our goal for turnaround time. Agents in Tennessee were the first tab access and in just the first month, more than 80% of agencies across the state quoted this new product. Earlier this month, the product was introduced in four more States North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Agents in the remaining States will be quoting Erie Secure business in November. We also rolled out a new life product in August. Erie express light is an instant issue life insurance product that can be quoted bound and issued during the auto insurance quote and application process. This can be done in just five to 10 minutes without the need for a medical exam or a physician statement. This product opens up a whole new avenue for agents to start those critical conversations about life insurance, it makes it simple and straightforward for customers to get protection for themselves and for their loved ones. Our refreshed and a more competitive Erie Rate Lock product continues to rollout and is now being offered by agents in eight States. Erie Rate Lock provides customers the ability to lock in their auto rate until they've made a qualifying change. This refresh along with reduction auto insurance rates overall creates an even stronger long-term competitive position for our agents to support both new and renewal business. As reported in our second quarter, early results are positive. Applications are up more than 10% in States, where the new Rate Lock is offered. We're also pleased to report that the conversion of more than 850,000 legacy home protector policies to the new Erie Secure Home product is more than 90% complete. Converting these policies creates greater efficiencies for agents and employees, while also giving existing customers access to Erie Secure Homes industry leading bumbled coverages, including underground service line and equipment breakdown coverage. Pandemic has prompted us to reflect on what matters most at Erie. And the racial inequity and social justice issues that have taken on greater urgency in the public consciousness have prompted us to reflect on how we're promoting and pursuing diversity, equity and inclusion, both on our teams and in our customer base. One way we're taking action on this is through a diversity production incentive offer introduced to our agency force in August. Although the program had been more than a year in the making, the current climate across the country serves as a reminder of how important and relevant it is. To participate in the program, agencies develop and share business plan is focused on growing diversity in their team or customer base through marketing efforts, community activities, networking initiatives or hiring additional staff. If approved, they receive funding to support these efforts with the potential for loan forgiveness, if they're successful. It's important to mention that this program is focused on all aspects of diversity, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, physical abilities, and more. It didn't take long for our agents to get on board. We began approving agencies for the program within just two weeks of the announcement, starting in Ohio, where one agency is using this financial support to fund marketing focused on the strong local LGBTQ community. I'm proud that our agents are eager to step up and do the work to ensure that we have a rich and diverse workforce and that we're meeting the unique needs of every customer. I'm looking forward to seeing the great things our agency force does with this program. Before we close, I want to share a few recognitions and third-party accolades. First I'd like to congratulate Ron Habursky, who was appointed Senior Vice President of Investments and Chief Investment Officer. Ron has been with Erie 21 years and most recently served as Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager of fixed income portfolios. Ron was instrumental in building out Erie's alternative investment portfolio and brings to his new role and extensive background in both fixed income and equity investments. I'm pleased to announce that Erie has been recognized on Forbes\u2019 inaugural list of America's best in state insurance companies. And is one of only a few carriers earn awards in all five product categories, auto, homeowners, renters, term life and permanent life insurance. Also Money magazine named Erie its top pick for comprehensive renter's insurance, noting that we offer several policy bundles that combine our base renter's policy with a variety of endorsements. We were also honored this month to be named among America's best customer service companies for 2021 in Newsweek magazine. These recognitions are a nod to our enduring commitment to our finding purpose. To provide our policyholders with his near perfect protection and his near perfect service as humanly possible and to do so at the lowest possible cost. As we move into the final quarter of this, our 95 anniversary, I'd like to say how grateful I am for the dedication and resiliency of our employees and agents and for the continued support and trust of our shareholders. While we continue to face uncertain times, the strength and stability this company continues to demonstrate is a point of distinction and pride for me and I hope for all of you. Thank you all for your continued interest in Erie, I hope you and your loved ones stay well. Q - : Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I would like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Please go ahead. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone.

With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the fourth quarter of 2020 and our year-end results. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe and are ready to move forward positively in 2021. Last year was unlike any other, it demanded a lot from us as individuals and as a company, and it deeply impacted how we live, how we work and how we connect with one another. The culture of Erie has been an incredible asset in helping us get through this together. And I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the nearly 6,000 employees and 13,000 licensed agents who make up our Erie Family. They adapted seamlessly to the new ways of serving our customers and keeping our business thriving over the course of this uncertain and often challenging year. In March, as the threat of the pandemic became more clear, we equipped more than 95% of our employees to work from home in a matter of days. This was to keep them safe and to reduce the risk of exposure to the small number of dedicated employees whose roles require them to be in the office. I have received countless messages for members of the Erie Family expressing appreciation for the actions we have taken over the past year to keep their well-being a priority. In April, we provided $400 million in financial relief for our personal and commercial automobile customers, including $200 million in policyholder dividends and an overall 5% rate reduction for those policies. After the 2.5 million dividend checks were distributed, we heard from thousands of customers who responded with greeting cards, letters and emails, thanking Erie and our agents. To support communities across our geographic footprint, we provided an additional $2.5 million to agents and branch offices to support charitable work in local communities. Our agents and employees stepped up in good ways to help feed frontline workers and first responders, support local businesses and give money to charities in need. This important work was reflected in nearly 2,000 stories shared on social media. The safety and well-being to our customers, agents, employees and communities has been at the forefront of everything we have done in response to the pandemic. While it is not how any of us expected to spend our 95th year, this balanced and intentional approach reflects just how committed we are to our long-standing principles of service and doing the right thing. Let's move on to our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. As reported in our press release filed after the market closed yesterday, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $63 million or $1.20 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, that was an increase of $3 million. Greg will talk in more detail about the financial performance of Erie Indemnity Company in a few minutes. But first, I would like to share some highlights for the year for the Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operations that we manage, recognizing that a healthy exchange is an integral part of Indemnity's success. Policyholder surplus of the Exchange grew to $10.7 billion, up almost 1.3 billion for the year, reflecting a disciplined approach to underwriting and a sharpened focus on investments. Over the past 10-years, the Exchange's surplus has more than doubled. This surplus allowed us to provide the policyholder dividend to our automobile customers that I mentioned earlier. In 2020, the Exchange grew property and casualty premium 2% over 2019 to $7.6 billion. Rig reductions led to lower average premium per policy, but total policies grew by a solid 2.1%. On the claims side, our territory saw fewer catastrophic events in 2020 compared to 2019. This, along with an industry-wide reduction in miles driven due to the pandemic, led to below normal losses and a combined ratio of 93.7% compared to 105% at the end of 2019. Despite the challenges faced over the past year in the industry, the country and the world, we are in a strong place financially and well positioned for a successful 2021. This reflects the dedication and adaptability of the agency force and our teams in sales, marketing, underwriting and products, who ensure that growth and production continued through the challenges. And of course, it underscores the strength of Erie's value proposition of protection and service demonstrated by our claims and customer service personnel, who stepped up to serve our customers in new and meaningful ways. I will highlight some of the progress and accomplishments from 2020 in a few minutes, after Greg provides a deeper review of our financials. Greg. Gregory Gutting : Thank you, Tim. At this time a year ago, I began our year-end discussion by saying that our strong financial performance in 2019 would propel us forward in 2020. Then a month later, our world was turned completely upside down when the COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered our everyday lives and uncertainty of the future became the new normal. Despite the difficulty and challenge that 2020 presented, Erie delivered, and I\u2019m proud to share with you our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial performance. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the fourth quarter was 1%, driven by strong growth in new business premium, which climbed just over 11% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, while total year direct written premium grew almost 2%. I will remind you that the Exchange implemented $200 million in auto rate reductions that began in July of 2020 and will extend through June of 2021. These rate reductions impacted the rate charged on new and renewal policies. With a combined ratio for the quarter of 94.4% and the strong financial markets, the Exchange's policyholder surplus grew to $10.7 billion from $10 billion at the end of the third quarter. The Exchange's total year combined ratio ended significantly better compared to 2019 at 93.7% compared to 105% a year ago. Shifting our focus to Indemnity, net income was $63 million or $1.20 per diluted share compared to $60 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019. 2020 total year net income was $293 million or $5.61 per diluted share compared to $317 million or $6.06 per diluted share in 2019. Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased nearly $4 million or 5.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Comparing year-over-year results, Indemnity's operating income decreased a little over $19 million or 5.4%. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $5 million or 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and $31 million or 1.7% for the total year compared to 2019. The increase for the fourth quarter and for the year were driven by an increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange. The total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $9 million for the quarter and $51 million for the total year 2020. Commission expenses for the fourth quarter grew $6 million, while the total year commission expense increased nearly $27 million. The fourth quarter was impacted mainly by the growth in the direct and assumed premiums written. However, our total year commission expense was driven by two factors : the increase in written premium as well as the higher agent incentive compensation. The Exchange experienced a significant decrease in automobile claims frequency and related loss expenses beginning in March of 2020. That continued through May of 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to an increase in the profitability component of the agent incentive bonuses. Turning to our non-commission expenses. For the fourth quarter, Indemnity saw an increase of $2.5 million compared to the same period in 2019. Administrative and other expenses increased $2.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in long-term incentive plan costs as well as increased personnel costs. For the total year 2020, non-commission expenses grew over $24 million compared to 2019. Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $6 million, IT costs also saw an increase of $6 million, and administrative and other expenses increased $9 million. All expense categories were impacted by increased personnel costs related to more profitable underwriting results in 2020, that led to higher accruals related to incentive compensation awards. Indemnity's fourth quarter pretax income from investments totaled $14 million, an increase of $7 million compared to the same period in 2019. The growth was driven by an increase in net realized gains of $4 million. For the year, pretax income from investments decreased $7 million compared to 2019. The decrease was driven by lower net investment income compared to 2019 and impairment losses of $3 million. Finally, in 2020, we paid our shareholders dividend in the amount of $273 million, which included a onetime special dividend of $2 per share for Class A shareholders. Also, in December of last year, our Board approved a 7.3% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for both Class A and Class B shareholders for 2021. Now I will turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. As we enter 2020, we are pleased to deliver on several key initiatives in support of our strategic focus areas : strengthening business platforms and use of data, enhancing the Erie experience, identifying and developing new sources of revenue, and preparing the workforce in the future. The unexpected challenges presented early in the year by the pandemic could have easily upended those plans. But I'm proud to say that our employees and agents stepped up, often exceeding expectations. As I reported in previous calls, we launched and enhanced several products this year. ErieSecure business, we imagine seven legacy products into one single customizable commercial multi-peril product. Agents can get a quote in about seven minutes, and nearly half of the policies are instantly issued without underwriting review. This is a considerable improvement from the days and weeks those tasks took with legacy products. Since the new product rollout in late 2020, ErieSecure business has generated nearly $35 million in written premium and provided protection of nearly 15,000 businesses. ErieExpress Light, a new instant issue term and whole life product, can be quoted, bound and issued during the auto insurance quote and application process without the need for a medical exam or physician statement. More than 2,400 policies were placed in less than four months after it was introduced in August. Erie Rate Lock, which provides customers with an option to lock in their auto rate until they made a qualifying change, was refreshed with more competitive pricing and rolled out in 10 states. Auto conversion rates increased nearly 25%, and applications were up more than 10% in those states. In your term, a product that rewards safe drivers with financial benefits expanded to four additional states, more than 22,000 drivers have registered for your turn in eight states, where it is now offered. Providing customers with greater digital capabilities while maintaining Erie's distinctive human touch continues to be a critical objective. The launch of our new mobile app in September was an important advancement in this area, and it is quickly gathering popularity with customers. More than 75,000 customers downloaded the app in the first three months after its launch. We also expanded our digital capabilities and created greater efficiencies with two new claims tools. Preferred method of inspection uses artificial intelligence to determine the best method of inspection for vehicles, and photo appraisal allows customers to upload pictures of vehicle damage using a mobile device. Both capabilities allow our employees and agents to work smarter and faster, so they can focus on providing a human touch where and when it is needed most. The advancements made during the past year demonstrate our commitment to strengthening our competitive position, creating new sources of revenue and meeting the challenging needs of our customers. It is also a testament to the strong relationships among our employees and agents, which have allowed us to work together seamlessly and be highly productive even at a very different and sometimes challenging environment. The relationships we share with our independent agents are critical to our success, and our annual branch meetings have been an important opportunity to recognize and connect with our agency force for more than 80-years. In 2020, we continued that tradition, just in a different way, nearly 4,500 agents and employees turned in to 18 live virtual events held in October. Just like we do at the inversion events, we reflected on the successes of the year and what is ahead on or award recipients and even had a little fun. While we all miss shaking hands and catching up in person, this spirit of coming together to celebrate our mutual achievements was very much alive at each event. Before I close, I would like to mention a couple of third-party recognitions here received in the fourth quarter of 2020. In October, we received certification as a 2021 Great Place To Work. The designation from Great Places To Work Institute was based on the results of an employee engagement survey conducted in September. It showed that 93% of employees consider Erie to be a great place to work compared to 59% at a typical U.S-based company. In other employer accolades, Forbes named Erie to its list of America's best large employers for 2021, ranking 395 out of 500. Erie is also named Penn State University's Corporate Partner Of The Year in October. The annual award celebrates corporate partners that have demonstrated exceptional commitment and promotion and support and state. Excellent track records, philanthropy and research and active engagement with students and alumni in the workplace and the classroom. And Erie continues to exceed industry and J.D. Power's 2020 Auto Claims Satisfaction study released in October. Our overall satisfaction score of 880 on a 1,000 point scale was eight points above the industry average. We exceeded the industry average in eight of the top 10 key performance indicator categories and scored in the top 10 for first notice of loss, claim servicing, estimation process and settlement. While we all set out to be recognized, these recognitions are not to our enduring commitment to our core values, being above all in service, practicing the golden rule and living the Erie Family spirit. As we begin 2021, our 96th year in business, I would like to once again thank our employees and agents for their dedication and resiliency over the past year and our shareholders who have continued support and trust. The strength and stability of this company, even uncertain times, is truly remarkable, and we couldn't do it without the confidence you place in us. Thank you all for your continued interest in Erie. I hope you and your loved ones stay well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. End of Q&A:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : [Call Starts Abruptly] \u2026following the recording. Now I would like to introduce your, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for the recorded discussion about our 2021 First Quarter Results. This recording includes remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company\u2019s current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors may cause these differences, please see the Safe Harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC, dated April 29, 2021, and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will now move on to Tim\u2019s remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. Last week, we held our annual meeting with shareholders, which was conducted virtually for the second time in the company\u2019s 96-year history. That\u2019s something we never expected to do more than once after shifting formats in 2020 due to the pandemic. COVID-19 has affected our lives for much longer than any of us anticipated, but we are hopeful that brighter days are ahead and some semblance of a return to normal activity is not too far in the offing. That normalcy includes our efforts to begin returning more employees to the workplace in line with safety considerations and productivity advantages. Turning to our first quarter, I\u2019m pleased to report that even after the most tumultuous year, we delivered solid financial results and are well-positioned to continue that strong performance again in 2021. As you saw in our press release filed after the market closed yesterday Erie Indemnity reported net income of $74 million or $1.41 per diluted share for the first quarter. This is compared to a net income of $59 million or $1.13 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. In the first three months of 2021, we grew premium by 1.7%. This increase was largely driven by strong retention and growth in total policies in force by 2.8%. The continued impact of the pandemic on driving behaviors and puce of your weather events and our footprint contributed to an outstanding first quarter combined ratio of 87.3%. Well, this positions us well going into the rest of the year. It\u2019s important to note that we expect combined ratio will normalize as the economy recovers and driving returns to more historic levels. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg to expand our first quarter results. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to be a part of Erie Indemnity\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. I am excited to share with you our financial performance for the quarter. As Tim mentioned, last week we held our 2021 annual shareholders meeting. Although this year\u2019s meeting was again held in a virtual setting, we established a connection with our shareholders by sharing the many ways we maintained our human touch and a year the challenge that objective immensely. And today, I look forward to connecting with you and sharing our success during the first quarter. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the first quarter was 1.7%, new business premiums increased 19.7% in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, while the average premium per policy on new and renewal policies decreased 1.5% driven by the rate reductions on personal and commercial auto policies that began in the third quarter of 2020. Exchange\u2019s combined ratio for the quarter was 87.3% and policy holder surplus remains very strong at $11.3 billion, up from $10.7 billion at the end of 2020. Shifting our attention to Indemnity. First quarter 2021 net income was $74 million or $1.41 per diluted share, compared to $59 million or $1.13 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. Operating income decreased nearly $10 million or 11.2% in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the first quarter of 2020. Indemnity\u2019s management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $12 million or 2.7% to nearly $456 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the first quarter of 2020. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services was nearly flat $15 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. Turning to Indemnity\u2019s cost of operations related to policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $9 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. This was the result of the 1.7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, primarily in lines of business that pay a higher commission rate. And to a lesser extent from increased agent incentive compensation. Non-commission expense increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Information technology costs increased $4 million, primarily due to increased hardware and software costs as well as increased professional fees. Administrative and other expenses increased $9 million, primarily driven by increased professional fees and an increase in incentive plan accruals tied to improved performance metrics in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of last year. Income from investments before taxes totaled $18 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $9 million during the first quarter of 2020. We recognize $9 million in earnings on our limited partnerships in the first quarter of 2021, while first quarter 2020 results were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the financial markets. As you can tell from our report this morning, Indemnity is well positioned to face 2021 head on, and I look forward to sharing our success with you this year. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. As our financial results confirmed, we\u2019re off to a strong start again this year. On our last call, I talked about the many advancements made in 2020 to bolster our competitive position with a substantial focus on augmenting Erie\u2019s distinctive human touch to greater digital capabilities. In the first three months of 2021, that momentum continued. Online account launched in 2019 gives customers flexibility to do business with us in ways that are most convenient for them. And two new features released in March are further enhancing the customer experience. First, the new paperless billing feature allows customers to opt out of paper billing statements. This feature addresses customer preferences and will lead to a significant cost savings over time. It will also reduce waste and supports our commitment to being a good steward of environmental resources. Customers can also now store payment information securely in their online account digital wallet. This means, they no longer need to reenter a credit card number or other payment method each time they pay, making future payments faster and easier. We continue to expand the use of telematics in response to consumer demand. In March, your turn, our telematics program expanded into Pennsylvania. The program, which tracks driving behaviors and reward safe drivers, already available to drivers in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin and West Virginia. More than 27,000 drivers, including me and my wife are now registered on Erie\u2019s platform. Our progress in the first quarter comes on the heels an impressive year of product enhancements made in 2020. Together, we anticipate they will strengthen our competitive position in the marketplace, boost our value proposition with customers and reinforce our relationship with the dedicated independent agents, who represent Erie. The results of our recent agent satisfaction survey show that we\u2019re on the right track on all fronts. This year survey received an unprecedented 99% response rate and satisfaction ratings are up significantly, both overall and across every factor measured in the survey. Agents overall satisfaction with Erie reached an all time high of 8.7 out of 10. And new to the survey this year, agents were asked to rate Erie\u2019s value proposition, they gave our value proposition and impressive rating of nine. This valuable feedback from our agents reaffirms how committed they are to our shared success. And it will without a doubt lead to even greater collaboration and stronger partnerships moving forward. Before we close, I\u2019d like to announce third-party recognition that Erie received just last week. Forbes has named us to its list of America\u2019s best employers for diversity in 2021. And I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019re ranked 18th out of 500 companies. This is an exciting recognition and a testament to our ongoing efforts to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace. Nevertheless, there is most companies in America now recognize a lot more needs to be done. We are committed to continuing this important work in the best interest of our investors, employees, and the communities we serve. As always, I\u2019d like to express my gratitude to our employees and agents, their commitment to being above all in service and to our shareholders for their continued support and trust. Thank you for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2021 second quarter results.

This prerecorded call is a property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the second quarter of 2021. Over the past several weeks, many of us have started to return to a more normal way of living. And with that, we're also starting to return to a normal way of working. In early July, we began returning more employees to our offices for the first phase of our workplace reset initiative. Phase two is set to begin in September with a significantly greater number of returning employees. Many of those employees will be among the first to work in our new seven-story office building, which we're planning to dedicate in September after a 17-month delay. The building is spectacular, and I can't wait to see it filled with activity. As we move through this phased return to our workplace and pilot new ways of working, it's important to note that we'll be learning and adapting as we go. One of the biggest lessons learned over the past 1.5 years is that the human touch transcends physical location. So just as we've been doing since the early days of the pandemic, we're committed to taking a thoughtful and deliberate approach to our decisions. As we pioneer what's next for our workforce delivery, our special culture and unique service model remains at the forefront of everything we do. Turning to our second quarter. I'm excited to announce an exciting milestone with a sure symbol of our continued stability and growth, six million policies in force. We certainly could not have reached this milestone without our hard-working agency force and dedicated sales and underwriting teams. Our study as you will approach to pricing and commitment to long-term profitability positions us well for continued growth as we look to seven million policies in force and a century of service. We had a remarkable first quarter of the year, and I'm pleased to report that those strong financial results are holding steady as we reach the halfway point of 2021. As you saw in our press release filed after the market close yesterday, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $79 million or $1.51 per diluted share for the second quarter. This is compared to a net income of $82 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. In the second quarter of 2021, we grew premium by 3.4%. This increase was largely driven by strong retention and an increase in new written premium of almost 40%. Losses remain at lower-than-normal levels due to a relatively mild spring and continued reduction in driving to the pandemic, contributing to a combined ratio of 92.6% year-to-date. Now I will turn the call over to Greg to expand on our second quarter results. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity second quarter earnings call. As the country continues to move to a more normal way of living, Erie is continuing to see this reflected in our financial results. We are seeing new business growth, but along with that, we are also seeing an increase in claims frequency. That being said, claims activity is still below pre-pandemic levels. You will see, as I share with you the financial results, that Erie remains well positioned for success going forward. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the second quarter was 3.4%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which climbed almost 40% over the prior year. With a combined ratio for the quarter of 97.7%, the Exchange's policyholder surplus grew to $11.7 billion, up $400 million from March 31. Now shifting to Indemnity. In the second quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $79 million or $1.51 per diluted share compared to $82 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. For the first half of 2021, net income was $153 million or $2.92 per diluted share compared to $141 million or $2.70 per diluted share in the first half of 2020. Operating income decreased 6.7% or $6 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Indemnity also saw a decrease in operating income of 8.9% or $16 million for the first six months of this year compared to the first six months of last year. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $18 million or 3.8% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. While for the first six months of 2021, Indemnity saw an increase of $30 million or 3.3% compared to the first half of 2020. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services decreased $146,000 in the second quarter and was flat in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period last year. Turning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $15 million in the second quarter and $24 million for the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange and, to a lesser extent, by the increase in agent incentive compensation related to more profitable growth. Non-commission expenses increased $9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Information technology costs increased by $3 million, driven by increases in hardware and software costs as well as increased personnel costs. Underwriting and policy processing expenses also increased $3 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs. Lastly, administrative and other expenses increased $4 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, driven by increased building and equipment depreciation and professional fees. For the first six months of 2021, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expenses of nearly $21 million, driven by increases in technology costs of $7 million, underwriting and policy processing expenses of nearly $3 million as well as administrative and other costs of $12 million, primarily driven by increased personnel costs and professional fees compared to the same period in 2020. Income from investments before taxes totaled $16 million in the second quarter and $34 million in the first six months of 2021. The results were primarily driven by equity and earnings of limited partnerships of $6 million and $15 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2021, respectively. I will remind you that the limited partnership asset class is in runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first six months of 2021, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $96 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. Despite the many challenges faced by our agents and employees over the past 18 months, we haven't missed a beat when it comes to productivity and growth. Our teams continue to execute on initiatives that will make a positive difference for our agents and customers this year and beyond. For over a year, we've been developing and refining the strategy that will bolster our competitive position, focused on expanding our digital capabilities while leveraging Erie's distinctive human touch. That means further strengthening the distinct relationship we have with our agents and broadening our shared digital presence to engage with customers wherever they are using the methods they prefer. Because our agents are critical to the success of this strategy, continuing to grow and nurture our agency force is a top priority moving forward. The newly formed agent recruiting and performance team is focused on just that, recruiting, onboarding and developing new agents and providing ongoing training and support to established agents. Most importantly, the team will be doing so in a way that's right for Erie, making sure that new agents are aligned with our values and share our commitment to service. In recent product developments, we have refreshed our Erie personal umbrella product and pricing, and it's creating tremendous results so far. Umbrella coverage provides protection beyond what auto and home insurance policies cover, and the refreshed product has been rolled out in 10 states. Companywide, new business direct written premium for personal umbrella is up more than 50% year-to-date. Our goal is to have the product in all of our states by the end of 2021. We recognize that a key part of supporting our customers and agents include supporting the communities where we do business, and several recent outreach efforts speak to that ongoing commitment. In April, we introduced new grant opportunities ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 for nonprofits in our hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania that focus on school readiness and after-school activities for children. In May, we announced a $100,000 investment in the minority community investment coalition to support outreach initiatives focused on improving health equity in Erie. Additionally, we awarded $100,000 to 10 nonprofits in Erie and Allentown, Pennsylvania in May through our 2020 Charity Challenge. Though the golf events were canceled last year due to the pandemic, team captains who participated in 2019 voted on nonprofits to share those funds. We're delighted that this year's tournaments will be held as scheduled later this summer. Before we close, I want to share a few accolades earned by Erie since our last call. First, Erie moved up an impressive 29 spots in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest American corporations from 376 to 347 based on total revenue from the 2020 fiscal year. Our ranking among this prestigious group for the past 18 years speaks to Erie's strong financial position and commitment to service. J.D. Power also recognized us in two recent studies. Erie was ranked first for customer satisfaction in the North Central region in the 2021 auto insurance study. In addition, Erie was ranked third for overall customer satisfaction in the midsized automobile insurer segment of the J.D. Power 2021 Insurance Shopping Study. Finally, I'm very pleased to share that Erie's first notice of loss team earned recertification from BenchmarkPortal. This is one of the most respected awards in the customer service and support industry and reflects the team's hard work, commitment and collaboration. As always, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees and agents for their commitment to being above all in service and to our shareholders for their continued support and trust. Thank you all for listening in today and for your interest in Erie. End of Q&A:",

This call was pre-recorded and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2021 third quarter results.

These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott. Thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the third quarter of 2021. In our last call, I discussed our plans to begin returning significant numbers of employees to our offices in September. However, as the delta variant spread presenting new challenges and uncertainties, we made the decision to pause those plans until January of 2022. Returning more employees back to our offices is important to our close net relationship-based culture and we're eager to do so. But ensuring the health and safety of our employees and communities while maintaining business continuity remains the top priority. One decision we did move ahead on was the historic and long anticipated dedication of Erie's new 7-story office tower. The Thomas B. Hagen Building appropriately named for our esteemed Chairman of the Board is an impressive addition to our home office campus and to the city of Erie. This occasion was delayed by 17 months due to the pandemic. However, the dedication date of September 15 was significant. It was the 68th anniversary of the day Tom Hagen joined Erie Insurance as a part-time file clerk while attending college. Tom, of course, is one of my predecessors in the CEO office. And since 2007, he has served as the Chairman of Erie Indemnity. Tom's influence and contributions as an Erie CEO, a businessman, philanthropist, preservationist and historian are evident across the city. And his wisdom and leadership have helped Erie Insurance grow into the thriving company it is today. The Hagen Building is a monumental symbol of that continued growth and success and of our hope for the future. When the building was designed, it was targeted to provide relief to expanding employee ranks, supporting our robust business growth. In the workplace reset underway, the building provides us ample space and an inspiring environment for new safe ways to come together. We're targeting January to start the return of our workforce to on-site locations. That return is marked by greater flexibility and empowerment and deference to our relationship culture and the changing nature of work. Now, let's turn to our third quarter financial results. As you saw in our press release filed after the market closed yesterday, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $90 million or $1.72 per diluted share for the third quarter. This is compared to a net income of $89 million or $1.71 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. I'd now like to invite Greg Gutting to share a deeper review of the financials. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity Third Quarter Earnings Call. I am proud to be here today to share with you our strong financial performance for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2021. With that, I'd like to share with you our third quarter results. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct written premium growth the third quarter was 3.8%, driven by growth in both our homeowners and commercial multi-peril products. During the third quarter, the Exchange experienced an increase in frequency in auto and increased severity in both auto and property, reflecting the driving activity resuming to nearly a pre-pandemic level and the increased cost of automobile, parts and building supplies. The exchange also experienced an increase in weather related losses in the third quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 110.6% which increased the combined ratio to 98.7% for the first nine months of 2021. The exchange surplus remains very strong at $11.7 billion. Turning our attention to your company, Indemnity. In the third quarter, Indemnity's net income was $90 million or $1.72 per diluted share compared to $89 million or $1.71 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. For the first nine months of 2021, net income was $243 million or $4.64 [ph] per diluted share compared to $231 million or $4.41 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2020. Operating income before taxes decreased 1.2% or $1 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. Indemnity also saw a decrease in operating income before taxes of 6.2% or $17 million for the first nine months of this year compared to the same period in 2020. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $20 million or 4.2% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. While for the first nine months of 2021, Indemnity saw an increase of $51 million or 3.6% compared to the first nine months of 2020. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services decreased $400,000 in the third quarter and $500,000 in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Focusing on Indemnity's cost of operations, commissions increased $15 million in the third quarter and $39 million in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increases in commission in both the third quarter and year-to-date were driven by the growth in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange and to a lesser extent, the increase in agent incentive compensation. Non-commission expense increased $6 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. Information technology costs increased by $4 million, driven by increases in hardware and software expenses as well as personnel costs. Sales and advertising costs increased $1 million due to personnel costs. A point to note, all expense categories were impacted as it relates to personnel costs due to an increase in medical costs compared to 2020. This is true for both the third quarter as well as year-to-date as many electric procedures were delayed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first nine months of 2021, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expenses of nearly $27 million. Increases in technology costs of $11 million were driven by hardware and software costs as well as personnel costs. Administrative and other expenses increased almost $13 million in the first nine months, driven by increases in building and equipment depreciation, professional fees and personnel costs. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased nearly $3 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs. Income from investments before taxes totaled $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $55 million year-to-date for 2021 which included income from limited partnerships of $12 million and $27 million, respectively. Limited partnerships were the largest contributor to investment income in both the quarter and year-to-date. I will remind you that limited partnership asset class is in runoff and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. In closing, the Indemnity Company is continuing to perform through the uncertain times of pandemic and it is this performance that has allowed us to pay our shareholders nearly $145 million in dividends this year. Thank you again for your time today. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. It's hard to imagine where we'd be if not for the technology that's allowed us to transcend physical location to connect and collaborate virtually for more than 1.5 years. This has not only opened our eyes to a new world of work but to the new demands of doing business. Something that's become very clear is that being fully present and operational in the digital space is critical. Consumers are more reliant on digital commerce than ever before. They've grown to expect the same level of ease in doing business with their insurance provider as they do with their favorite online retailer. What's different about Erie is the human touch that has been our differentiator and source of success for nearly a century. It's core to who we are and how we operate and that will never change. That's why we're focused on a strategy that embraces technology in a way that gives customers access to digital tools when they want it and contact with the person when they need it. The self-service capabilities offered through online account are a great example of that, including the new chat functionality. The chat function was first piloted last year with phased rollouts continuing into 2022. An online accounts paperless billing option introduced in March is approaching 100,000 policies enrolled. Another recent example of digital enablement, our claims handlers now have the ability to contact claimants by text message. We're seeing great initial usage rates for this service with the claims team engaging in more than 16,000 tax conversations per month since July and 72% of applicable customers opting in. These numbers are a strong indication that sometimes the human touch means meeting people where they are and communicating in the method they prefer. That outside-in approach to service delivery and product development, using customer data to drive our strategic priorities across the enterprise is key to our strategy moving forward. This will ensure that we deliver seamless customer experiences that are highly satisfying and provide agents with data-tested products and services to help them grow their businesses. Two expected product enhancements for 2022 support our growth objectives. On the commercial side, we're rolling out expanded cybersecurity coverage to be quoted on all new ErieSecure business policies. This comprehensive endorsement will provide first and third-party coverage of digital attacks like data breaches and computer fraud. For personal lines, we're rolling out extended water or flood coverage early in 2022. Using underwriting and pricing sophistication, we'll be able to manage our exposures and price risks properly to offer this coverage to customers who may benefit from it. Growing and preparing our workforce for the future is another area of focus as we move forward and implementing more inclusive and equitable recruiting strategies is a key component of that. As part of this journey to build a more diverse workforce, we're proud to be collaborating with The Precisionists, an organization focused on employment for people with disabilities. With them, we are piloting a program that leverages the talents of adults with autism. 80% of adults with autism in the U.S. are unemployed or underemployed, according to The Precisionists. Yet when properly assessed and trained, people with autism and other neuro diversities are extremely high-performing employees. Individuals in the pilot program are identified, assessed, trained and employed by The Precisionists, to engage as consultants and project-based work as members of our teams in data, human resources and information technology. This partnership promises to be a win-win, helping Erie build a more diverse workforce while making a positive difference in the lives of these talented individuals. I'm also proud to report that Erie was honored with several third-party recognition since our last call. Independent agents ranked Erie first among personal lines insurers in J.D. Power's 2021 U.S. Independent Agent Performance and Satisfaction Survey. Newsweek named Erie one of America's best customer service companies for 2022, ranking us fourth in the homeowners insurance category. U.S. News & World Report ranked Erie third in it's Best Renters Insurance Companies 2021, calling out Erie's competitive pricing, A+ rating from A.M. Best and policy features, such as personal property coverage, loss of use coverage, personal liability and guest medical coverage. Forbes listed Erie as a top company in five different personal insurance categories in it's 2022 list of America's best insurance companies. And Forbes also named Erie to it's list of America's Best-In-State Employer for 2021 in Pennsylvania. And finally, the Global ERG network, the world's largest network of employee resource groups and diversity councils, recognized Erie's African American Affinity Network and Dignity and Respect Affinity Network with a Top 25 ERG Diversity Impact Award. And Fred Johnson, Vice President and Manager of Wisconsin branch was one of five recipients of the Diversity Impact Executive Sponsor of the Year honor. Fred is the sponsor of Erie's African American Affinity Network. Before we close, I'd like to acknowledge two changes to our executive team. Dionne Wallace Oakley, former Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Strategy, announced her decision to resign from Erie in July to pursue another executive career opportunity in Washington, D.C. area. We are deeply grateful for Dionne's leadership, expertise, creativity and the perspective she shared during her career with Erie which span more than a decade. Human Resources Senior Vice President, Sean Dugan, has taken on oversight of the collective areas of responsibility, HR, strategy, strategic communications and employment and privacy and is reporting directly to me as we determine next steps for this role. And Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer, Bob Ingram, shared his plans to retire at the end of this year. Bob joined Erie in August of 2012 and under his leadership, Erie has achieved numerous technology gains with our agents customers and employees. These accomplishments have given Erie a solid foundation for continued success in the years ahead. Bob's early notice provided time to begin an internal and external search for his replacement which is currently underway. We thank both Bob and Dionne for their significant contributions to the organization and wish them all the best in their new chapters. As always, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees and agents for their commitment to being above all in service and to our shareholders for their continued support and trust. Thank you all for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. End of Q&A:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Erie Indemnity Company Fourth Quarter and Year End 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. You may begin, sir. Scott Beilharz : Thank you. And welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our 2021 fourth quarter and year-end results. This recording includes remarks from Timothy G. NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the Company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.  For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-K filing with the SEC dated February 24th, 2022 and the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim. Timothy G. NeCastro: Thanks, Scott. And thanks to all of you for taking the time to learn more about Erie's performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 and our year-end results. After working through the daunting challenges of 2020, we entered 2021 with a sense of hope for a return to normalcy and answers to the unknown. The pandemic, however, has persisted far longer than we could've imagined, and the challenges and uncertainties related to it continued and evolved as well. Against that backdrop, our performance in 2021 reflects its share of accomplishments, milestones, and points of pride. Among them, reaching 6 million policies in force for Erie Insurance Exchange. This can be credited in large part to our hard-working agency force and dedicated sales mentoring teams. Our steady as you go approach to pricing and commitment to long-term profitability has helped us surpass this milestone and positions us for continued growth. As we move towards 7 million policies in force and a century of service. The year also brought a significant moment in the Company's history. The dedication of our new seven story office building. The Thomas B. Hagen Building, named of course, for our Chairman of the Board is a symbol of pride and hope both for Erie, the Company and Erie, the city. It provides us ample space and an inspiring environment for new, safe ways to come together we begin returning more employees to our offices. We're no longer predicting a date for that return. However, logistical plans are complete to bring employees back when it's considered safe to do so. Our transition will reflect the nature of how we work and do business as changed during the pandemic. Wherever possible, employees love greater flexibility, balanced with the personal face-to-face interactions that have shaped our service culture for 97 years.  We're looking forward to pioneering what's next with and for our workforce. And in a way that's right for Erie and for our employees. Before I share some additional updates and achievements from this past year, let's turn to our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Despite the unique challenges faced over the past year in the industry, the country and the world. We're in a strong place financially and well-positioned for success as we move into 2022. As reported in our press release filed after the market closed yesterday, Erie Indemnity reported net income of $55 million or a $1.05 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, that was a decrease of approximately $8 million. During the first half of the year. Insurance losses remains at lower-than-normal levels to the relatively mild spring and continued reduction in driving due to the pandemic.  However, that shifted in the second half of 2021 as driving returned to nearly pre -pandemic level and supply chain issues led to dramatically increase costs for automobile parts and building supplies. More weather-related losses in the third quarter were then compounded by the catastrophic tornadoes in Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio in December. These factors contributed to a year-end combined ratio 103.9 compared to 93.7 at the end of 2020. Growth in our investment portfolio enabled us to grow policyholder surplus for the Exchange to $11.7 billion up a little over $1 billion for the year. It's worth noting that just over the past five-years, surplus has grown by $4 billion. Now, with that, I will pass it to Greg for deeper review of the financials. Greg. Greg Gutting : Thank you Sam. As I am sure you have noticed in your daily lives, the cost of just about everything has increased. As an insurance Company, we're seeing these rising costs in automobile replacements, car parts, and building material costs, which directly impact claims costs. We're also seeing driving activity returned to near pre -pandemic levels. These factors can certainly apply pressured to the bottom line. However, we've managed to yet again deliver strong financial results. I am proud to share those results with you today. Starting with the exchange the insurance operations we've manage. Direct written premium growth for the fourth quarter was 4.5% driven by an increase in the average premium per policy and increased policy retention.  For the year, the exchange saw an increase in direct written premiums of over 3% compared to 2020. The increase was driven by strong new policy growth of 9% and an increase in new direct written premium of just over 13% combined with increased policy retention. As Tim previously mentioned, the fourth quarter was impacted heavily by weather events in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio incentive fee. Despite these events, the Exchange Group policyholder surplus by $80 million landing at $11.7 billion at the end of 2021. This represents an increase of $1 billion for the year, driven by superior investment returns. Turning to the results for Indemnity, net income was $55 million or $1.05 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $63 million or $1.20 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020.  2021, total year net income was $298 million or $5.69 per diluted share compared to $293 million or $5.61 per diluted share in 2020. Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased just over $3 million or 4.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. From a total year perspective, Indemnity experienced a decrease in operating income of $20 million or 5.9% compared to 2020. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased nearly $21 million or 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and $71 million or 3.9% for the total year compared to 2020. The increases in both the fourth quarter and total year were driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange. The total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $23 million for the fourth quarter and over $88 million for the total year, 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020. Commission expenses for the fourth quarter grew $18 million, while the total year commission expense increased $57 million. The fourth quarter was impacted mainly by the growth in the direct and assumed written premiums. However, our total year commission expense was driven by two factors. The increase in written premiums, as well as higher agent incentive compensation. Turning to our non-commission expenses. For the fourth quarter, Indemnity saw an increase of nearly $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter increase was driven by increases in underwriting and policy processing costs, administrative and other expenses, and customer service costs. For the total year 2021, non-commission expenses grew by $31 million compared to 2020.  Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $4.5 million, driven by personnel costs, as well as underwriting report costs. IT costs grew roughly $11 million due to increased software and hardware costs, as well as personnel costs. And finally, administrative and other expenses increased just over $14 million driven by professional fees and building and equipment depreciation. Personnel costs and all categories were impacted by higher medical costs compared to the prior year as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced electric procedures in 2020. Indemnity's fourth quarter pre -tax income from investments totaled over $12 million. This represents a decrease of roughly $2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.  Although we saw an increase in limited partnership income of over $3 million, it was more than offset by a decrease in realized gains of nearly $5 million. Our investment income for the total year basis, however, is a very positive story. Indemnity total year pretax income from investments was just over $67 million, an increase of $34.5 million compared to 2020. The large increase is attributable to our limited partnership portfolio, which recorded earnings of $32 million in 2021. I will remind you that limited partnership asset class is in runoff and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. Finally, in 2021, we paid our shareholders dividend in the amount of a $193 million. Also, in December of last year, our board approved a 7.2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for both Class A and Class B shares for 2022. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Timothy G. NeCastro: Thanks, Greg. As Greg mentioned earlier in his remarks, we saw an impressive jump of 9% in new policies written in 2021. That increase can be largely attributable to some of the new and enhanced products in both personal and commercial lines. There's personal umbrella product, refresh and reintroduced across our footprint last year, provides protection beyond what auto and home insurance policies cover. In 2021, new business direct written premium for personal umbrella was up more than 30% versus 2020. ErieSecure business introduced in late 2020 is a customizable, commercial multi-peril products that agents quote on average in just over seven minutes. It exceeded the expectations last year generating nearly $200 million new written premiums and providing protection to more than 75,000 businesses. Along with new enhanced product offerings, we've been working over the past year to establish a strategy that keeps the human touch delivered by our agency force at the center while expanding our digital tools and services to meet customer demand. The same technology that's allowed us to connect and collaborate virtually over the past two years, has also changed the way consumers interact companies. It's critical that we embrace that shifts for technology, but it's even more critical to do that in a way that's distinctly [Indiscernible]. That means giving customers access to digital teams when they want it and contact with the person when they need it. Several enhancements to our online account platform in 2021 addresses that approach to convenience, customized service, and the initial usage numbers show that they're resonating with our customers. The new chat function with an online account so an average response time of just 16 seconds and 96% of chats were answered within 40 seconds. The new paperless billing option introduced to online account customers in March now has more than 100,000 policies enrolled. A new text messaging capability for claims handlers, seeing great usage rates with the claims team engaging are more than 16,000 text conversations per month and 72% of applicable customers opting in. Another aspect of our strategy is using customer data to drive our approach to service delivery and product development. This will ensure that we deliver seamless customer experiences and provide agents with data-tested products and services to help grow their business. One way we're doing this is through your turn, our Telematics program attracts driving behaviors and reward safe drivers.  Pennsylvania was added as the eighth state in our footprint to offer low term in 2021. And now nearly 50,000 drivers are registered on Erie's platform. We're also anticipating two new product enhancements to meet customers needs. Expanded commercial cyber security coverage to be quoted on all new ErieSecure business policies and extended water or flood coverage for personalized customers. Overall, these advancing demonstrate our commitment to strengthening our competitive position, meeting the challenging needs and preferences of our customers, and building on the service products that's been the source of our success for 97 years. That commitment to service was affirmed recently by a second place ranking from J.D. Power in their 2021 Auto Claims Satisfaction Study released in November.  Erie score jumped by 21 points from 2020 and was just four points shy of the first-place spot. Additionally, Erie was the highest performer for the estimation process and tied for first for clean servicing. Erie was also included in the top ten carriers for customers experience with first notice of loss, settlement and rental experience. This recognition along with the accomplishments in the past year are testament to the strong relationships among our employees and agents which have allowed us to work together seamlessly and to be highly productive even in the very different and often challenging environment we face over the past two years. That Erie family spirit is also helps us in weather storms like the [Indiscernible] tornadoes and torquing parts of our footprint in December.  The displays of humanity shown by our employees and agents were nothing short of remarkable. And also, serve as a reminder of our purpose, to provide our policy holders with this near perfect protection as near-perfect service, as humanly possible to do so at the lowest possible cost. I'd like to once again thank our employees and agents for their dedication and our shareholders for their continued support and trust, and all of you for your continued interest in Erie. End of Q&A: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Erie Indemnity Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you and welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our first quarter results. This recording includes remarks from Timothy NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the Safe Harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC dated April 28th, 2022 and the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks Scott and good morning, everyone. Earlier this week, we held our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. We broadcast the meeting from the new Thomas B. Hagen building, which as I mentioned on previous calls, was dedicated last September. This beautiful building has continued to sit mostly empty since that time as the majority of our employees have continued to work remotely. However, just in the past couple of weeks, that started to change. We celebrated Erie's 97th anniversary on April 20th by welcoming nearly 200 employees back to our home office campus. They joined the essential employees who have been coming into the office to maintain operations since the beginning of the pandemic. This is the beginning of a broader phase-in return to our offices that will be taking place over the next several months. We're returning with greater flexibility than ever before. But we're taking a slow and steady approach to ensure the spirit of the organization and levels of service are upheld as the pandemic continues its transition to new variants in a world anxious to return to living fully. At Erie, our focus now is less about getting back to what we previously knew and more about exploring what's next. We're positioning, learning, and adapting as we go and we'll be doing that together with our Erie employees. At the Annual Shareholder's Meeting, I also shared some of the external challenges we're facing, the inflation rate, supply chain issues, and labor shortages are being felt across all industries and they are further echoed in our industry through increased claims cost. Our combined ratio for the first quarter, which stands at 104.6% reflects some of those challenges. But I'm confident in Erie's financial strength evidenced by $11.5 billion in policyholder surplus and continued growth, which can be seen in the 7% direct written premium increase for the quarter. And of course, Erie's 97-year track record of stability and success is a testament to the adaptability and resilience to whatever the times may throw our way. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg for a deeper view of our first quarter financials. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks Tim. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. As Tim mentioned, earlier this week, we held our 97th Annual Shareholder's Meeting where we shared many of our distinguished accomplishments in 2021. We shared how several new products have positively impacted our insurance operations. We shared how changes in the way we interact and communicate with our customers has bolstered our customers overall experience. And lastly, we shared with our audience how even in the midst of a more difficult year, the Exchange still added $1 billion to policyholder surplus, further showing this strong financial performance can be achieved even during challenging times. Now, I would like to share with you the first quarter results for 2022. Beginning with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct and assumed written premium growth for the first quarter with 7%. This growth for the quarter was driven by a 4% increase in the new policy premiums as well as a 3% increase in total policies in force. The Exchange's combined ratio for the quarter was 104.6%, up significantly from the first quarter of 2021. The increase in the combined ratio can be attributed to the increase in auto claims frequency and severity, driven by higher claim settlement costs and driving activity at near pre-pandemic levels. Despite the increase in the combined ratio, the Exchange still recorded policyholder surplus of $11.5 billion at March 31st, 2022. Shifting our attention to Indemnity, first quarter 2022, net income was $69 million, or $1.31 per diluted share compared to $74 million or $1.41 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021. Operating income before taxes increased $8 million, or 10.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Indemnity's management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $32 million or 7.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services was $14 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $15 million in the first quarter of last year. Turning to Indemnity's cost of operations related to policy issuance and renewal services, commissions increased nearly $20 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This was the result of the 7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, primarily in lines of business that pay a higher commission rate. Non-commission expenses increased $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Sales and advertising increased nearly $2 million due to agent-related expenses, while administrative and other costs increased $3 million, primarily due to an increase in professional fees. Lastly, income from investments before taxes totaled $3 million for the quarter compared to $18 million during the first quarter of 2021. Included in our investment income was nearly $3 million of income from limited partnerships in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $9 million in limited partnership income in the first quarter of 2021. However, keep in mind that our limited partnership portfolio is still in runoff. Indemnity also recorded realized and unrealized losses of over $7 million in the first quarter of 2022, which negatively impacted total investment income. Thank you, again, for your time and attention this morning. I look forward to continuing to provide you with financial updates throughout 2022. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. We headed in the 2022 hoist implemented strategies we've spent over a year developing and refining. That strategy involves embracing technology in ways that are distinctly Erie by strengthening our most unique asset, relationship with our independent agency force. It also aims to strengthen our competitive position by making sure our independent agents are well-equipped to meet the changing needs and preferences of our customers. A perfect example of a product that addresses those changing needs is our commercial cyber suite coverage. This provides comprehensive protection against risks we couldn't imagine a few decades back, cyber-attacks to businesses. It's now available to commercial customers through Erie Secure business and automatically quoted on all new policies. There's a growing market addressing the emerging threats businesses face in this digital age and we see a lot of potential for this particular product. Also through Erie Secure business, a new wage and hour option within Employment Practices Liability covers defense costs for claims for the insured and their employee disagree about time paid. These defense costs can present a real exposure for small business clients and we're pleased to now offer this optional coverage. On the personal line side, we're addressing a previously unmet need by offering extended water or flood coverage. This coverage which includes both sewer drain and flood coverage under a single limit is now offered in four states with plans to roll it out to most of our states by the end of this year. Another way we're meeting both customer and agent needs is through the service capabilities we provide. Our online account platform now has more than 900,000 active customers and live chat capabilities are now available to all customers that use it, giving them the option to have a real-time conversation with an Erie customer care representative online. More than 12,000 chats have been handled since the functionality was introduced. We're also pleased to now offer live interpretation services for our agents through a partnership with a service called Language Line Solutions. Agents can have clear professional conversations with any customer or prospect regardless of the language they speak. Agents simply call a number, choose from more than 200 languages and connect with a live interpreter at no charge. Along with service to our customers, we're also committed as always, to servicing our communities where we live and work. Erie recently selected 23 educational non-profits to receive more than $824,000 in funding for 2022 through Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program. Erie has donated nearly $10 million to the program since it was established in 2011. I'm also proud to announce two recent third-party recognitions. Erie was named Best of the Best by both the Hispanic Network Magazine and by the Black EOE Journal. Both publications promote diversity in all aspects of education, business, and employment to ensure equal opportunity, and we're excited to be recognized for our commitment to integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into our principles and practices. Finally, I'm very excited to share that after an extensive search, we've appointed the new Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer to replace Bob Ingram around who retired at the end of last year. Partha Srinivasa, who most recently served as Senior Vice President and Chief Data Officer at Verisk Analytics joined Erie on April 4. Verisk is one of the world's largest data analytics firms and Partha was responsible for the company's insurance segment, data and technology, as well as enterprise-wide data and analytics. Prior to Verisk, he held multiple technology leadership roles as a global CIO and CTO at companies including Zurich Financial Services, Tokio Marine, Farmers Insurance, and Safe Auto. Partha is highly respected IT executive and his experience is a perfect match for where we need to go as an organization and the critical role technology and data play in getting us there. He's also a positive open person who embraces and embodies Erie's unique values and culture. I'm so pleased to have Partha at the Executive table and know he'll do great things here in Erie. As always, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees and agents for their commitment to being above all in service and to our shareholders for their continued support and trust. Thank you for listening in today and your continued interest in Erie. End of Q&A: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of the Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim\u2019s remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for listening in today. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re already halfway through 2022. First half of the year was a time of transition and new beginnings. Back in April, we began bringing a small number of employees back to our home office. These employees volunteered to be the first to work on our new Thomas B. Hagen building and they have been pioneers in helping us shape the employee experience as we move into a new era of work. That new era began in July, as we started bringing 200 more employees back to work on site each week, a process we expect to continue for several more months. As we do this, we are finding a balance between flexibility, productivity and connectedness. Wherever possible, employees are working on hybrid schedule, with some days in the office and others remote. This allows employees to have the face-to-face interactions that are a key part of building strong relationships, while still giving them the flexibility they have come to value from working virtually. It\u2019s also the core of our business strategy, combining the human touch with an enhanced digital experience. With that said, we know many employees prefer the convenience of fully remote work. And without a doubt, the pandemic has only heightened the competition for talent and work opportunities. So while hybrid remains our preferred model, we are also taking initial steps to expand remote opportunities in target areas and job families facing challenges in recruiting and retention. We believe this move will ultimately help to alleviate some of our talent challenges, with minimal impact to our relationship-based culture. Talent is just one of the many challenges we and so many other companies are facing. The property and casualty insurance industry has been particularly affected by inflation. According to the Insurance Information Institute, replacement costs associated with homeowners and auto insurance, which are our largest lines, are up more than 10% over last year. We too are experiencing higher vehicle and building repair costs, sometimes exacerbated by longer times for repair. Disruptions in the supply chain for things like vehicle sensors are root cause of this. These inflationary cost increases are leading to higher claim severity than we contemplated in our pricing, driving a higher-than-expected combined ratio, which stands at 113.7 for the first half of 2022. Across the insurance sector, everyone is feeling the pinch. Where Erie differs however is in how we leverage the strength of our financial stability, thanks to our policyholder surplus, which stands at $10.6 billion. The other good news is in the strong premium growth we\u2019re seeing, which was 8.6% for the quarter. Overall, policies in force grew by 3.1% and our retention rate is also outstanding at 90.3% for personal and commercial lines combined. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Greg Gutting for a deeper review of our financials. Greg? Greg Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity Company second quarter earnings call. As you will see in the results I share with you today and as Tim mentioned earlier, Erie has not been immune to the inflationary conditions of our economy, which have had the most impact on the settling of auto and property claims. The second quarter of 2022 was impacted not only by the stormy weather experienced in June, but also by the increased severity in our auto and property claims. With that, I\u2019d like to jump into our results for the second quarter. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct written premium growth for the second quarter was 8.6%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which climbed 10.7% over the prior year. The increased loss severity driven by inflation, combined with storm losses, generated a combined ratio for the quarter of 122.4%. This, combined with the down financial markets, resulted in a $900 million decrease in the Exchange\u2019s surplus for the quarter. Despite these results, the Exchange recorded surplus of $10.6 million at June 30 and continues to maintain a very strong balance sheet. Turning our attention to Indemnity, in the second quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $80 million or $1.53 per diluted share compared to $79 million or $1.51 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. For the first half of 2022, net income was $149 million or $2.84 per diluted share, down slightly from the $153 million or $2.92 per diluted share recorded in the first half of 2021. Operating income increased 22.3% or $19 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Indemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 16.8% or $27 million for the first 6 months of this year compared to the first 6 months of last year. Indemnity\u2019s management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $42 million or 8.4% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021, while for the first 6 months of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase of $75 million or 7.8% compared to the first half of 2021. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services decreased $200,000 in the second quarter and $700,000 in the first half of 2022 compared to the same periods last year. Turning to Indemnity\u2019s cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $14 million in the second quarter and $34 million for the first 6 months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. Non-commission expense increased $9 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Information technology costs increased by $5 million, driven by increased hardware and software costs as well as increased professional fees. Also, administrative and other expenses increased over $5 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, driven by increased professional fees and increased personnel costs related to compensation. For the first 6 months of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expense of $14 million, driven by increases in technology costs of $4 million and administrative and other costs of $9 million. These increased costs were primarily driven by increases in hardware and software costs as well as professional fees compared to the same period in 2021. Investment losses before taxes totaled $2 million in the second quarter. And income from investments before taxes totaled $1 million in the first 6 months of 2022, down significantly from the same periods in 2021. This was driven by lower limited partnership earnings and realized and unrealized losses recorded in 2022. We recorded limited partnership earnings of $2.5 million in the first 6 months of 2022 compared to earnings of over $15 million in the same period in 2021. I will remind you that limited partnership asset classes and runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. Also, with market conditions down substantially in 2022, we incurred realized and unrealized losses of nearly $18 million in the first half of this year compared to gains of almost $4 million in 2021. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 6 months of 2022, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $103 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today. Now I will turn the call back over to Tim. Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. I mentioned earlier in the call that the core of our strategy combines the human touch with enhanced digital experience. That involves embracing technology in ways that are distinctly Erie by bolstering our unique asset, the relationship with our independent agency force. After more than 2 years of virtual meetings and celebrations, we\u2019ve been excited to reconnect with our agents in person over the past few months at annual branch meetings held across our footprint and at our combined agent task force meeting, which we hosted recently in our hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. Something we\u2019ve been discussing with agents is how we can make sure they are well equipped to meet the changing needs and preferences of our customers for new and enhanced products and services. The new extended water product for personal lines is one example of that. This represents Erie\u2019s entry into the private flood market, which includes sewer or draining backup coverage plus flood barrels under a single limit. Following a successful pilot in Indiana and Virginia earlier this year, we rolled it out to two more states, Tennessee and West Virginia, in June. It\u2019s already been added to more than 2,000 policies in those 4 states. We\u2019re also able to use data from this pilot to appropriately monitor our risk and roll out the coverage to additional states. On the services side, chat is now available to all users of our online account platform. Our digital services being handled over 15,000 chats through May of 2022 and more than 900,000 households now have an active online account. Capabilities of our mobile app were also recently strengthened by an integration with Safelite, Erie\u2019s third-party glass plane vendor. This allows users to be in an auto glass claim, which is a high-frequency claim occurrence directly from the app. Before we close, I\u2019d like to make a note of a few third-party recognitions. J.D. Power ranked Erie first in its 2020 U.S. auto insurance study in 2 regions : Mid-Atlantic and North Central. Ranking is based on customer satisfaction scores in billing, claims, interactions, policy offerings and price. In other recognitions, Forbes listed Erie on its 2022 list of America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity. Out of 500 companies recognized across all industries, Erie was ranked #48 nationally. Finally, Erie\u2019s First Notice of Loss department was named a top contact center in its size and category across all industries by BenchmarkPortal. In 2021, Erie\u2019s FNOL customer satisfaction rates improved nearly 90%, a reach significantly higher than the industry average. This commitment to a high level of service is what has always set Erie apart. We remain steadfast in that commitment, especially in these challenging and changing times. That\u2019s made possible by the dedication of our employees and agents. And it\u2019s reinforced by the ongoing support and trust of our shareholders. I\u2019d like to thank all of you for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Erie Indemnity Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no questions-and-answer session following the recording.  Now I'd like to introduce your host of the call today, Vice President, Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Your line is open. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com.  Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause these differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC dated October 27, 2022 and in the related press release.  This prerecorded call is the property of the Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of the Erie Indemnity Company.  With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to learn more about Erie's performance in the third quarter of 2022.  As we move into the last few months of the year, I'm excited to be doing so with more employees working and collaborating in our offices with many of our long-standing in-person events back in place. Nearly 70% of employees in position who've worked on-site before the pandemic have now returned to our offices, and those returns will continue into next year. Like many other companies, we're taking a hybrid approach, balancing the flexibility our employees have come to value over the past couple of years with the needs of our business and relationship-based culture.  The past few months also saw the return of many of the celebrations and gatherings that are so important to us at Erie. Events like our annual branch meetings to recognize our independent agents, service anniversary celebrations to honor our long-tenured employees and summer picnics to connect with colleagues were all resumed after more than 2 years of cancellations and shifts to virtual formats. We are also excited to introduce our inaugural Diversity Summit held in September, a week-long event featuring guest speakers, interactive sessions and live panel discussions all designed to further engage employees and agents in our journey to integrate diversity, equity and inclusion into how we operate.  The Diversity Summit was a milestone in a year of significant progress, which included naming the company's first Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Lance Hyde brings more than 16 years of experience in diversity and inclusion practices, including supplier diversity and sustainability initiatives. He served as Director of Global Inclusion and Diversity at Koppers in Pittsburgh. Under the leadership of Lance and our Chief Diversity and Community Development Officer, Chris Marsh, we've moved into a phase of action, accountability and deepening of our commitment to making diversity, equity and inclusion operational at Erie.  Now let's turn to our third quarter financial results. We're with the rest of our industry and many others in facing continued challenges created by the inflationary environment. The combined ratio of 113.1% for the year reflects both high claims severity to declining repair and replacement costs for auto and property claims and an increase in weather-related losses. Weather event-related claims for the end of September were up 42% over last year and contributed 8.2% to the combined ratio. On the positive side, we continue to also see an upward trend in premium, which grew 9.4% for the quarter and is up 8.4% for the year. Overall policies in force are up 3.3% and our retention rate remains strong and over 90% for personal and commercial lines combined. Along with that, our policyholder surplus stands at almost $10.2 billion, allowing us to maintain our steady-as-we-go approach to pricing and profitability.  With that, I'll turn it over to Greg for a deeper review of our financials. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity Company third quarter earnings call.  2022 has been difficult. Growing inflation, coupled with unfavorable market conditions, has challenged not only our business but the insurance sector as a whole. Erie is not immune to these factors, but our tried and true business model continues to provide successful results as we face these challenges head on. I will begin my review with the results for the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct written premium growth for the third quarter was 9.4%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which climbed almost 21% over the prior year. With a combined ratio for the quarter of 111.9% and continued market volatility, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $10.2 billion, down $400 million [indiscernible]. Now shifting to Indemnity. In the third quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $84 million or $1.61 per diluted share compared to $90 million or $1.72 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2021. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, net income was $233 million or $4.46 per diluted share compared to $243 million or $4.64 per diluted share in the same period in 2021.  Operating income increased 12% or $11 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. Indemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 15% or $39 million for the first 9 months of 2022 compared to the same period last year.  Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $47 million or 9.3% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. For the first 3 quarters of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase of $121 million or 8.3% compared to the same period in 2021. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $200,000 in the third quarter but decreased $500,000 in the 3 quarters of 2022 compared to the same period last year.  Turning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $22 million in the third quarter and $56 million in the first 3 quarters of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increases in agent compensation in both periods was driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation.  Noncommission expense increased $14 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $3 million, primarily due to increased postage and underwriting report costs. Information technology costs increased $4 million driven by increased professional fees and hardware and software costs, partially offset by decreased personnel costs. Also, administrative and other expenses increased $6 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, driven by increased personnel costs related to compensation and increased professional fees.  For the first 9 months of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase in noncommission expenses of $28 million, driven by increases in underwriting and policy processing costs of $3 million, information technology costs of $8 million, sales and advertising costs of $3 million and administrative and other costs of $15 million compared to the same period in 2021.  Investment losses before taxes totaled $1 million in the third quarter, and income from investments before taxes totaled $300,000 year-to-date 2022. The results were primarily driven by equity and losses of limited partnerships of $5 million and $2 million in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022 compared to limited partnership earnings of $12 million in the third quarter and $27 million for the first 9 months of 2021. I will remind you that limited partnership asset class is in runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future.  Investment income was also negatively impacted by realized and unrealized losses of $24 million for the first 9 months of 2022 compared to gains of $5 million for the same period last year. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management and we maintain a strong balance sheet, and for the first 9 months of 2022, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $155 million in dividends.  Thank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Greg. At Erie, we've always had a strong culture of innovation, one that goes back nearly 100 years. Erie Insurance began from a prospectus written on a 10-cent tablet. And our founders, H.O. Hirt and OG. Crawford, hit the street to raise more than $30,000 over 3 months from 90 different investors. That forward-looking spirit endures. Today, it's represented by a slate of efforts aimed at generating new revenue opportunities in a dynamic marketplace.  In recent years, we've invested in promising businesses through both opportunities on funding in Erie Pittsburgh and Baltimore and in early-stage tech companies through our next-level innovation efforts. And in August, we announced the launch of an exciting new investment fund, Erie Strategic Ventures, as our new corporate venture capital investment arm. The focus of the fund will be on businesses tied to the personal and commercial insurance value chain as well as natural adjacencies. This could include companies that are innovating in areas like risk avoidance, claims or digital sales.  The goal is to make will enhance Erie's existing value proposition, support our independent agents and allow Erie to explore new growth opportunities that complement our business model.  We're partnering with Touchdown Ventures, an experienced corporate venture capital firm, to strategize and manage these investments. We're looking forward to building on our innovation efforts with the launch of this venture fund and to do so in a way that aligns with our values and our dedication to service.  Before we close, I'd like to make note of a few third-party recognitions. Two of those recognitions came from Forbes. Erie was named to its list of America's Best-in-State Employers for 2022 and America's Best Insurance Companies for 2023. The Best-in-State Employers list is based on recommendations from employees who are asked to rate their willingness to recommend their employers to friends and family. Erie is ranked among the top 25 employers in Pennsylvania on that list. The Best Insurance Companies list recognized Erie as an industry leader in 5 product categories : auto, homeowners, renters, term life and permanent life.  And for the second consecutive year, Erie's Future Focus internship program was named to the Rising Insurance Star Executive list of the insurance industry's 50 best internship programs in 2022. The Future Focus program is one of our largest pipelines for early career talent and growing diversity within our talent pool. Erie hosted more than 100 interns in 2022, the largest class 20-year history. As we continue to face a competitive labor market, programs like this one are critical to our talent strategy to maintain and build a robust and diverse workforce at Erie.  As always, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees and agents for their commitment to being above all in service and to our shareholders for their continued support and trust. Thank you all for listening in today and for your interest and investment at Erie. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

    "content": "\ufeff Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our fourth quarter and year-end results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, insurance.com.

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior risk consent of the Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 and our year-end results. As you're all aware, we find ourselves at a time of historic economic challenges. Inflation, supply chain issues and labor shortages to name just a few of the challenges have put substantial pressure on our bottom line, which we'll cover in more detail in a few minutes. Fortunately, our perseverance through 98 years of stability is helping us adapt to and withstand the current financial climate. Our ability to adapt has also helped us transition to new ways of working over the past year. Throughout 2022, we returned employees and welcome new hires to our offices. We also began resuming the in-person gatherings that have either been canceled or shifted to a virtual format for more than 2 years during the height of the pandemic. It's been a learning experience as we've introduced greater flexibility in how and where people collaborate and connect. The majority of Erie employees are now working in a hybrid format, splitting their time between in-office and remote work. Many of our office spaces are now neighborhoods, a mixture of dedicated and flexible workspaces. And meeting rooms have been equipped with new technology that supports the experience of employees participating in both in person and virtually. It's clear that the world of work has changed significantly over the past 3 years, and the competition for talent continues. That's why gathering employee feedback is critical to making sure we're handling these returns the right way. We'll continue to learn and adapt to these new ways of working to ensure Erie remains an employer of choice in today's tight talent market while maintaining the culture, traditions and relationships that are so important to us and distinctive to our service brand. Before I share some additional updates from the past year, let's turn to our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. As I mentioned earlier, we are feeling the impact of the current economic climate, most notably in the combined ratio for Erie Insurance Exchange which was 116.1% for 2022 compared to 103.9% for 2021. While we saw claims frequency remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, we continue to see higher-than-usual severity. Auto repair costs are up 19.5% through December. The consumer price index was up 6.5% and more extreme weather events like hurricanes and owner storms are creating higher industry property losses. Like the rest of the industry, we've responded to these economic challenges through rate increases, which we're doing with a measured approach along with expense management, adhering to our strict underwriting guidelines and agency profitability reviews. In this continued hard market, we know more customers will shop. While customers may be looking for a more attractive price they also demand a superior value proposition. That's something that Erie offers, and we're pleased to see that reflected in our growth numbers. Our top line growth was strong this past year as premium growth climbed an impressive 9.2% and new business premium increased 14.5%. Overall, policies in force are up 3.6% and our retention rate remains strong at over 90% for personal and commercial lines combined. With that, I'll pass it to Greg for a deeper review of the financials. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. As Tim alluded to at the beginning of this discussion, the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, continues to see unprecedented loss costs related to claim severity driven by inflation. Because of this steep rise in claims cost, we have quickly adapted to become more agile, as in a way that still compels us to perform for our policyholders and agents. We have taken a more diligent approach to underwriting, and we've also taken a deeper look into our policy rate structures. All of these efforts are putting us in a position to deliver improved financial results as we are already seeing top line growth. The Exchange direct written premium growth for the fourth quarter was 12.1%, driven by an increase in the average premium per policy and increased policy retention. For the year, the Exchange saw an increase in direct written premiums of 9.2% compared to 2021. The increase was driven by strong new policy growth of 3.7% and an increase in new direct written premium of 14.5%, combined with increased policy retention. Turning to the results for indemnity. Net income was over $65 million or $1.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $55 million or $1.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. We 2022 total year net income was $299 million or $5.71 per diluted share compared to $298 million or $5.69 per diluted share in 2021. Operating income in the fourth quarter increased nearly $20 million or 31.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. From a total year perspective, Indemnity experienced an increase in operating income of $58 million or 18.3% compared to 2021. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased over $53 million or 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and almost $175 million or 9.1% for the total year compared to 2021. The increases in both the fourth quarter and total year were driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange. The total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $35 million for the fourth quarter and over $118 million for the total year 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Commission expenses for the fourth quarter grew $16 million while the total year commission expense increased $71 million. Similar to the management fees, the increase in both the fourth quarter and total year were driven by an increase in the direct and affiliated assumed written premiums. Turning to our noncommission expenses. For the fourth quarter, Indemnity saw an increase of over $19 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter increase was driven by increases in underwriting and policy processing costs, information technology costs, sales and advertising costs and administrative and other costs. For the total year 2022, noncommission expense grew by $47 million compared to 2021. Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $6 million, driven by personnel costs as well as underwriting report costs. Information technology costs grew $13 million due to increased hardware and software costs as well as personnel costs. Sales and advertising costs increased $7 million due to increased advertising and agent-related costs. And finally, administrative and other expenses increased nearly $23 million driven by personnel costs related to compensation and increased professional fees. Indemnity's fourth quarter pretax income from investments totaled $300,000. This represents a decrease of roughly $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease was driven by losses in limited partnership investments. Indemnity's total year pretax income from investments with just over $600,000, a decrease of $67 million compared to 2021. The large decrease is attributable to losses in our limited partnership portfolio of $10 million recorded in 2022 compared to earnings unlimited partnerships of $32 million recorded in 2021. Indemnity also incurred $27 million in realized and unrealized losses in 2022 compared to gains of $5 million recorded in 2021. I will remind you that the limited partnership asset classes and runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. Finally, in 2022, we paid our shareholders dividends in the amount of $207 million. Also in December of last year, our Board approved a 7.2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for both Class A and Class B shares for 2023. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. Technology has not only become vital to how our workforce connects, but it's also an integral part of how we do business. This isn't new to us, but the speed and focus of technology has certainly been heightened over the past 3 years. Erie's strategy in essence is to modernize our business model with greater digital capabilities while continue our investment in one of our most unique assets : our independent agency force. And because of the pace of technology, we're focused on acceleration and agility to get that strategic work done. This means working faster, working smarter and being nimble. It also means setting objectives and tracking key results to ensure we're hitting goals and time lines, engaging the effectiveness and success of our overall strategy. Not only will this allow us to modernize legacy platforms and bring new products and services to market more quickly, but shorter run times for major projects and initiatives will also lead to expense reductions. This accelerated agile approach was used to launch a recent pilot for a new online quoting and agent routing program called [ cold flow ]. This aims to capture more digital prospects through a more streamlined quoting process, combined with personal interaction with an Erie agent. It brings together the technology to meet customers where they are, with the human touch that differentiates Erie from the competition, which is exactly what our strategy is about. Following the pilot, we expect to expand the program to more agencies throughout 2023. We also continue to invest in our new and enhanced ways to serve our existing customers. Our online account platform, which acts as a digital self-service tool for customers is now used by more than 1 million households, and chat services have become a popular feature of the customer experience. More than 22,000 conversations were handled by digital services team last year, an increase of more than 200% over 2021. Based on recent survey data, customers rated the tool an average of 4.7 out of 5. 2 new products launched in 2022 are also showing promising early results. The combined Cyber Suite coverage, which protects businesses against cyber attacks, now covers more than 11,000 ErieSecure Business customers; and Extended Water Coverage, which was piloted in 2 states in early 2022 and roll off to 10 states within our footprint in the second half of the year, has been added to nearly 14,000 policies so far, protecting customers against certain types of water damage. As we've always done, we're developing and refining these new products and services alongside our independent agents. The relationship we have with our agency force is unparalleled. We place a high priority on seeking their input, recognizing their successes and making sure they have the very best products, technology and business processes in place. These efforts were recognized recently when Erie was ranked highest among personal lines insurers in the J.D. Power 2022 U.S. Independent Agent Satisfaction Study released in October. This is the second year in a row the independent property casualty insurance agents have rated Erie highest in satisfaction. Our independent agent distribution model has been a key driver of our success for nearly 100 years, and we will continue to build on that creation of trust and collaboration as we move into our second century. Before we close, I do want to acknowledge some changes to our executive team that have been announced since our last call. As we shared publicly in November, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Gutting, will be retiring at the end of April. Greg is a familiar voice on this call, and he's been an extremely valuable member of our executive team, both for the wise financial perspective and expertise he offers and the institutional gained in his nearly 40-year career in Erie. His partnership will be truly missed. Julie Pelkowski will succeed Greg to become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on May 1. Julie currently serves as Senior Vice President of our Enterprise Office. Prior to taking on that leadership role last year, Julie served as Senior Vice President and Controller. She began her career in 1991 with Deloitte & Touche and joined Erie in 1998 as an internal auditor before moving into various leadership roles within our finance division. Julie's years of exceptional leadership have positioned us strongly for the future. Finally, we welcome to our executive team, Sean Dugan. Sean was promoted to Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Corporate Services on January 1. Since 2020, Sean has led our Human Resources as Senior Vice President. And prior to that, he held the position of Corporate Human Resources Officer. His 30-year Erie career includes leadership roles, corporate training and development, talent acquisition and community outreach. Sean's expertise in both business and support functions and his deep knowledge of the organization is a tremendous asset to our executive team. As always, I'd like to thank our employees and agents for their dedication to our above all and service commitment, our shareholders for their continued support and trust and all of you, for your continued interest in Erie. Thank you all for listening in today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call was pre-recorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I'd like to introduce your host of the call today, Vice President, Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Your line is open. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our first quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.

This prerecorded call is property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior risk consent of Erie Indemnity company. With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie's performance for the first quarter of 2023. Last week on April 20, we marked the 98th anniversary of our company's founding. And a few days later, held our annual meeting with shareholders. For the first time in 3 years, we were able to hold this meeting in person, and we did so just a block from our home office, at the historic Warner Theater in Downtown Erie, Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, we also welcomed the final groups of employees returning to on-site work. This move marked the end of our pandemic-driven working arrangements, with the COVID-19 public health emergency set to expire in just a few weeks. We look forward to moving fully into a new mode of interaction and engagement as we embrace hybrid work as a model for the majority of our workforce. Pandemic pushed the breaks on many aspects of how we live and work, while at the same time, accelerating the pace of technology and change. Additional challenges like inflation, supply chain issues, and labor shortages emerge from the pandemic and have persisted even as COVID has slowed. Many of these challenges have had a direct impact on the unusually high combined ratio for Erie Insurance Exchange. We're continuing with a slate of intentional steps to reduce our combined ratio through a measured approach to rate increases, adherence to expense management and strict underwriting guidelines and agency profitability reviews. We're also placing a high priority on modernizing our legacy technology platforms and investing in digital capabilities that meet customer needs and expectations. I'll share more about that notable progress that's been made so far this year. But first, let's turn to our first quarter financials. Like the rest of the industry, our combined ratio continues to be impacted negatively by the inflationary environment. That was compounded in the first quarter by an increase in the severity of weather events. Cat losses from the poor weather events experienced in the first quarter added [indiscernible] points to the combined ratio and adverse development from [indiscernible], which relate in 2022 added another 4 points to the first quarter combined ratio [indiscernible] 122.7% compared to 104.6% for the first quarter of 2022. Tomatoes severe wins and flooding have battered Kentucky and Ohio, in particular, during the first few months of 2023. I'd like to extend my gratitude to our catastrophe claims and personal loss of loss teams as well as agents and staff working tirelessly to serve our policyholders affected by these unrelenting storms. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg to expand on our first quarter results. Greg? Gregory Gutting : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Earlier, Tim mentioned that we held our 98th Annual Shareholder Meeting earlier this week. As you know, that meeting was my last serving as Chief Financial Officer, given my retirement effective April 30. Over my 37-year career, I have been afforded many wonderful opportunities and I am thankful for all the relationships I have cultivated during my tenure. With our prior 3 shareholder meetings being held virtually, it was wonderful to have everyone attend the live event in person and get a chance to spend time with our long-term shareholders. As I begin the next chapter in my life, Julie Pelkowski will be taking over as your company's newest CFO. Julie has had a distinguished career at Erie, first joining our internal audit department in 1998. In 2016, Julie was named Senior Vice President and Controller, and I look forward to seeing all the great success Erie will have under her leadership. Now I'd like to share with you the first quarter results for 2023. Beginning with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct written premium growth for the first quarter was 14.6%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which increased 36% over the prior year. With the combined ratio for the quarter of 122.7%, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $9.9 billion, down $200 million from December 31. Now shifting to Indemnity. In the first quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $86.2 million or $1.65 per diluted share compared to $68.6 million or $1.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2022. Operating income increased 31.1% or $26.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $70.1 million or 14.4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $900,000 in the first quarter. Turning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $27.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increases in agent compensation were driven by increases in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, slightly offset by decreased agent compensation awards. Noncommission expense increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Underwriting and policy processing expenses increased $2.7 million primarily due to increased personnel and underwriting report costs. Information technology costs increased by $11.5 million, driven by increased professional fees, hardware and software costs and personnel costs. Also, administrative and other expenses increased $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by the increased personnel costs related to compensation and building occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. Investment losses before taxes totaled $5 million in the first quarter. The results were primarily driven by equity and losses of limited partnerships of $10.8 million in the first quarter. I will remind you that the limited partnership asset classes and runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 3 months of 2023, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $55 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today. And now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thank you, Greg. As I mentioned earlier, modernizing our legacy platforms and investing in greater digital capabilities are among our highest priorities in 2023. We're making significant progress in several areas, but perhaps the most visible our recent updates to our claim status platform. A series of Erie redesigns were introduced last year, all influenced by agent feedback, and pros portfolio teams have been working to develop additional updates launched and merged that provide more robust claims information to agents and customers on a more intuitive platform. As 1 of our agents recently said, the updates to claim status are moving the needle towards becoming a true concierge service for customers. These recent enhancements are just the beginning and 1 example of the investments we're making to further improve the experience of customers and agents. In our last call, I mentioned that our online account platform, which acts as a digital self-service tool for customers is now being used by more than 1 million households. This is an important milestone because the value of this 1 tool delivers. Online account gives customers the self-service features they want and expect and that allows our customer service team and agents to spend less time filling questions about topics like billing and more time on meaningful and valuable interactions with customers. The growth of online account also creates opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce waste and expenses. Earlier this month, a paperless option for policy documents was introduced. Now in addition to paperless billing, customers can choose to access policies on demand through the platform. With an average policy document of 15 pages and up to 97% of personal line policies being eligible for paperless, it's easy to see the potential these capabilities have to reduce our expenses and environmental impact. Also at the heart of these enhancements is our commitment to providing the best possible service to our customers. Our goal is to ensure everyone we serve has a positive experience no matter who they are or how they're engaging with us. These efforts continue to be affirmed through industry accolades on the heels of the first place ranking last fall by J.D. Power for Independent Agent Satisfaction among personal lines carriers. We were proud to be ranked highest in another important J.D. Power study for customer satisfaction in the 2023 U.S. property claims assessment released in February. Erie scored 38 points higher than the industry average and jumped 30 points over 2022. These accolades are not our only gauge of our success, but they do affirm that we're doing the right thing by our customers and agents. What's also notable about this particular recognition is that it comes at a time when our frontline teams are facing significant talent shortages. I'd like to commend our teams in claims, customer care operations and first ones of loss for their continued commitment to being above all in service. We were also proud to recently be named to the 2023 Best of the Best lists of insurance industry for the Black EOE Journal in Hispanic Network Magazine. And for more than 10 years in a row, Erie was recognized by the American Heart Association with a National Platinum level workforce well-being award for our commitment to employee health and wellness. These 3 recognitions are an affirmation of our continued efforts to be a great place to work for all. Before we close, I would like to wish the CFO, Greg Gutting, all the best in his upcoming retirement after an impressive 37-year career at Erie. He will certainly be missed by the company as Chief Financial Officer, and will personally be missed by many, including myself, as a valued colleague and friend. Greg is leaving us, however, in very capable hands. Julie Pelkowski will assume the CFO role on May 1, and will join me to share Erie's financial results on our second quarter call. Until then, thank you all again for your interest in Erie. End of Q&A:",

This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording.

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie's performance for the second quarter of 2023. The executive team and I have spent a lot of time over the past few months connecting with our various stakeholders, with agents at our annual branch meetings across our footprint and at our combined agency taskforce meeting here in Erie, with employees at our open door, leader forum and claims recognition meetings and with investors at our annual meeting with shareholders held in April. A frequent topic of discussion at these recent gatherings has been the challenges the industry continues to face. Inflation, supply chain issues and an increase in severe weather are among the most pressing, and we're certainly feeling the effects of them so far in 2023. That's reflected in our combined ratio, which now stands at 120.8% compared to 113.7% for the first half of 2022. Both personal and commercial lines continue to experience an increase in severity for property, auto and uninsured and underinsured motorist claims, although costs are growing at a more moderate pace than in the prior year. Year-to-date, personal auto claims severity is up 6% compared to last year and 21% since 2021. Weather and catastrophe losses are also on the rise. Hail, wind and tornadoes have been battering areas across our footprint in the first half of the year. Through June of 2023, catastrophe event claim counts were up nearly 70% compared to 2022, and catastrophe claims contributed 16% of the combined ratio at the end of the second quarter compared to 10% in 2022. While many of the external factors impacting the combined ratio are out of our control, we're taking actions within our control to bring it down to more favorable levels. Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, will be talking more about some of those strategies in just a few minutes. And despite the factors impacting our combined ratio, our overall performance picture is strong, especially in our growth and retention numbers. Overall, policies in force are up 5.2% with personal lines reaching its highest growth in 20 years at 5.5%. Retention is also strong at 90.8% for personal and commercial lines combined, with retention for personal auto, which stands at 92.3%, approaching an all-time high. This impressive growth and the loyalty demonstrated by our policyholders is a testament to the strong value proposition we offer. Our recent ranking on the Fortune 500 list for the 20th consecutive year, this year at number 414 is yet another. All said, we are confident in our overall financial stability as we continue to navigate the challenges of today's world. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Julie Pelkowski to offer a closer look at our financials. This is Julie's first earnings call since taking the reins as Erie's Chief Financial Officer in May. Welcome, Julie. Julie Pelkowski : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Over the course of my 25-year career with Erie, I have had the pleasure of working across several different disciplines that have prepared me for the role of CFO, and I'm delighted to be with you this morning to share our second quarter results. As Tim mentioned, our business experienced an unusually early and severe start to the storm season, and we continue to feel the pressure of the inflationary conditions that are contributing to higher loss severities. These two factors are the primary drivers of the increase in our combined ratio in the Exchange. While we are prioritizing efforts to improve the Exchange's profitability, the Exchange generated substantial growth in the second quarter of 2023. This quarter marks the first time in our history that we've written over $1 billion of direct written premium in a single quarter. This strong production growth drove the increase in the amount of management fee revenue for the Indemnity Company, which you'll see as we review our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the second quarter was 16.3%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which climbed almost 32.6% over the prior year. With a combined ratio for the quarter of 118.9%, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $9.7 billion, down $400 million from December 31st. The primary focus of our strategy to address the elevated combined ratio is taking rate increases to more appropriately match the level of losses we're experiencing in the current environment. This has resulted in us taking double-digit rate increases and also evaluating our rating needs more frequently. Of course, we monitor our competitive position and the rate increases we are taking are in line with the industry. We also stay focused on our underwriting and agency management discipline and have identified certain initiatives targeted towards improving profitability. These strategies, along with several others, will allow us to continue driving down our overall combined ratio. Now shifting to Indemnity. In the second quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $118 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, compared to $80 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of 2023, net income was $204 million, or $3.90 per diluted share, an increase compared to the first half of 2022 net income of $149 million, or $2.84 per diluted share. Operating income increased 29%, or $30 million, in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. Indemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 29.9% or $56 million for the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $89 million or 16.3% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. For the first six months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase of $159 million, or 15.4%, compared to the first half of 2022. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased just over $1 million in the second quarter and $2 million in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Turning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services, commissions increased $44 million in the second quarter and $71 million in the first half of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. Non-commission expenses increased $16.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $3.7 million, primarily related to the increased production growth. Information technology costs increased by $3.3 million, driven by increased personnel costs and professional fees. Also, administrative and other expenses increased $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by increases in personnel costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. For the first six months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expenses of $33 million, primarily driven by increases in technology costs of $14.8 million and administrative and other costs of $10.6 million. The increased technology costs were driven by higher professional fees, personnel costs and hardware and software costs. Administrative and other costs increased $10.6 million, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. Overall, personnel costs were impacted by increased compensation, including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards, partially offset by lower pension costs compared to 2022. Investment income before taxes totaled $12 million in the second quarter compared to a loss from investments before taxes of $2 million in the same period of 2022. For the first six months of 2023, we recorded investment income before taxes of $7 million compared to $1 million in the first six months of 2022. While we recognized limited partnership losses in the first six months of 2023, these losses were offset by both higher bond net investment income and lower realized and unrealized losses on equity securities, which drove the improvement over the same period of 2022. I will remind you that the limited partnership asset class is in runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management and we maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first six months of 2023, our financial performance enabled us to pay our shareholders over $110.8 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Julie. Another major topic of discussion recently has been our focus on modernization. As I've mentioned in previous calls, transitioning out of legacy platforms and investing in greater digital capabilities are among our highest priorities in 2023. Recent updates to our claim status platform provide more robust claims information to agents, employees and customers on a more intuitive platform. And another claims platform, Erie Claim Center was recently migrated to the cloud. This was our largest migration to date with several more planned as part of Erie's overall cloud transformation initiative. We expect these innovative efforts to increase speed and productivity across the enterprise. Another key modernization effort is tied to our upcoming refresh of workers' compensation, which will introduce full policy servicing capabilities on our quote application and service platform, a new billing platform that allows for enhanced pay as you go functionality, and the introduction of online accounts for our commercial customers. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app and online account platform. Most recently, we introduced self-service functionality for roadside assistance with a mobile app through Agero. Several other modernization efforts are also underway. All aimed at helping us to increase efficiency, reduce expenses and to better serve our customers and agents. You can expect to hear more updates on this work in future earnings calls. Yet another challenge almost all industries have been facing recently has been the tight labor market and the war for talent. We're pleased to share that the challenges in attracting and retaining talent we experienced in 2021 and 2022 have leveled out. In our claims division where we experienced some of the biggest talent challenges, all open positions have been filled, and we've developed an advanced staffing capacity tool that enables us to identify and respond to staffing needs in real time. In this tough labor market, workplace accolades are particularly important, so we're excited to have recently earned a Great Place to Work certification from the Great Place to Work Institute. This recognition is based on the results of an engagement survey sent to all Erie employees in June. Four out of five Erie employees completed the survey and 86% of those employees said Erie is a great place to work. This compares to just over half or 57% of employees at typical U.S. based companies and 91% for the benchmark set by Fortune 100's Best Places to Work. We're proud of our long-standing reputation as an employer who places a great deal of importance on our workforce, culture and treats employees like family. This recognition as a certified Great Place to Work affirms that commitment. We're also proud to have recently earned a global distinction as one of only four U.S. based insurers named to all three of Forbes World's Best Insurance Companies list for 2023. Forbes ranked the best insurance companies in three areas : homeowners, auto and life insurance. Erie Insurance ranked number five in the U.S. for auto, number seven in the U.S. for homeowners and number 11 in the U.S. for life. With that, I'd like to thank you all again for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Q - :",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session row I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Pelkowski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market close and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website erieinsurance.com.  Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks. For information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC dated October 26, 2023 and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company.  With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into our financial results for the third quarter, I'd like to share some details around the recent announcement we made related to our approach to hybrid work. We began to return to on-site work last year, we acknowledge we would need to learn and adapt. We knew we'd likely evolve as we experiment with new ways of working following the pandemic. Now, after more than a year of working on a variety of hybrid arrangements, we've learned we need a more consistent approach to how and where we work. We believe it's important to increase the opportunities for employees to work together in person to collaborate and learn from one another. This helps us build stronger bonds with our colleagues and ultimately, stronger teams. We also know that in-person interaction is important to our business. For building the relationships vital to our business model and for upholding our service promise to customers and agents. At the same time, we recognize employees have come to value the flexibility hybrid arrangements offer. With all that considered, we landed on a balanced and innovative approach. It increases opportunities for in-person interactions while giving employees more choice over when they work remotely. Starting in January, employees and hybrid roles will be given in a lot in the 52 days to work remotely each year. Employees will work on site in our offices on days that they are not using in a lot of remote day. This revised approach will help preserve distinct relationship aspects of our business and the vibrant Erie workplaces that support our collaboration, creativity and success.  And now let's turn to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2023. With respect to the Erie Insurance Exchange, inflation and weather-related events continue to adversely impact our combined ratio. Our year-to-date net combined ratio climbed from 120.8% through the first 2 quarters to 121.9% by the end of September. Positive investment income was not enough to offset underwriting losses resulting in a surplus decline of 6% since the second quarter.  However, we remain very strong financially with an overall surplus position of $9.1 billion. Like many other carriers, we've been taking rate increases to improve our profitability. These increases, along with an upsurge in customer shopping in response to rising industry rates have contributed to the 20-year high for growth in our direct written premium. That growth, which is over 16% year-to-date, is previously supported by strong retention of 91% for personal and commercial lines combined. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, for a more detailed review of our financials. Julie Pelkowski : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, the third quarter was similar to the first 2 quarters of this year. We are still being impacted by weather-related events across our footprint, and we continue to experience an elevated combined ratio due to inflationary pressures. That said, I am pleased to share that during the third quarter, the A.M. Best rating agency once again affirmed our A+ Superior rating for financial strength.  Now let me get into the details at hand for the quarter. As I noted, weather challenges continued in the third quarter, somewhat unexpectedly. Typically, storm activity diminishes in the second half of the year, but our footprint experienced two significant wind events in the early part of the third quarter. Catastrophe losses in the quarter also increased due to adverse loss development associated with prior storms occurring earlier this year. Non-catastrophe property claim severity continued to grow in both personal and commercial lines albeit at a more moderate rate than 2022.  Personal auto severity increases of 6% in 2023 are about half the level they were in 2022, while commercial auto and homeowner severity increase remain about 10%. To combat the increase in the combined ratio, we continue to take rate increases tightened underwriting guidelines and implement strategic agency management practices. Keep in mind that our policies span 12 months, and we will see a much more significant benefit next year from those increases as they are realized. Even with these rate increases, we are still maintaining high levels of retention, which is complementing our new business growth. For the year, we've increased new business premium more than 36% and total premium more than 16%.  With respect to the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the third quarter was 17.6%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which grew almost 40% over the prior year. With a net combined ratio for the quarter of 124%, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $9.1 billion, down nearly $1 billion from December 31.  Now shifting to Indemnity. In the third quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $131 million or $2.51 per diluted share compared to $84 million or $1.61 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2022. For the first 9 months of 2023, net income was $335 million or $6.41 per diluted share, compared to $233 million or $4.46 per diluted share for the same period in 2022. Operating income increased 39% or $42 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter of 2022. Indemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 33% or $98 million for the first 9 months of this year, compared to the first 9 months of 2022.  Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $97 million or 17.7% in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter of 2022. For the first 9 months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase of $256 million or 16.2% compared to the same period of 2022. The Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $1.5 million in the third quarter and $3.5 million in the first 9 months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.  Turning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services, commissions increased $45 million in the third quarter and $116 million in the first 9 months of 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. Non-commission expenses increased nearly $13 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to 2022 and underwriting and policy processing expenses increased almost $3 million, primarily related to increased underwriting report costs. Information technology costs increased by almost $1 million, driven by increased professional fees. Also, administrative and other expenses increased just under $10 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, driven by increases in personnel costs and professional fees.  For the first 9 months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expenses of nearly $48 million. Expenses were primarily driven by increases in technology investments of almost $16 million, including professional fees, hardware, software and personnel costs. Underwriting and policy processing expenses increased just over $9 million due to increased reporting, personnel and postage costs. Administrative and other costs increased over $20 million due to an increase in personnel costs.  Overall, personnel costs were impacted by increased compensation, including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards. This was partially offset by lower pension costs compared to 2022, due to an increase in the discount rate. The increases in incentive plan costs were driven by improved, direct written premiums and policies in force growth and a higher company stock price at September 30, 2023, compared to September 30, 2022. Investment income before taxes totaled just over $12 million in the third quarter compared to a loss from investments before taxes of nearly $1 million in the same period of 2022. For the first 9 months of 2023, we recorded investment income before taxes of $19.2 million compared to $300,000 in the first 9 months of 2022. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first 9 months of 2023, our financial performance enabled us to pay our shareholders over $166 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Julie. As we head into the last part of the year, we continue to make progress in our journey to modernize our legacy platforms and enhance our digital capabilities. In September, we launched a pilot for our refreshed workers' compensation platform. The refresh introduces full policy servicing capabilities on our float application and service platform, the introduction of online accounts for our commercial customers and a new billing platform that allows customers to manage their account. The enhanced platform is being piloted in Indiana, who plans to roll it out in additional states before the end of this year. We're also seeing positive impacts of some of the digital enhancements made earlier in the year. Our agents ask for more capabilities to connect with customers through our online account platform. Now, thanks to updates made to our claims staff as a portal earlier in the year, customers and agents have important claim status information at their fingertips along with many other options, including online auto ID cards and paperless invoicing. In our third quarter, we've seen customer engagement and claim status grew by 8% compared to last year at this time. We believe this consistent growth will continue into 2024. Before we close, I'd like to make note of several recent accolades for our business and our workplace. Forbes has recognized Erie, on its 2024 list of America's best insurance companies. Of the 84 companies on the list, Erie was 1 of only 5 to make a rankings in all 5 categories. Erie was ranked first in Permanent Life, 5th in Term Life, 6th in Auto, 7th in Renters and 8th in Homeowners. Erie was also recently named to Newsweek's list of America's Best Customer Service 2024, in the categories of homeowners and life insurance. These rankings were based on customers' likelihood to recommend, as well as criteria like customer focus, quality of communication, professional competence, range of services and accessibility.  Investor's Business Daily has listed in Erie on its 2023 most trusted financial companies list. The list is based on a survey that asks consumers to rate their financial service providers on attributes they said are most important to them. Erie ranked #2 in both auto and home insurance and 13th overall. On the workplace side, 3 of our employee Affinity Networks earned 2023 Diversity impact awards from the Global Employee Resource Group network. This is the world's largest network of employee resource groups, business resource groups and diversity councils dedicated to making measurable progress on diversity, equity and inclusion. Fred Johnson, Vice President of the Wisconsin branch and executive sponsor of Erie's African-American affinity network was also one of six recipients of the network's Diversity impact Executive Sponsor of the award for a third straight year.  Finally, our future focus internship program has been named to the rising insurance Star executive list of the industry's 50 best internship programs for the third consecutive year. The future focus program has helped launch the careers with hundreds of current Erie employees who started these interns and it continues to serve as an important talent pipeline. This past summer, more than 100 interns from 50 different colleges and universities worked in departments across the company. As always, thank you again for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our fourth quarter and year-end results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Pelkowski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market close and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website erieinsurance.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company\u2019s current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we\u2019ll move on to Tim\u2019s remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie\u2019s fourth quarter and year-end results for 2023. We\u2019re probably moving closer to celebrating a century of service, and we\u2019re doing so as a company with $10 billion in a premium, a milestone reached in the fourth quarter of 2023. This came in a year of both record-setting growth and significant challenges. We saw net income for Erie Indemnity Company reached an all-time high of more than $446 million, and growth for Erie Insurance Exchange hit a 20-year high of 17%, helping us hit that $10 billion mark and moving us towards 7 million policies in force. With all that said, we\u2019ve certainly been feeling the negative effects of the economic and environmental pressures that continue to impact our industry. Weather-related claims rose to nearly 70,000 in 2023, compared to roughly 50,000 in 2022. Even with the typical decline in weather-related claims in the second half of the year and overall claim severity leveling out, we ended the year with a combined ratio of 119.1%, 3 points higher than year-end 2022. We\u2019ve responded to the tough market conditions through rate increases, and we\u2019re also reinforcing our focus on underwriting standards and partnering with our independent agents on individualized profitability action plans where appropriate. This multi-pronged approach is aimed at improving the combined ratio over time. In addition, we\u2019ve placed greater emphasis on managing expenses across the enterprise and expect to see long-term savings through our work to modernize legacy technology platforms and to introduce new digital capabilities. I\u2019ll share an update on recent progress with those modernization efforts in a few minutes, but first, I\u2019d like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, who will provide a deeper review of our financials. Julie? Julie Pelkowski : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2023, we\u2019ve discussed how weather events and severity were the primary drivers of the profitability challenge for the Exchange. As Tim mentioned, we\u2019ve taken action on several fronts aimed at improving profitability. We are starting to see the benefits of the more significant rate increases taken recently with more to come. As a reminder, our policies span 12 months, unlike most of our competitors, so it takes longer to realize the benefits. We haven\u2019t yet seen a slowdown in new business growth, and our retention levels remain strong at 91.2%, despite these rate increases. Policyholder surplus ended at $9.3 billion at December 2023. While this was lower than where we started the year, we did see a positive turn in the fourth quarter with surplus increasing $203 million. Again, the combined ratio for the year ended at 119.1%, which was an improvement from September year-to-date, given the fourth quarter experienced a lower level of weather events and more moderate severity growth. Turning to the results for Indemnity, net income was almost $111 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $65.5 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. 2023 total year net income was just over $446 million, or $8.53 per diluted share, compared to $299 million, or $5.71 per diluted share in 2022. Operating income in the fourth quarter increased nearly $46 million, or 56.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the total year, Indemnity experienced an increase in operating income of $144 million, or 38.3%, compared to 2022. Both periods saw revenue growth outpaced expense growth. From a revenue perspective, management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased over $98 million, or 19.5%, in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, and over $354 million, or 17%, for the total year compared to 2022. These increases in both the fourth quarter and total year were in line with the respective increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the exchange. The main driver of the premium increase was that the exchange was continuing to experience substantial growth in new business premium, which grew over 43% in the fourth quarter, and almost 38% for the year, compared to the same respective prior year period. From an expense perspective, the total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased just over $54 million, or 12.2%, for the fourth quarter, and almost $216 million, or 12%, for the total year 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Our most significant cost of operations, our commission expenses, grew $53 million for the fourth quarter, while the total year commission expenses increased $169 million. The higher commissions in both periods were driven by the increase in direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange. Non-commission expenses for the fourth quarter grew $1 million, while the total year non-commission expenses grew $47 million. The fourth quarter increase was driven by additional investments in both technology of $3 million and customer service of nearly $1 million, offset by lower sales and advertising costs of over $2 million. Tim will provide greater detail on our technology and customer service deliveries in a couple of minutes. The increase in total year non-commission expenses was due to additional investments in technology of almost $19 million, and higher administrative and other expenses of $20 million, driven by higher personnel costs. Also the growth in number of policies led to an increase in underwriting and policy processing costs of $9.4 million. Our investments generated almost $10 million in pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the total year 2023, pre-tax income from investments was $29 million compared to $600,000 for 2022. Finally, in 2023, we paid our shareholders $222 million in dividends. Also, in December of last year, our Board approved a 7.1% increase in the 2024 regular quarterly cash dividend for both our Class A and Class B shares. Now I will turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Julie. The rapid pace of technology and changing consumer behaviors have heightened the sense of urgency to modernize our platforms and introduce new digital capabilities. As I mentioned earlier, we know it\u2019s important to long-term expense savings, and it\u2019s critical to our ability to offer innovative and customer-centric products and services. That\u2019s why we made modernization one of our top priorities in 2023. A notable example of progress is the migration of several legacy platforms to the cloud, a technology infrastructure that is more stable, secure, and efficient. The largest cloud conversion to date was our Erie Claim Center platform, which is now seeing a 75% reduction in system outage time and significantly reduced costs. In our third quarter call, I shared that we launched a pilot for a refreshed workers\u2019 compensation platform, starting in Indiana. Since that time, our team has successfully rolled out the platform in every state in our footprint. The refresh introduces full policy servicing capabilities, online account for commercial customers, and a new billing platform that allows customers the ability to manage their automatic payments. Other significant progress was made in the enhancement to our Claims Status Portal, a valuable tool that puts important claims information at the fingertips of agents and customers. In 2023, more than 75 different enhancements were made to the platform to improve the user interface and to make the information provided by the tool more robust. Nearly 100% of auto claims handlers and more than 70% of property claims handlers are using the tool to share important updates with agents and customers, helping claims get handled faster and more efficiently. These modernization efforts are continuing in 2024 and beyond, and we\u2019re embracing agile ways of working to help us work faster, improve our speed to market, and deliver the capabilities demanded by today\u2019s marketplace. That spirit of innovation is also behind the investments we\u2019re making through Erie Strategic Ventures. This venture capital arm of Erie Indemnity Company, formed in 2022, focuses on investing in the personal and commercial insurance value chain. And recently, we announced three initial startup investments, Wagmo, which offers tech-enabled pet wellness and insurance; Roots Automation, which leverages artificial intelligence to automate manual and time-consuming insurance processes; and Trust & Will, an online estate planning platform. These initial investments are adjacencies that have the potential to deliver value to Erie, our agents, and policyholders. In addition to capital, the startup companies also benefit from Erie\u2019s industry expertise. We look forward to continuing to build our portfolio to support more visionary entrepreneurs and help bring innovative products and services to the market. As I mentioned earlier in the call, weather claims have been up and significantly over the prior year, which makes accolades like those we recently received from J.D. Power even more meaningful. In December, J.D. Power ranked Erie the best in home insurance customer satisfaction, coming in at number one for both homeowners and renters insurance. Erie\u2019s score of 856 on J.D. Power\u2019s 1,000-point scale was 37 points higher than the homeowners insurance segment average for 2023. And both our ranking and score improved during a year when the study cited overall homeowner satisfaction is flat compared to the previous year. This recognition comes on the heels of two other first-place rankings from J.D. Power in 2023, one for property claims experience and another for independent agent satisfaction and personal lines. I would like to express my gratitude to our agents and frontline employees from claims, first notice of loss, and customer care operations for continuing to be above all in service, even in and especially in these demanding times. Thank you all for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie. Q - :",

With that, we'll move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie's performance for the first quarter of 2024. Last week, on April 20, we marked the 99th anniversary of our company's founding. Now on April 23, and we held our annual medium shareholders in person in the Thomas B. Hagen Building. At that meeting, I reflected on a remarkable journey Erie Insurance has been on for nearly a century. Two young men, H.O. Hirt and O.G. Crawford, opened the doors to the Erie Insurance in 1925 and brought in less than $30,000 in net premiums after the first year. Today, Erie's business has grown more than $10 billion in premium and almost 7 million policies in force, covering 12 states plus the District of Columbia with more than 6,500 employees and more than 14,000 independent agents. I'm humbled and proud to be leading the company, and I'm confident in our position in the industry and our financial stability as we enter our 100th year of business. I'll share some first quarter updates on our business and workplace in a few minutes. But first, let's look at our financials. In our last call, we reported that weather-related claims were up significantly in 2023, which had a negative impact on our combined ratio. So far this year, we're starting to see a turnaround and our ratio is headed in the right direction. I'll now turn it over to Julie to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Julie? Julie Pelkowski : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In 2023, we talked about our proactive approach to addressing the profitability challenge experienced by the Exchange, and that the most significant impact would come as a result of the higher rate increases that were taken. We anticipated a larger impact from these rate increases in 2024, given the fact that we have 12-month policies. Continued incremental improvement from rate increases, coupled with weather events that were lower in severity compared to the first quarter of last year, drove an improvement in profitability in the first quarter of 2024. Our combined ratio in the first quarter was 106% compared to 122.7% in the first quarter of 2023. Weather events contributed to 9 points to the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2024 versus 12.6 points in the same period last year. The rate increases continue to contribute to significant growth for the Exchange as well. During the first quarter, direct and assumed written premium of the Exchange increased 19%. Strong new growth continues with new business premium growing 32.4% compared to the same period last year. Total policies in force grew 7.1%. We also maintained a solid policy retention ratio of 91.2%. The continued strong premium growth along with high retention and a more favorable combined ratio resulted in the policyholder surplus of the Exchange growing $180 million in the quarter to $9.5 billion as of March 31, 2024. Shifting to the results for Indemnity. Net income was $125 million or $2.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2024 and compared to $86 million or $1.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Operating income in the first quarter increased over 25% to almost $139 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased 19.3% to just over $665 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, in line with the increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange. The total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $81 million or 17.3% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The most significant portion of our expenses are commissions, grew $67 million for the first quarter, driven by the increase in direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange. Non-commission expenses for the first quarter grew just over $14 million, driven primarily by increased personnel costs and agent-related costs. The significant growth in the Exchange's premium drove increases in our production support cost as well, such as underwriting and policy processing.  Technology investments continue, although overall technology costs were lower as more development costs were capitalized in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Income from investments totaled $15 million compared to a loss of nearly $5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Net investment income was nearly $16 million in the first quarter compared to just $2 million in the same period of last year due to increased limited partnership earnings and higher bond income. As always, we take a measured approach to capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 3 months of 2024, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $59 million in dividends. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Timothy NeCastro : Thanks, Julie. As I've mentioned in previous calls, migrating our legacy technology platforms has been a top priority for us,, and it continues to be in 2024. I'm pleased to share that we successfully modernized more than 1/3 of the legacy applications we've had in place, and we're also working to sunset those older systems as appropriate. This work is tied directly to another key priority, expense management. Upgrades and newer platforms can eliminate many of the inefficiencies and delays created by the older systems. One example of a process that's recently been tightened thanks to modernization is with the best review method of inspection for claims. Best review process often resulted in long cycle times for customers, agents and employees due to a lack of data integration, causing delays or pinning estimates. Now agents and customers can use the Photo Appraisal tool and list an established Direct Repair Program or DRP shops within their online account to determine the appropriate method of inspection during their auto claims. This results in faster claims times, often cutting days out of the process. The pace of change is a topic that both challenges and energizes us, whether we're talking about platforms, processes, products or on people. If you regularly tune into our earnings calls, you may recall that last year, we announced a new approach, we'd be taking to our hybrid workforce starting in 2024. Hybrid employees who make up roughly 60% of our workforce now have a bank of 52 remote workdays to use each year when they choose. Since beginning this new approach in January, we're pleased with how it's helping to create greater vibrancy in our offices and collaboration across teams. We continue to learn and make changes to further improve the in-office experience for employees, including new conference room technology and facility improvements and to support our sustainability efforts, we're installing energy costs across our home office campus to track and share the performance of each building, including electricity, natural gas and water consumption. Employees will be able to see how Erie compares to other commercial buildings with similar usage and size, helping us stay accountable for our energy use and keeping in top of mind for our workforce. Sustainability is one aspect of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen. We also continue to invest in the communities where we do business, helping us to build trust and relationships and reinforce our commitment to service. Recently, we announced 24 grants totaling close to $1 million for education-focused nonprofits as part of Pennsylvania's education improvement tax credit program. The ramp will help nonprofits offer and expand educational programs to prekindergarten to 12th-grade students, in particular, low income underserved and minority students in Northwest Pennsylvania. Erie has donated more than $11 million through the EITC program since it began in 2001. And in support of revitalization work underway in our hometown in Erie, Pennsylvania, Erie Insurance recently provided a $1 million loan with plans to provide an additional support in the future for a project that will transform from Erie's tallest building, the Renaissance Center at Penton State. Funds will help with plans to renovate this downtown landmark into an upscale hotel with space for restaurants, offices and public gatherings. This is an exciting project for Erie and complements the other work and investments underway downtown that we've also supported. It's all aimed at creating a vibrant community to work and live so we can continue to attract and retain diverse and high-quality talent that will position us for success in our next century. I feel a great sense of pride for where we are today. We're poised to move into our next century with a strong employee and agency force and impressive book of business and robust and contemporary technology platforms and prepared to weather continued challenges through thoughtful and proactive planning and we're devoted to keeping our long-standing principles live in ways that will continue to set us apart in the future. As always, I'd like to thank you for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie.",

With that, we will move on to Tim remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott. And thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the second quarter of 2024. As we reach the halfway point of our 99th year in business, I'm excited to share that we also reached a significant milestone for Erie insurance exchange, 7 million policies in force. Our last milestone was 6 million policies in force was reached in 2021, and adding 1 million policies to our book of business in just three years is no small feat. To give you a sense of scale, it took our company more than 60-years to reach our first million, and just 3, to get from 6 million to 7 million. So this recent milestone is no doubt a testament to our hardworking agency force and dedicated sales and underwriting teams. Our impressive growth and customer retention, which stands at just over 91% for personal and commercial lines combined, underscore the strong value proposition we offer. Putting service above all else is always our top priority and customers notice. That's why we hold true to the principles that have shaped our success for almost 100-years, while continuously adapting for what's ahead. I'm also pleased to share that Erie ranked number 376 on the 2024 Fortune 500 list of largest American Corporations. We moved up 38 spots from last year's ranking of 414. The 2024 list marks our 21st year in the Fortune 500, alongside some of the most well-known and successful companies in the country. Here to share some insights into our financial performance for the second quarter is Chief Financial Officer Julie Pelkowski. Julie? Julie Pelkowski : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operations we manage continue to experience strong growth in the second quarter of 2024, driven by steady new policy growth and solid retention, as Tim just mentioned. In addition, incremental improvements continue to be realized from our more significant rate increases. These increases have had the most impact when addressing our profitability challenge. With these efforts, the exchanges direct written premiums grew 20% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2023 with year-to-date growth through June 2024 at that similar 20% level. From a seasonality perspective, we generally see higher weather losses in the first-half of the year. We saw this trend hold true as the exchanges combined ratio was 115.9 in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 118.9 in the second quarter of 2023, with catastrophic weather events contributing 16.2 points and 16.9 points in those same respective periods. Worth noting is the more significant improvement in our year-to-date combined ratio of 111.1 in 2024, compared to 120.8 in the first six months of 2023. In these first six months, catastrophic weather events contributed 12.7 points versus 15.7 points in the same period of 2023. We did experience an improvement in our non-catastrophe loss ratio in the first six months of 2024, compared to 2023 of 72.2 points versus 73.8 points respectively. Additionally, in 2023, higher severity drove adverse development on prior accident years, increasing the combined ratio by 2.9 points. In 2024, moderating severity trends resulted in favorable development on prior accident years, improving the combined ratio by 2 points. In summary, our rate increases are having the desired impact, and with lower weather events and moderating severity in the first-half of 2024, we have seen a profitability improvement, compared to the same period in 2023. Our policyholder surplus dropped slightly from $9.5 billion in March 2024, although we maintained a strong surplus position consistent with our December 2023 level of $9.3 billion as of June 2024. Shifting to the results for indemnity, net income was $164 million or $3.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Year-to-date Indemnity net income was $289 million or $5.52 per diluted share, compared to $204 million or $3.90 per diluted share at this time last year. Operating income increased in the second quarter nearly 42% to over $190 million, compared to the second quarter of 2023, bringing our year-to-date 2024 operating income to $329 million, which was an increase of almost 35%, compared to the first-half of 2023. The main driver of these increases continues to be higher management fee revenue, resulting from the exchange's significant direct written premium growth. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased 20.1% to nearly $761 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2023, and nearly 20% to $1.4 billion in the first-half of the year, compared to this time last year. Total cost of operations from policy insurance and renewal services increased $73 million or 14% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The first-half of 2024 saw an increase of $154 million or 16%, when compared with the first-half of 2023. Commission expenses continue to be the largest driver, increasing almost $69 million or roughly 20%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 and nearly $136 million or almost 21% in the first-half of 2024, compared to the same respective period of 2023, again related to the substantial growth in the direct written premiums of the exchange. Non-commission expenses for the second quarter grew just over $4 million or 2.4%. This was driven mainly by production costs, such as underwriting reports and customer service costs, partially offset by lower information and technology spend, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Year-to-date 2024 non-commission expenses increased just over $18 million or almost 6%, compared to the first-half of 2023. This was driven by underwriting and policy processing expenses, as well as administrative and sales and advertising expenses. Technology spend was lower in the first-half of 2024, compared to 2023, partially offsetting these increases due to higher capitalized labor in 2024. Income from investments totaled almost $14 million, compared to earnings of nearly $12 million in the second quarter of 2023. Net investment income was just over $16 million in the second quarter, compared to almost $14 million in the same period last year. Total investment income in the first-half of 2024 was $29 million, compared to $7 million in the first-half of 2023. Net investment income for the first-half of 2024 drove most of this improvement, contributing $32 million, compared to $16 million last year, mainly due to a loss generated from limited partnerships in 2023 of almost $11 million. Additionally, we generated net realized gains in 2024, while in 2023 we experienced net realized losses. As always, we take a measured approach to capital management and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first six months of 2024, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $118 million in dividends. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Julie. Earlier in the call, I talked about our long-standing commitment to being above all the service. That means treating customers with care and compassion and handling their needs quickly and effectively. It also means giving them the ability to interact with us in the ways they prefer. To do that, we need to equip our agents with the tools, resources, and capabilities to ensure customers have a positive experience. Much of the work we've been doing over the first six months of 2024 has been focused on just that. We've made several enhancements for our customer and agent-facing platforms, and have made significant progress in our technology modernization journey. One example of an enhancement is the added ability for agents to set up car rentals for policyholders during the first notice of loss process. Now, customers don't need to make a separate call to secure a rental and streamline the process for our agents and first owners of loss teams. Since rolling out to all states in June, agents have set up nearly 2,000 rentals and they rated the ease of effort to do so at 9 out of 10. We also continue to modernize our legacy technology platforms, having successfully migrated four additional applications to the cloud in the first-half of the year. In addition, we recently decommissioned an outdated platform for data disaster recovery and moved to a new environment. This has resulted in notable improvements in replication and recovery times and reduced costs. Much more work is ongoing in our efforts to migrate to more modern platforms, reduce expenses and continuously improve the experience and satisfaction of our customers and agents. At the same time, we're looking at leveraging the emerging technologies and capabilities related to artificial intelligence. We've recently established an AI center of excellence dedicated to exploring potential AI use cases across the enterprise, targeting implementation where appropriate based on our business and operational strategies. More than 20 use cases are currently being explored, with many more in the queue. We know AI has a lot of potential benefits, particularly in improving efficiencies and reducing expenses. But we are taking a measured approach to ensure we're harnessing the power of AI responsibly and in the best interest of Erie and our stakeholders. And most importantly, to use it in a way that enhances our ability to provide a human touch rather than to replace it. Investing in technology is critical to our future. We also understand that investing in our communities is important. In April, Erie Insurance awarded 24 grants, totaling nearly $900,000 for non-profits to help provide and expand educational programs to school-age children as part of Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program. In June, we announced a $1 million gift to the United Way of Erie County to help launch the organization's community schools model at Erie High School. With this funding from Erie and other community partners, United Way will hire community school directors for Erie High School and provide inside the school support that includes health, mental health, vision, and dental care, clothing and personal hygiene items, and expanded learning and enrichment programs. I'm also pleased to share that through our charity challenge golf events in Erie and Allentown, Pennsylvania, We've now raised more than $2 million for non-profits in those communities since 2010. This year's tournaments alone raised nearly $200,000 for 40 charities in the Erie and Allentown areas. As I close out our call for the second quarter, I'd like to thank our employees and agents for their tireless dedication to Erie and our commitment to being above all in service. I'm confident in our strength and stability amid continued external pressures, and I'm proud of the massive amount of work that's underway to move us into the future. Thank you, as always, to our shareholders for your trust and support. And thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect. Operator :",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Erie Indemnity Company Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Scott Beilharz : Thank you and welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Pelkowski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for listening in to learn more about Erie's performance in the third quarter of 2024. The storms have been ravaging parts of our country and all those impacted by these disasters have certainly been on our minds in recent weeks. The aftermath of the Hurricane Helene, in particular has been devastating in areas of our footprint. Our claims teams and agents in the impacted areas and additional employees deployed to assist have been facing incredibly difficult circumstances. Many of them are experiencing losses themselves while providing much needed service to our policyholders. The lives lost, the homes and businesses destroyed and the devastation in those communities is hard to comprehend. Let us please keep them in our thoughts and prayers as they navigate this challenging and heartbreaking situation, and please support the relief efforts in any way you can. Our generous Erie employees have been donating to hurricane relief causes bolstered by Erie's matching gifts program. Typical 100% match on shareable giving was doubled for donations to the relief funds for the American Red Cross, World Kitchen and Team Rubicon. I'm pleased to share that so far, more than $60,000 has been donated by Erie employees and matched by Erie. Early in September, Erie made a $250,000 charitable contribution to the American Red Cross Disaster responder program, and we are working on additional donations to other local rescue causes in affected portions of our territory. We believe it is always important to do the right thing and give how you can, but especially when our people and our communities need it the most. Turning to our financials now. Helene and other weather related activity over the past quarter have had a negative impact on the combined ratio for Erie Insurance Exchange, but Erie Indemnity Company continues its strong performance thanks to continued growth in new business and solid retention. This growth was represented recently with Erie's addition to the S&P 500 Index for the first time in September. Here to provide some additional context around our third quarter results is Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, Julie? Julie Pelkowski : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, Erie Indemnity Company continues to experience strong operating performance which likely contributed to the addition of our company to the S&P 500 Index this quarter. As we've highlighted previously, the strong operating performance is driven by the recent significant increases in our primary source of revenue, our management fee revenue. As a reminder, we serve as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers or policyholders of the Erie Insurance Exchange, which includes providing policy issuance and renewal services, as well as administrative services. For the services provided, we retain a management fee calculated as a percentage, not to exceed 25% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. Thus, any changes to the Exchange's premiums will have a corresponding effect on the amount of the management fees we receive. The insurance industry has been experiencing increased loss cost pressures and weather-related activity that have resulted in significant increases to premium rates. The Exchange has not been immune to these pressures, and we've taken significant rate increases to combat the resulting profitability challenge. Because we write 12-month policies, there is a lag in timing to fully earn these rate increases intended to cover the increased loss costs. The realized premium from rate increases can take up to 24 months to impact the combined ratio, the Exchange's measure of profitability. Now as it relates to the third quarter, the Exchange's direct and affiliated assumed written premiums grew over 18% for the quarter and just over 19% year-to-date when compared with the prior period of 2023. The tremendous premium growth in both periods in 2024 can largely be attributed to the continued realization of rate increases, which are reflected in a significant increase in the year-over-year average written premium per policy of 12.8%. Year-over-year policies in force grew 6% despite the rate increases, and the Exchange maintained a strong policyholder retention at 90.8%. The Exchange's combined ratio was impacted by Hurricane Helene, as Tim referenced, and contributed 5.3 points to the third quarter 2024 combined ratio of 113.7 and 1.9 points to the Exchange's year-to-date combined ratio of 112. While 2024 continues to pose certain challenges, the rating and other actions we've taken, in addition to lower weather events overall this year, resulted in this current year-to-date combined ratio of 112, showing incremental improvement from the 2023 combined ratio at this time of 121.9. The Exchange's financial strength, as measured by policyholder surplus, has remained relatively stable at $9.2 billion at the end of September 2024 compared to $9.3 billion at the end of 2023. Turning to the indemnity. In the third quarter, the Indemnity generated net income of $160 million or $3.06 per diluted share compared to $131 million or $2.51 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, net income was $448 million or $8.57 per diluted share compared to $335 million or $6.41 per diluted share for the same period in 2023. Operating income increased 21% or $32 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, while year-to-date operating income increased 29.5% or $116 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. The main driver of these increases continues to be higher management fee revenue resulting from the Exchange's significant direct written premium growth. The Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $120 million or 18.5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, Indemnity saw an increase of $355 million or 19.3% compared to the same period of 2023, which is in-line with the direct written premium growth of the Exchange in the similar periods. Looking at the Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services, commissions, our largest expense, increased $66 million or 18.7% in the third quarter and $202 million or 19.9% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases in both periods were driven by and in-line with the growth in the Exchange's direct and affiliated assumed written premium. To a lesser extent, agent incentive compensation contributed to the increase driven by the profitability component of the incentive. Non-commission expenses increased $23 million or 13.8% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023. Primary drivers of the increase include higher personnel costs, higher costs tied to production, such as underwriting and policy processing expenses, and our additional investments in technology. We also continue to make community-related investments, as Tim highlighted earlier. For the first nine months of 2024, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expenses of nearly $42 million or 8.4%. Similar to the quarter, we saw higher personnel costs, higher costs tied to production, including underwriting and policy processing expenses and increased community-related investments. On a year-to-date basis, we also had higher agent related costs and credit card processing fees while we had lower information technology costs. The personnel cost increases in both the third quarter and year-to-date through September were impacted by increased compensation including higher estimated costs for our long-term incentive plan awards, which was primarily due to the substantial increase in the stock price throughout 2024. Turning to our investment operations. Indemnity maintains a conservative portfolio to support our objectives of steady and consistent growth in earnings per share, current and future dividend growth, protecting the company from downside risks in its operations, as well as reinvesting in the business if opportunities arise. In the third quarter of 2024, investment income before taxes totaled $19.5 million compared to just over $12 million in the third quarter of 2023. Over the first 9 months of 2024, investment income before taxes was $48.5 million compared to just over $19 million in the first nine months of 2023. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first nine months of 2024, our financial performance enabled us to pay our shareholders over $178 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim? Tim NeCastro : Thanks, Julie. As our customer base continues to grow, it's increasingly important to make sure our products and services meet their needs and that we equip agents with the tools to provide personalized and efficient service. One recent example is Business Auto 2.0, Erie's newly refreshed and enhanced Business Auto product currently being piloted in Indiana. It includes several new options and features, all conceived and developed based on agent feedback. It aims at helping agents meet the unique needs of their business customers, including enhanced quoting and processing experience and the ability to have vehicles for multiple states on one policy. A refreshed rating plan with new pricing factors also helps ensure competitive pricing for the most favorable risks and that all business is priced appropriately and sustainably. Agents piloting the new offering have been sharing valuable feedback, which has already led to several design enhancements. Continued interaction with our pilot agents through year-end will help us determine any additional adjustments needed before expanding the rollout into other states in early 2025. We also successfully launched a 10-state rollout of a new capability that can automatically enroll customers in our online account platform at the point of sale. Online account enhances customers' ability to access information, pay bills and track claims, increasing efficiencies and allowing our call center staff and agents to spend more time on more complex and meaningful interactions. This new capability is helping to increase adoption of this important tool and will also help us to better leverage customer data. Enhancements like these are part of a broader strategy to modernize our platforms, programs and data capabilities. Additional migrations of legacy platforms to the cloud and other digital capability improvements have been made over the past quarter and are ongoing. At Erie, we've always believed that our commitment to service extends not just to our customers, but also to the communities within our footprint. In August, Erie Insurance donated $450,000 in grants to nine non-profits through the company's Investing in Our Future educational brand initiative. The program is aimed at strengthening the connection between academic programming and out-of-school time activities with the goal of eliminating poverty through education. Since the grant program was launched in 2021, more than $1.7 million in grants have been awarded by Erie Insurance for education non-profits in and around our home city of Erie, Pennsylvania. This is in addition to more than $10 million donated to educational causes over the years to Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program. I'm also pleased to share two recent workplace accolades. First, Erie Insurance was named to the Forbes list of America's Best-in-State Employers for 2024 for the fifth straight year. Erie is ranked among the top 20 out of 100 employers in Pennsylvania that made the list. Erie Insurance was also awarded with four 2024 Diversity Impact Awards from the Global ERG, the world's largest network of employee resource groups, business resource groups and diversity councils. Our African American, Pride Alliance, Veterans and Women's Affinity Networks were recognized for being champions and diversity, equity and inclusion in our organization. As I close on our call for the third quarter, I'd like to share my appreciation for our employees and independent agents who uphold our Above all in Service promise every day and under any circumstance. Thank you also to our shareholders for your trust and support. Thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie.",
