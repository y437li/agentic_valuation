It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tina Romani, Head of Investor Relations for Kenvue. Thank you. Tina, you may begin. Tina Romani : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is our Chief Executive Officer, Thibaut Mongon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Ruh. Please note that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our operating and financial performance, market opportunities and our growth. These statements represent our current beliefs or expectations about future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially. For information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our earnings materials related to this call posted on our website and our filings with the SEC. During this call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial information. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these items to the nearest U.S. GAAP measure can be found in this morning\u2019s press release and our presentation available on our IR website. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Tina. Good morning and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call and our very first as a public company. Our recent IPO marked an important and exciting milestone in Kenvue\u2019s history. Over the last 135 years, we have established ourselves as the world\u2019s largest pure-play consumer health company. And now as a standalone company, we are looking forward to building on our strong heritage and continuing to deliver on our purpose to realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. Before we begin, as you may have seen this morning, Johnson & Johnson announced their intended next step in the separation of Kenvue. At this point, we are very limited on what information we can provide other than what has been made public, and as a result, we will not be able to discuss any further details at this time. What I can tell you is that we are ready to take on the next phase in our journey to becoming a fully independent company. For today\u2019s call, I will begin with an overview of our second quarter results, Paul will then take you through a more detailed view of our Q2 financials and 2023 outlook, and then Paul and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. But first, let me begin with our strong results this quarter. With over $4 billion in net sales, Q2 was one of the strongest quarters in our 135-year history and certainly is the strongest since the beginning of our business transformation in 2019. Organic sales grew 7.7%, bringing our first half organic growth to a very strong 9.4%. Similar to Q1, our growth was broad-based across all segments of our portfolio and across all geographic regions. So this quarter was yet another proof point showcasing the power of our portfolio. Our three segments did well. We saw double-digit growth in Self Care, continued recovery in Skin Health and Beauty and growth ahead of our long-term expectations in Essential Health. Further, we delivered balanced growth across all geographic regions, with North America contributing about half of the growth with all other regions representing the remainder. There were several portfolio highlights in the quarter, but let me focus your attention on a few standouts. In Pain and in Cough and Cold Care, we saw higher incidence rates drive continued demand for our leading brands such as Tylenol, Motrin and our other brands in these need states. Across our Self Care portfolio, we see innovation, premiumization and health care professional recommendations, all fueling market share growth for many of our brands. In Skin Health and Beauty, our performance in Sun Care showed the power of our brands as we see continued recovery after a period of disruption. Innovation, improved supply and strong commercial execution contributed to sustained market share growth for Neutrogena Sun this season. In Essential Health, our Listerine mouthwash superiority claim of dental floss is being deployed around the world, and our Listerine gum therapy product in the U.S. is ranked number one new code in the mouthwash category this quarter, and we continue to see the power of Band-Aid, where consumer-led innovation and strong customer partnerships delivered another strong quarter. Band-Aid was also recognized in the quarter as America\u2019s most trusted brands for 2023 by Morning Consult, and this is the second year in a row that Band-Aid has earned the top spot. With the macro environment continuing to be challenging, consumers are increasingly more choiceful with their purchase decisions. In the consumer health space, though, they turn to brands and products they know and trust and we have many of those brands in our portfolio. We see this playing out in the value-volume dynamics of Kenvue this quarter. While value represented 9.4 points of growth, volumes only declined 1.7 points and excluding the impact of our own intentional decisions like portfolio rationalization or suspension of our Personal Care business in Russia, volumes were about flat this quarter. Important to note that we delivered this exceptionally strong first half of the year, in part thanks to the investment we have made in our supply chain, building capacity and resiliency. While service levels will continue to be a focus area for us, we have made significant progress that have allowed us to capitalize on and deliver against the unique demands of the first half of the year. Regarding our margins, they continue to be healthy fundamentally when excluding non-operational impacts such as FX or standard company costs. Inflationary pressures, though moderating, continue to be meaningful. But this quarter, again, we use a combination of strategic value realization, both price and mix, and productivity initiatives in our operations to offset a significant portion of these costs, which Paul will get into in just a moment. So net, a strong quarter showing the power of our world-class portfolio of category-leading brands that includes many of the most recognizable household names across consumer health, which brings me to Kenvue\u2019s greatest source of competitive advantage. With a sole focus on consumer health, every day, our 22,000 Kenvue\u2019ers are committed to delivering science-based innovative solutions that increased relevancy with consumers and strengthen credibility with health care professionals. These relationships have been cultivated over decades through innovation supported by rigorous science based on our vast clinical research capabilities and meaningful cross-category consumer insights. As a result, brands across our portfolio have a long history of recommendations by health care professionals and are often the number one most recommended brand in their respective categories, which ultimately fosters lifelong loyalty to our brands, loyalty that is passed down from generation to generation. Our first half results exemplifies its loyalty and consumers\u2019 desire for our efficacious products. While consumers may be trading down in more discretionary and traditional staple categories, we have not seen this dynamic in our portfolio. Consistent with what we have seen historically during times of challenge and uncertainty, private label penetration for our categories remain stable on a global basis this quarter. Our first half results also reflect the unique opportunity we have to expand usage occasions across the spectrum of consumer health. There is no limit for consumers to take care of their own health. And for Kenvue, there is no limit to finding new ways to help consumers take care of their health. The categories in which we operate tend to be underdiagnosed, undertreated and underpenetrated. Using Sun Care, for example, since we are in the middle of the summer season, it\u2019s estimated that 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. Yet today, a majority of Americans do not use sunscreen on a regular basis. At Kenvue, we want to understand why that is? What are the barriers to adoption? That\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for us to leverage our extensive capabilities and consumer insights to develop innovative new products to better serve the needs of our consumers. So with this in mind, this year in the U.S., we launched Neutrogena PureScreen Plus Mineral UV in 4 sheds that blends mostly to complement skin tones. Our new products are up to 30% less whitening at the leading mineral sunscreen, which is one of the biggest frustrations consumers have. Innovations like these have fueled share gains through better customer retention, increased consumption and attraction of new consumers to the brand, all driving the strength we saw in the quarter for Neutrogena Sun Care. That\u2019s what makes this consumer health space very attractive the infinite ability to expand usage occasions and give consumers around the world new opportunities to take care of their health. Now let me take a moment to speak to the strength and agility of our operating model that supported our results. Since 2019, we have made tremendous strides in removing complexity, streamlining our organizational and operational footprint and simplifying our portfolio while investing in digital and omnichannel capabilities that position us well for the future. Today, we have a resilient portfolio with iconic brands well balanced across categories and geographic markets. Our model is designed to drive synergies across our portfolio from shared consumer insights, go-to-market strategies, operation, marketing, innovation and so on. While we set our strategy and allocate resources at the segment level, all 3 segments are focused on one single and cohesive end market, consumer health. Take products for children as an example. You will see products living in Self Care with children\u2019s Tylenol; in skin health with Neutrogena or Avino Sun for kids; or in Essential Health with Johnson\u2019s Baby or Band-Aid. But it\u2019s 1 consumer, 1 pediatrician, 1 understanding of the interaction between child and parents that allow us to present ourselves as a preferred partner for everything you need for children\u2019s health. And the same applies to the rest of the portfolio. This dynamic is a critical component in understanding the strength of Kenvue. In addition, being a pure-play consumer health business both drives efficiency across areas like R&D and advertising and also afford us agility and flexibility. We saw this agility in action this quarter with the Kenvue teams delivering strong performance on multiple fronts, including responding to unprecedented demand for Self Care brands. So as you can see, our second quarter results are emblematic of the power of our portfolio. In a dynamic macroeconomic environment, we delivered strong top line with operationally healthy margins and solid earnings per share, all of which supported the initiation of our first quarterly dividend as Kenvue of $0.20 per share. Now looking to the back half of 2023. This year has, for sure, been an incredible journey for Kenvue so far, but we have a lot to look forward to with the full year organic growth expected to be between 5.5% and 6.5%. Paul will take you through the assumptions embedded within our full year outlook, but I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the consumer landscape. It continues to be uncertain, and we anticipate market volatility will continue, including in the incidence level for the upcoming winter season. In this environment and building on the unique nature of the consumer health space, we, at Kenvue, will continue to stay focused on what we do best, delivering superior science-backed, efficacious health solutions to serve the needs of our 1.2 billion consumers around the world who know and trust our brands. In Self Care, we will deliver a consistent cadence of innovation and marketing programs to drive growth on our priority brands. You may have seen we just launched Tylenol Precise where we leverage in Self Care our extensive skin health expertise to develop a maximum strength topical pain treatment with rapid absorption in an esthetically pleasing next-level experience. For me, this is another great example of what we mean by the power of the portfolio with synergies across segments delivering innovative health solutions. Within Skin Health and Beauty, while we expect continued progress on distribution point recovery in the U.S. through the third quarter, we are planning to return to a normal cadence of innovation with a strengthened and more resilient supply chain and reactivation of marketing campaigns to continue to build momentum in our brands. And within Essential Health, we expect science-backed claims and innovation launches to drive category essentiality and relevance the effective execution while strengthening brand equity in priority markets. So as you can tell a lot to look forward to in the back half of the year. So in closing, as the largest pure-play consumer health company in the world and with unparalleled depth and breadth of our portfolio we offer a one-stop solution for retailers, positioning Kenvue as a preferred partner of choice for retailers who want to become the destination for everyday care. This quarter was another strong illustration of the resilience of our categories and the strength of the Kenvue operating model. None of this would be possible without the passion, commitment and owner\u2019s mindset demonstrated by our amazing team of 22,000 Kenvue\u2019ers who work every day to help consumers realize the extraordinary power of everyday care I want to acknowledge and recognize them here as we start our journey as a stand-alone company. To summarize, we feel confident about the future of this business with the strength of our brands, the power of our portfolio and our unique competitive advantages, which we believe will enable us to consistently deliver strong performance over time and drive long-term value for all our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be co-hosting our first earnings call to report on a strong quarter, our first after a successful IPO. I\u2019d like to echo Thibaut\u2019s acknowledgment of the passionate and talented team we have here at Kenvue. The team\u2019s execution on our proven strategies yielded strong broad-based sales growth with healthy underlying margins despite navigating continued significant inflationary pressure and a challenging macro backdrop. I can\u2019t be prouder of what this team has delivered in the first key steps of our journey as a public company. Now getting into the quarter. We had a strong and balanced quarter with every segment and geographic region contributing to our 5.4% reported growth and 7.7% organic growth. In terms of drivers, value realization, which is comprised of price and mix represented 9.4 points of growth. Approximately 60% of the value realization growth was driven by carryover of actions in the back half of last year, with the remainder driven by incremental actions in the first half of 2023. Notably, even with 9.4 points of value realization, volume remained strong with only a 1.7 point decline, which includes the impact of intentional strategic portfolio rationalization initiatives and the decision to suspend the sale of personal care products in Russia, which we are anniversarying this quarter. If not for these deliberate actions, volume would have been about flat, exemplifying the resilience of our brands. By segment, Self Care had another strong quarter with a segment gaining share globally, driven by increased consumption across all new states and priority brands, driving 14.2% organic growth. Value and volume were both strong at 10.6 and 3.6 points, respectively. In addition to broad-based strength across the cold, cough and flu categories globally, our new first-to-market vaping cessation indication in the U.K. is driving consumption in Nicorette and Digestive Health grew with strong Imodium consumption globally. On Allergy, we were very pleased with the performance of our largest brand, Cirtec, which continued to gain share in the U.S. this year, though we saw lower incidences this season. Moving to Skin Health and Beauty. Organic growth of 3.4% was comprised of 6.6 points of value realization with 3.2 points of volume decline. It\u2019s important to note that volume includes intentional strategic portfolio rationalization initiatives and the decision to suspend the sale of personal care products in Russia. Excluding this impact, volume was up low-single digits demonstrating the healthy underlying demand for our skin held brands. We are pleased with the recovery we are seeing in the business and expect gradual improvements to continue as we restore supply, regain points of distribution with retailer floor resets coming this fall and support our healthy brand equities through innovation and premiumization. This quarter\u2019s strength in Sun Care is a great example of our ability to grow and gain share when we have a full portfolio on shelf supported by innovation, premiumization and media support. Next, moving to Essential Health. Organic growth was 3.8%, comprised of 10.7 points of value realization and 6.9 points of volume decline primarily due to competitive micro dynamics, particularly in Asia. Similar to skin health, it\u2019s important to note that excluding intentional strategic portfolio rationalization initiatives and the decision to suspend the sale of personal care products in Russia, volume was only down mid single-digits. With a healthier core portfolio, the business is focused on strengthening brand relevance through innovation-driven brand differentiation and premiumization. Overall, our second quarter results are indicative of the leadership positions we hold across the growing consumer health categories in which we operate. The resiliency we\u2019ve seen this quarter and since our transformation efforts began in 2019 give us confidence that the investments we are making in our technology and digital capabilities to modernize our supply chain, product innovation pipeline, R&D and our strategic marketing are working and position Kenvue well to drive sustainable growth over the long-term. Now turning to gross margins. Excluding amortization, adjusted gross margin was 57.5%. We continue to face significant though moderating inflationary pressures during the quarter. Through value realization and supply chain productivity improvements, we were able to successfully offset the majority of these headwinds. In parallel, gross margin was negatively impacted by transactional foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 100 basis points and other non-operational costs related to building our stand-alone infrastructure. Our teams are focused on identifying and actioning productivity initiatives that will mitigate these headwinds. Moving to adjusted EBITDA margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.5% and reflects the impact of the ForEx headwinds I just mentioned and incremental cost of being a stand-alone public company. In Q2, our stand-alone public company costs were approximately $50 million to $60 million, which reflects a front-loading of these costs. Acknowledging the complexities of standing up a company of our size and scale and that there is more work ahead over the coming two quarters, we expect these costs to remain elevated as several investments are concentrated upfront in the process. However, we expect these costs to decrease and be offset by other productivity efforts over time, remaining in line with our initial expectations. Turning to taxes. As can be expected, there are several unique items impacting our second quarter effective tax rate with our IPO in May. On a reported basis, our tax rate is approximately 32.7%; and on an adjusted basis, our Q2 effective tax rate is 30%. The primary drivers for this higher tax rate versus last year are : first, higher GLT and subpart F taxes, net of foreign tax credits; and second, less favorable discrete benefits in 2023 as compared to 2022 related to share-based compensation, law changes and prior year items; and third, the recording of a valuation allowance on our ability to utilize foreign tax credit assets in Q2 of 2023. And finally, our adjusted net income was $581 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.32. All in, we are proud of what we delivered in our first quarter as a public company : strong and balanced top line with fundamentally healthy margins. As we look ahead, we remain committed to investing in our business for the long-term with an eye towards delivering attractive total shareholder returns in a balanced way, which brings me to our capital allocation philosophy. We have a proven track record of generating robust, durable cash flow north of $2 billion per year historically, which gives us the flexibility to pursue our balanced capital allocation strategy. This is comprised of four pillars : number one, responsibly invest resources in our iconic brands to drive profitable growth; two, return cash to shareholders through dividends; three, de-lever, our reliable cash flow gives us the flexibility to prudently de-lever and reduce interest rate expense at the appropriate time; and number four, assess potential inorganic tuck-in growth opportunities that strengthen our position as a leader in consumer health. And we\u2019ve already begun executing on this strategy with this morning\u2019s announcement that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.20 per share. The decision by our Board reflects the confidence we have in our ability to deliver profitable growth over the long-term while returning cash to shareholders and their commitment to our balanced capital allocation strategy. Now let\u2019s get into our 2023 outlook. Starting with top line. Reflecting our strong first half, we expect full year net sales growth to be between 4.5% and 5.5% and organic growth to be between 5.5% and 6.5%. At current spot rates, we expect an approximate 1-point negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations for the full year. A few other items to keep in mind as you model the remainder of the year. It\u2019s important to consider a strong performance in the back half of 2022, as we improve service level over that period. Further, our first half 2023 results benefited from a couple of one-time-in-nature dynamics that we would not expect to continue in the second half. First, our Q1 results were supported by higher-than-normal inventory replenishment, primarily in Self Care and Skin Health and Beauty. This was a result of our retail customers exiting Q4 with lower-than-average inventory levels, generating outsized orders during the quarter as they looked to restock. Second. Globally, there has been an exceptionally strong cold, cough and flu season throughout the first half of the year. While we will be operationally ready for any level of seasonal demand, our outlook contemplates more normal incident rate levels this coming winter. With regards to interest, we expect reported net interest expense to be approximately $270 million and approximately $300 million on an adjusted basis. Moving to taxes. With regards to the full year, we expect a reported effective tax rate of 34.5% to 35.5%. On an adjusted basis, we expect the range to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. The higher rate versus prior year is primarily driven by jurisdictional mix of earnings and less favorable discrete benefits in 2023 as compared to 2022. On the bottom line, we expect full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.26 to $1.31. This range assumes a full year 2023 weighted average share count of 1.855 billion shares. As we look to the back half, we continue to operate in a challenging environment with ongoing pressures from labor costs, raw materials, packaging and foreign exchange volatility. While our guidance reflects a variety of scenarios, we remain focused on the things that we can control and will utilize the levers within our operating model to mitigate these headwinds. As we have done over the past several years, I\u2019m confident in our proven ability to navigate on certain operating environments, leveraging the power of the portfolio and the expertise of our teams. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Thibaut for some closing remarks. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Paul. Again, we are pleased with the strength of our second quarter results and our first quarter as a publicly traded company. This quarter highlighted our unique model as the world\u2019s largest pure-play consumer health company, building on our clear sources of competitive advantage to deliver robust financial performance. And now let\u2019s open up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good morning. And thank you for the questions. You mentioned innovation several times on the call, and you previously shared that Kenvue has launched over a 100 new product innovations each year since 2020 and they have comprised about 10% of net sales each year. Are you on track for product innovations to contribute to a similar amount to net sales this year? And also, what gives you confidence in the coming quarters that consumers are still willing to spend on higher price innovation and consumer health when we have seen some greater trade down within some categories in HPC? Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Good morning, Anna. Thank you for your questions. Yes, as you rightly pointed out, innovation is a big part of our model at Kenvue. That\u2019s what we have been doing historically and that has been our history of 135 years with their many first-to-market innovation. And we definitely intend to continue on this trajectory. I talked in my prepared remarks about a number of examples of innovation we launched this quarter and they have been well received. And we are excited to \u2013 about what is in the pipeline and what we are about to launch in the market in the back half of this year across all three segments. I would remind you that for us, innovation means not only new products, but also it can be a new claim or a new clinical data that allows us to give consumers and healthcare professionals another reason to use our brands. So yes, we are pleased with the health of our innovation pipeline and the impact it has on our business. Regarding your second question regarding the consumer confidence, while you may have seen in, I would say, more traditional staple categories, some downgrading happening in some geographies. At Kenvue, we don\u2019t see this dynamic happening in our portfolio. You saw that excluding our own intentional discontinuations. Our volumes were flat in the second quarter despite strong value realization. You remember that we saw the same thing happening in the full year 2022. So what we see is that even in this more dynamic environment, consumers remain focused on their health and well-being. They want to take control of their own health and they are looking for trusted product, solutions and brands that have been in their household for years, for decades, sometimes for generations. And as you know, many of these brands are in the Kenvue portfolio. So that\u2019s what makes us confident in the fact that our brands will continue to be the go-to brand for consumers around the world. Anna Lizzul : Thank you. And just as a follow-up, in terms of distribution, are you happy right now with your distribution with various retailers like Walmart, Target and the drug channel? Do you see any areas where you might be under penetrated or any potential categories where you can expand distribution with certain retailers, either domestically or internationally? Thibaut Mongon : Yes. I would tell you that domestically and internationally, distribution is always an opportunity for our vast portfolio of brands. It\u2019s something that we continuously work on with our retail partners around the world across the portfolio. Following the period of disruption we had in the past that particularly hit of Skin Health and Beauty segment and some part of our Essential Health segment, we are focused on recovering distribution points. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we have made so far, but I would expect a continued recovery in distribution points in the back half of the year. But beyond this specific event, distribution is something that we always work on with our retail partners, yes. Anna Lizzul : Great, thank you. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on reporting the first quarter as a public company. I have two questions on top line. The first at the total company level, just how you\u2019re thinking about the evolution of price and volume in the second half of the year and whether you have additional pricing actions that you\u2019re contemplating? Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Good morning, Filippo, thank you for your question. So regarding the back half of the year, I would remind you a couple of things. First of all, we are going to comp a higher base than we had in the back half of \u201822 as we started recovering service levels. Second, we had, in the first half of 2023, two items that we would not expect to repeat in the back half of the year. The first one is the fact that in the first quarter, we saw retailers restocking our products significantly knowing that they had exited 2022 with extremely low inventory levels. The second thing is that we have seen a very strong incidence in the past winter season. For this coming winter season, we are planning with a more normal season. So that\u2019s what we expect in \u2013 for the back half of the year. The back half will continue to see a mix of value realization and volume. Distribution gains will play a role, we talked about it with, Anna a minute ago. Value realization, price and mix will continue to play a role as well with targeted price actions to cover continued elevated input costs, but also premium innovation, innovative solutions and favorable mix. So all of that will lead to our guidance of an organic growth comprised between 5.5% and 6.5% growth. Filippo Falorni : Got it, thank you. And then just a follow-up, a second question, particularly Self Care. As you mentioned, very strong cough and cold season, you\u2019re expecting a more normal one. Are you \u2013 do you think there was also a little bit of pull forward in demand in the first half of the year as you think about the segment half? Have you contemplated maybe like a bit more destocking at the retailer but also at the consumer level embedded in your guidance for the Self Care segment, particularly? Paul Ruh : Filippo, good morning. This is Paul. Thank you for the question. We did not see a pull-through. Our inventory \u2013 retail inventory or inventory are in balance. And in the case of Self Care, seasonalities are normalizing as that\u2019s what we have contemplated in our forecast. So we did not see a pull-forward in demand for the second year. Expect a normalized season in the balance of the year. Filippo Falorni : Great. Thank you, guys. I will pass\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. I just want to follow-up a bit on the commentary regarding the consumer environment and just see if you can speak to the consumer behavior towards the end of the quarter. If you\u2019re still seeing, in general, consumers being not on trading or how you\u2019re seeing price elasticity coming along? And then also, as you just mentioned, regarding the cold season, but any word on how we should be thinking of puts and takes of retail inventory, pantry inventory and consumer demand? Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Andrea, thank you for your question. So as I mentioned, we live in the consumer health space, which might behave in a different manner compared to other consumer staple categories. Our world is really about bringing efficacious solutions to cater for real needs of consumers around the world. So we are operating in less discretionary categories. And we have a very strong portfolio of brands that are very often synonymous with our categories. So when we \u2013 when you combine these two factors, you see that consumers continue to be focused on their health and wellness. They want to trusted solution, trusted products that they know, that they trust, that are recommended by the healthcare professionals that they have seen their household for a very long time. These are the brands we are talking about with Kenvue. I\u2019ll give you a couple of proof points. If you look at our key segments of Self Care and Skin Health and Beauty, again, excluding the intentional discontinuations we made ourselves, volumes are up in both segments. Another proof point is the fact that we don\u2019t see private label penetration \u2013 we see private label penetration stable this quarter, which is in line with the history of private label. We have seen that in the past, even when times are tough, private label penetration doesn\u2019t tend to fluctuate very much. And the last proof point I would give you is what we are seeing as we speak in the summer season in Sun Care, where Neutrogena range is doing extremely well. We are a market leader in the U.S. We have a premium positioning. We launched premium innovation. All of that is extremely well received by consumers, and we are gaining share in the U.S. with Neutrogena Sun. So we are aware of consumer dynamics. We make sure that our products are accessible at different price points to cater for different needs of different consumers. But we are also very confident in the robustness of our portfolio and our ability to serve consumers with the products and solutions they need. That\u2019s what we have been doing for 135 years and that\u2019s what we intend to continue to do. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Just a follow-up, if I may, in terms of like the other categories that are not so health-oriented, for example, Listerine and some of the other categories within Adhesives and Wound Care, is that applied to that as well? Thibaut Mongon : So we \u2013 in Essential Health, you \u2013 as Paul mentioned, the \u2013 we are pleased with the performance of the segment at 3.8%, 10.7% of value realization. When you exclude discontinuations, it\u2019s mid-single-digit volume decline. So I would say volume held up pretty well in this area. Wound Care had another good quarter with strong customer partnership, good innovation with Band-Aid. Listerine is \u2013 we are pleased with the performance of our gum therapy product, which \u2013 in the U.S., which is the number one new code in the U.S. this quarter. The Listerine gum therapy gives you 4x healthier gums in 3 weeks and consumers are responding very well to this offering. We saw soft softness in the category in Asia, but we continue to gain share there. So that\u2019s how I would summarize the performance of Essential Health. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you to both. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Grom : Thanks operator and good morning everyone. So, I was actually hoping to get some more color on the gross margin performance. So, I know you mentioned headwinds from FX, standup costs and inflation, but value realization was strong, and you also mentioned productivity as a tailwind. So, can you maybe just help us bridge the decline in the quarter, which I think was a bit weaker than we were expecting? And then second part to this question, as we look through the balance of the year, is there any color you could share on these moving pieces? And how maybe specifically we should be thinking about gross margin progression? Thanks. Paul Ruh : Yes. Good morning peter and thank you for the question. We are in fact navigating a volatile environment for a couple of years now, but I am actually very proud of the way we have been doing it consistently with our experience. In the case of the quarter, we still see some elevated inflation and ForEx, transactional ForEx was also a headwind However, we have an arsenal of tools to be able to offset partially the gross margin pressures. Particularly, we use supply chain efficiencies, and we constantly do that as part of our discipline. Premiumization, innovation and RGM and value realization, as Thibaut, is a big component, of course. As we look into the second half of the year, we believe that these levers will continue to be utilized. We have, as I have said, a continuous arsenal of ideas that we put in place in terms of total end-to-end network optimization. And of course, the carryover of the pricing that we have put in place will help us offset the steel inflationary, yet diminishing commodity headwinds. We feel very good about our ability that we have demonstrated to maintain very healthy gross margins. Peter Grom : No, that\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe shifting gears to China. I would just be curious kind of what you are seeing in that market? How did performance in the quarter prepare or compare versus your expectations? And I guess maybe specifically, as you move through the quarter or around the exit rate, are you seeing any signs of improved demand that gives you confidence that there can be better performance on the horizon or would you expect trends to remain choppy there for a period of time? Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Maybe I can take this one. We have been in China for a very long time as a business. I have myself lived for many, many years in Asia. So, you are not in Asia or in China for the short-term. And I can tell you that we are positive about the long-term prospects of our business in China. When I look at our performance in China this quarter, I think it\u2019s another great example of the power of the Kenvue portfolio. I can tell you that we grew double-digit in China this quarter. Strong performance in our Self Care segment. We see softness in other categories, but it\u2019s something that we anticipated. We have never been in the camp of those who thought that China will recover overnight. Unfortunately, we have been proven right. And we would expect a slow recovery in these categories that \u2013 where we see softness today. But we are very confident in the ability of this market to continue to deliver performance, and we see that again in this quarter with double-digit growth, and that\u2019s the power of the Kenvue business model and Kenvue portfolio. Peter Grom : Thank you so much. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Jason English : Hey. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking me in and I will echo some of the other\u2019s, congrats on your first quarter as a public company. I got a couple of questions. First, let\u2019s pick up kind of where we just left off on geography. You mentioned China up double digit. I think APAC sales overall were only up 1.3%. So, what was the offset? And then as we look at EMEA, you started the year really strong with 9.3% growth and it slowed to around 3.5% this quarter despite what looks like it should have been a pretty moderate or much less owners FX headwind, can you unpack that performance there as well? Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Hey Jason. Thank you for the question and thank you for your thanks for the strong quarter we delivered. So, in Asia, we see competitive dynamics, we see category dynamics happening that had the negative impact on part of our business in the second quarter. I mentioned the mouthwash category where we see decline in both China, Japan and other parts of Asia. We are gaining share in China and Japan, but the categories are suffering, as we speak. India had a soft quarter and emerging markets in general, we saw softness there. So, that\u2019s for Asia. For EMEA, we are very pleased with the performance of our business in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Across our portfolio, we see our brands doing well, strong demand for our products in both Self Care and Skin Health. With obviously opportunities in some places as always, but overall, pleased with the performance of our European region this quarter and this first half. Jason English : Okay. Good to hear \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Paul Ruh : Sorry, Jason. You are right about the headwind still persistent of yet moderating ForEx, but the important thing is the underlying strength of the business is there. And also, we had \u2013 we continued to see elevated incidences of flu that we even saw that in the second quarter. So, it\u2019s more the core that we feel very good about and moderating FX pressures. Jason English : And let\u2019s pull on that thread of elevated flu incidences. Since you have IPO-ed, lots of conversations with investors, and one consistent question or area of concern amongst investors is whether or not you are going to enter a Self Care slump. We had sort of twin engines or twin tailwinds behind this business with COVID and then this nasty cold and flu season lifting big parts of your business. Is it reasonable to expect that there will be a Self Care slump? In other words, a period where your business is likely to contract as we \u2013 as these tailwinds fade, or is there reason to believe that you could have durable growth, and if so, what are those reasons? Thibaut Mongon : That\u2019s a very good question, Jason. That\u2019s a question that we are facing every day to plan for our operations. Our guidance of 5.5% to 6.5% growth, organic growth for the full year takes into consideration of current thinking, which is to have a normal season. So, we do not expect to have as big of an incidence as we had last winter season. We will be ready from an operational point of view to respond to any seasonal demand. But from a planning perspective, we were not planning with such a high season. Having said that, and I think the second quarter is a good example of that, our Self Care segment is \u2013 comprises more need space than just cough and cold or analgesics. And you saw this quarter other need space like smoking cessation with Nicorette like Digestive Health with Imodium or like allergy where despite a slightly lower level of incidents, we continue to gain share in the U.S. with both Zyrtec and Benadryl. All of these other segments are doing well. So, we are very pleased with the performance of the segment and very confident in the continued performance of the segment. Jason English : Understood. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Hey. Good morning everybody. Thank you. You have spoken to this a little bit, but I just want to kind of round it all out. Within Skin Health & Beauty and Essential Health, the growth in both segments came in slightly below external forecast. So, I was hoping you could put a bit more definition around how they compare to your internal forecast? I mean you have spoken to the issues in Essential Health, but just more broadly. And then I was also hoping you could just clarify for us exactly when you expect to fully cycle the portfolio rationalization headwinds that are impacting both the segments? And if possible, just within the context of that 5.5% to 6.5% organic growth call for the year, talk a bit about how you expect the three segments to contribute to that on an annual basis to give us a little bit more perspective on how the second half is likely to shake out? Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Steve, three questions, so let\u2019s put a eye and handle them one by one. Let me first maybe talk about \u2013 start with the last one on \u2013 as you know, we don\u2019t give guidance by segment. It\u2019s a reminder that really, we \u2013 the portfolio is very important, and we gave you several examples in this call again on the importance of seeing Kenvue as one portfolio focused on consumer health. We \u2013 your second question on anniversarying the discontinuation. As you heard from Paul, we are anniversarying our decision to suspend sales of personal care products in Russia this quarter. And regarding the other discontinuations of codes that we are talking about, most of them were taken last year when we discontinued slower moving codes to free up capacity in our supply chain. Having said that, we will continue to remain focused on the velocity of our cost to make sure that our portfolio is as productive as possible. That\u2019s one of the tenants of our partnership with our retailers to make sure that we continuously work with them to optimize our assortment and make sure that our assortment is as productive as possible for them and for us. So, on the Skin Health & Beauty and Essential Health segment, I would say that when you take out the impact of discontinuation and that\u2019s what may not have been fully reflected in external forecast. And I feel very good about the underlying strength of our brands and our equities in \u2013 across our portfolio. If you look at Skin Health & Beauty with volume up low-single digits this quarter with strong value realization with some room to go in terms of distribution points in the U.S. specifically, that makes us very confident in the future of this business. Steve Powers : Okay. Very good. Thank you. And if I could, just on the topic of investment levels, just curious for a little bit more additional perspective, now that you have been operating independently, just your comfort with planned investment levels and to some extent, where you expect to prioritize those investments over the balance of the year? Paul Ruh : Steve, thank you for the question. Nothing has changed in terms of our investment philosophy as we are now an independent company versus before. What we strive to do is maximize return on our investment, and we continued to invest solidly in our brands whether it is through advertising, through healthcare professional representations, promotional impact. So, we balance all of that in the most effective way that maximizes the return on investment. So, we are very encouraged by the performance and we will continue to fuel the growth of our brands through a balanced investment approach. Steve Powers : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Navann Ty : Hi. Good morning. Can you discuss and tell us more about the supply chain improvements that benefited the second quarter and do you expect them to benefit the rest of the year? My second question is, and apologies if I missed it, can you detail the breakdown of pricing versus mix within the 9% value realization? And just a third one, if you could comment on Kenvue recent dialogue with J&J regarding monetizing the stake in Kenvue with \u2013 has there been any change? Thank you. Paul Ruh : Okay. So, on the price/mix question, we don\u2019t disclose the mix between the two. On the supply chain improvement, whether we expect some benefits in the balance of the year? The answer is absolutely yes. We have invested in the more capacity and more resiliency of our supply chain. We continue to do that. As a result of that, we have significantly improved our service levels across the portfolio. Are we fully where we want to be, not yet, so it will continue to be a focus area for us to improve service levels, but we are pleased with the progress so far, and we would expect the back half of the year and beyond to continue to benefit from these investments we have made in our supply chain in terms of capacity, resiliency, automation, all working in the right direction. That will also include \u2013 that also includes even stronger partnerships with our retail partners to do some joint business planning and make sure that we get the right signal demand, to make sure that we operate our supply chain efficiently, but making sure that we have always products available on shelf for consumers when they need us. Thibaut Mongon : And Navann, on your question about the split from Johnson & Johnson, at this point, you \u2013 also that Johnson & Johnson has announced their intention for the next step of the separation of Kenvue. Unfortunately, we are very limited on the information that we can provide other than what has already been made public. I can tell you that we are fully ready. We have been operating independently, and we are very excited about the future. Navann Ty : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final questions will come from the line of Jeremy Fialko with HSBC. Please proceed with your questions. Jeremy Fialko : Hi. Jeremy Fialko, HSBC. Thanks for fitting me in the call. So, questions on advertising and promotions. So, the first one is, could you give a bit more color on what your advertising spend did in the quarter, the extent which it was up and also whether it was up as a percentage of sales? And then if you could talk a little bit about your plans for advertising spend in the second half year? And then the second question related to that is, have you seen any change in competitor behavior? Can you give examples of where you are seeing your competitors put more into advertising or more into trade promotion as the raw material prices in some areas start to ease? Thanks a lot. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Jeremy, thank you for your question. I will not comment on what other companies are doing. We live in a competitive environment. What I would tell you is that we continue to invest behind our brands. Remember that our business model relies on demand generation delivered through different means. One is direct-to-consumer demand generation activities. Another big part of our model relies on healthcare professional recommendation. And so on both fronts, we continued to invest. We are on track with our investments, and we intend to continue to invest to that level. We do not disclose advertising at a quarter level. We will disclose it on a full year basis. But you should always remember that for Kenvue, advertising expenses is only one part of our demand generation model. Another part, and important part, is linked to healthcare professional recommendation. But we are absolutely committed to invest behind our brands, that\u2019s what we have been doing in the first half, and we intend to continue to do it in the back half of the year. Jeremy Fialko : Okay. Thanks very much. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Jeremy. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Thibaut Mongon for any concluding comments. Thibaut Mongon : So, thank you for this good conversation, and thank you everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. Once again, as you heard from Paul and I, we are very pleased with the strong results we achieved and our teams achieved around the world this quarter. They reinforced the power of our iconic brands, the strength of the Kenvue operating model. So, very strong debut for Kenvue as a newly publicly traded company and we look forward to connecting with all of you again and keeping you updated on our continuous progress on future earnings calls. So, have a great day and thank you everyone. Paul Ruh : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to Kenvue's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darryl, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to Kenvue's Vice President of Investor Relations, Tina Romani. Tina Romani : Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be joined today by Thibaut Mongon, Chief Executive Officer and Director; and Paul Ruh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's call includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our operating and financial performance, market opportunities, and growth. These statements represent our current beliefs or expectations about future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially. For information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our earnings materials related to this call posted on our website and our filings with the SEC. During this call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial information. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these items to the nearest GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and our presentation available on the Investor Relations section of our company's website, kenvue.com. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Tina. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to be here with you, hosting our first earnings call as a fully independent company. Since our last call, Kenvue has formally separated from Johnson & Johnson, and we are now included in the S&P 500 Index, solidifying our place as the world's largest pure-play consumer health company by revenue. It's hard to believe it has only been two months since J&J completed their successful exchange offer given all we have accomplished this year. So in addition to delivering another healthy quarter with 3.6% organic growth this quarter on top of 4.7% growth last year, we also continued to make tremendous progress standing up Kenvue for success as a stand-alone company. From the creation of legal entities and to transfer of licenses to the development of fit-for-purpose company policies and build-out of systems, our teams continued to execute our separation plan successfully and on time. We remain on track in building a consumer-focused operating infrastructure while simultaneously bringing to life our purpose to realize the extraordinary power of everyday care and delivering profitable growth. Operating in the attractive consumer health space with an unparalleled portfolio of science-backed, healthcare professional-recommended trusted brands is what drives the resiliency and sustainability of our performance. We do all this in what continues to be a volatile environment, and we are conscious of the impact of the current geopolitical and macroeconomic situation and consumer behavior. It is our long track record through economic cycles and our performance this year that gives us confidence in the superiority of our model based on brands that are part of daily rituals and designed for moments that matter. Every day, we continue to make sure our brands are attractive for all consumers, and we cultivate their desire for our efficacious, trusted products. Similar to Q2 and consistent with what we have seen historically, while consumers may be trending down in certain discretionary categories, we continue to see strong affinity for our brands and stable private-label penetration. As a stand-alone company, our teams remain focused on advancing consumer health through innovation, bringing new options to market that consumers love, and expanding the reach of our brands in the categories we operate in. And we see this reflected in the healthy performance of our portfolio again this quarter. Starting with our largest segment, self-care. Once again, this quarter, self-care has demonstrated its ability to serve consumers with trusted solutions when they need them most. Even as unprecedented levels of cold, cough, and flu incidents started to normalize as expected this quarter, we continue to see self-care outperform the market, growing 6.7% on top of a strong 6.9% growth last year, driven by both value realization and positive volumes with all our product categories growing mid- to high single digit. Consumer loyalty to our brands, alongside investments in relevant brand activation, introduction of consumer experience, enhancing innovation, and premiumization continue to foster volume growth and share gains. Let me share some examples with you. In digestive health, our Imodium and Pepcid brands are outpacing the market as supply recovery and strong consumer demand end up in growth. As consumer preferences shift away from preventive solutions to immediate relief products, our teams strategically launched successful brand activation campaigns that capitalize on this dynamic, ultimately accelerating our share gains during the quarter. In pain care, even with cold and flu incidence levels down and a slow start to the season so far as the weather in the Northern Hemisphere remained unseasonably warm, we are gaining share this year globally through preeminent innovation and product premiumization. Tylenol, the No. 1 pain brand globally, continues to gain share with successful premiumization initiatives and the reintroduction of product activation and display supporting growth through the testament to the brand's leadership, the enviable consumer and healthcare professional trust and the strength of our teams. Another standout innovation in this category that deserves highlighting is our recently launched Motrin Dual Action product in the U.S. It combines two core ingredients from two iconic brands, Motrin and Tylenol. And the combination of these two brands is resonating with our consumers with eight hours of relief in pain and inflammation, driving share gain for Motrin. Beyond the U.S., we apply a similar winning formula around the world. In China, for example, Motrin recently expanded into more holistic fever solutions with the successful launch of new Motrin fever patches. Within allergy, while the season remained soft with lower incidence levels this year, we have continued to drive accelerated share gains globally and in our largest market, the U.S. Adult Zyrtec has maintained its No. One branded share leadership for 77 consecutive weeks now and Children's Zyrtec achieved No. 1 branded share position through an impactful go-to-market strategy and hyped-up outreach to healthcare professionals supporting the successful launch of Children's Zyrtec Chewables last year. We also drove share gains for Benadryl in the U.S. with the launch of our extra-strength formula and for our allergy portfolio in China. Smoking cessation had another strong quarter as well. In the U.K., our Nicorette team secured a new indication for vaping cessation. Early indications of consumer response have been strong with Nicorette gaining share and increasing household penetration. This new indication demonstrates Kenvue's credibility in establishing new standards in the category while also highlighting the opportunity for growth in other markets around the world. Through these examples, you see the Kenvue model at work. We continuously strengthen our leadership positions across product categories, introducing impactful innovations, bringing healthcare professionals new clinical data, and identifying solutions to help address unmet consumer health needs. And we do this successfully, extending the reach of our iconic brands to deliver sustainable growth. Before I wrap on self-care, I want to take a moment to address the U.S. acetaminophen litigation, which we appreciate late on our engagement with many of you in recent weeks, remains top of mind. As you will understand, I'm limited on what I can say on active litigation. However, even some of the noise and frankly misinformation we have seen lately, I believe we should provide some clarity. Over the past several months, it's important to note that the only meaningful development in the litigation from our perspective has been that FDA continues to maintain the same pregnancy advice on acetaminophen labels that has been in place for decades. This conclusion is based on multiple reviews since 2014 with the most recent being March 2023 that recent studies do not change FDA's view on acetaminophen's safety. For us at Kenvue, nothing is more important than the health and safety of the people who use our products. We are also concerned about the potential for real public health consequences in allowing claims made in courtrooms to influence medical decisions. Acetaminophen is one of the most studied medications in history and is often recommended by doctors as a first-line treatment option for women who have a fever or experiencing pain during pregnancy. Conditions that, when left untreated, are scientifically known to potentially have serious health consequences for both mother and baby, and we continue to stand behind the safety of our product. Getting back to the third quarter and moving to skin health and beauty, while we are executing on our plans to gradually increase performance, with organic growth about flat this quarter, our current results do not reflect our long-term ambition for the segments nor the underlying strength of our brands. There were two primary pockets of weakness this quarter in the segment which accounted for about two-third of the 6.8% volume decline : first, the continued impact of the rationalization initiatives we conducted last year; and second, the general market softness in China. Starting with the first, as a reminder, we made the decision in 2022 to discontinue certain codes to focus on the production of core lines while we were experiencing supply chain disruption. These discontinuations resulted in lost points of distribution in the 2022 U.S. retailer Planogram resets. And with Planogram resets occurring annually, our first opportunity to regain a portion of this distribution point is with the full 2023 resets which are happening as we speak. While we expect to still see an impact of the discontinuations in the fourth quarter as these changes take time to materialize in our results, it's good to see our teams securing a number of wins with the customers' resets. Moving to China. We see continued softness in that geography with Chinese consumers being more cautious on spending. As I shared last quarter, we have expected a slower recovery in China. And unfortunately, that's what we see happening. We remain positive on the long-term prospect in China, though. We have operated there many years and have confidence in the market's potential longer term, but we need to be patient as we expect continued softness in the market in Q4, and our teams on the ground will continue to be agile and allocate resources according to the opportunities they see in the market. Importantly, despite these two distinct dynamics, we were pleased to see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement when looking at organic sales on a two-year basis, which factors in some of the unique supply recovery dynamics we are lapping in the back half of 2022. If we look at the performance of skin health by geography now, in the U.S., our largest market, when excluding the impact of discontinuations, we are pleased to see sequential progress in our recovery plan with some of our core platforms gaining share. This quarter, we expanded our beloved Neutrogena Hydro Boost line by elevating our science, design, and packaging. This includes upgrading the water gel format with dye-free, fragrance-free options, alongside more sustainable packaging, and also introducing our new Hydro Boost Water Cream which delivers nine times more lightweight hydration. These two innovations are in the top three new launches in facial moisturizers, and Hydro Boost won the 2023 PEOPLE Beauty Award in this category, reflecting its status as a category prototype in hydration. We also had a strong finish to the sun season, growing more than 80% faster than the market and regaining our leadership position through experience-enhancing innovation and compelling brand activation with Neutrogena holding nearly half of the top 10 launches of the category. Building on these successes, we continue to deploy our recovery plan and look forward to sequential improvement in the coming quarters. Outside the U.S., I've already spoken about China. But in other markets, we are excited to see positive initial reaction to the reintroduction of innovation and benefits from floor resets completed earlier in the year. This quarter, we have seen skin health and beauty grow mid-teens in both Latin America and Europe. In Latin America, strong performance was driven by strength in sun, coupled with positive customer response to the Neutrogena Hydro Boost innovation I just talked about. In Europe, momentum continued in Neutrogena, and as you know, with mid-teens growth across priority markets and strong consumer response to the new product innovation our teams launched early in the year. Neutrogena is currently growing twice as fast as the category in Germany, outpacing the competition, fueled by the continued success of our Hydro Boost and Retinol Boost lines. In the U.K., Aveeno continues to accelerate its share growth with the team holding the No. 1 position in body care and also doubling its share in face care less as a year ago. With Europe being the first in the portfolio to launch innovation and completing their full reset early in the year, we believe this market serves as a leading indicator for the remainder of the globe. While we expect gradual recovery to continue, we acknowledge there is more work ahead. Our brand equities are strong, and these examples of success give us confidence that with the proper support, the segment will deliver over time a level of performance aligned to our long-term ambition. And in essential health with 3.8% organic growth this quarter, essential health continues to deliver ahead of our long-term growth goals for the segment. Our value realization and premiumization strategies continues to perform well with 10 points of value realization, offset by about 6 points of volume. And about 2 points of the volume decline can be attributed to the softness in China I just talked about with the remaining reflecting our prioritization of margin recovery through value realization, as well as certain market and competitive dynamics. Innovation in oral care, premiumization in women's health, and strength in the U.S. baby care are fueling our growth. Starting with mouthwash, we continued to see strength with Listerine Gum Therapy in the U.S. Recognizing three out of four adults suffer from some form of gum disease in the U.S., you may remember that we launched earlier this year Listerine Gum Therapy to address this unmet consumer need. Under Listerine, it's the number one oral care brand in the market. And with acceptance by the American Dental Association, we have seen immediate success post launch with Listerine Gum Therapy quickly winning and holding the No. 1 new product innovation in the mouthwash category. In addition, we also continue to see positive response from healthcare professionals with our five times flossing claim gaining traction around the world, and we see the impact in our performance. While being roughly five times larger than the next competitor Listerine continues to gain share globally through the strength of our innovation, healthcare professional recommendations, and a strong distribution network. In baby care, our global leadership in baby toiletries remained strong. Johnson's Baby and Aveeno Baby are the No. 1 and No. 2 brands in the baby toiletries category globally and are eight times and two times bigger than the next closest competitor, respectively. While we continue to see pressure in Asia, in the U.S., our largest market, we see strong growth with Johnson's Baby and Aveeno Baby gaining share with supply recovery, value realization, and the successful launch of Aveeno Kids, which is driving substantial growth, becoming the fastest-growing brand in the U.S. kids' toiletries market. Finally, in women's health and wound care, we had another quarter of solid growth. So as you can tell, our Q3 performance exemplifies the power of our portfolio. While we continue to operate in a dynamic environment, requiring agility and customer intimacy, I am pleased with the way our teams have been able to deliver on our top-line objectives this quarter and throughout the year. The same applies to the balance of the P&L, and Paul will walk you through the details of our financials. We are pleased with our ability to navigate market dynamics and deliver earnings per share in line with expectations while executing our plan to stand up our stand-alone company for success. So in closing, we delivered another quarter of healthy growth as a result of the balance we have across our intentionally curated portfolio of iconic brands, the power and agility of our operating model, and the execution of our 22,000 Kenvuers around the world. I want to take this opportunity to thank our teams for their outside-in focus, their owner's mindset, and their daring spirit. As a fully independent company, they demonstrate everyday their commitment to deliver innovative healthcare solutions to our more than 1.2 billion consumers around the globe. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Paul to review our financial results in more detail. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning, everyone. Echoing Thibaut's sentiments, I'd like to comment the ongoing passion of our people and their dedication to standing up Kenvue to be well-positioned over the long term. The energy I felt across the organization over the past several months has been inspiring. Not only have our teams made tremendous progress in executing the separation, they also delivered in the face of continued inflationary and macroeconomic pressures and a dynamic operating environment. Getting into performance, we had another healthy quarter with 3.3% reported growth and 3.6% organic growth. In terms of drivers, value realization, which is comprised of price and mix, represented 7.1 points of growth. The majority of the value realization reflects the benefit of price actions we have taken in the first half of this year with a contribution of approximately 20% from carryover actions we executed in the second half of 2022. Volume was down 3.5 points with approximately two-thirds of the decline attributed to two distinct factors : first, last year's portfolio rationalization; and second, the continued market softness in China that Thibaut spoke about. Excluding these unique dynamics, our results demonstrate consumers' affinity to our brands. Acknowledging that performance in certain pockets of the portfolio is not where we would like it to be, the fact that we were able to deliver results in line with our commitments at this early stage in our journey, exemplifies the strength and resiliency of our portfolio and operating model. This drives the reliability of our results, alongside durable cash flow generation. Transitioning to our results by segment. Strength in self-care continued with 6.7% organic growth. We continued to see strong positive value realization of 5.5 points, alongside a 1.2-point volume increase. As Thibaut mentioned, our teams continued to strengthen our self-care portfolio with a broad range of offerings from allergy and pain to smoking cessation and digestive health with all product categories contributing to growth. We've recognized that there's a lot of attention on cold, cough, and flu products as we and the entire industry lap unprecedented demand over the past few years. To date, we have observed a delayed start of the season, and we have incorporated this slow start in our outlook for the balance of 2023. We, of course, are ready for whatever the season may bring, and we'll work with our customers to ensure our products are available to meet consumers' needs. And lastly, in self-care, with regards to phenylephrine, or PE, while this ingredient has been in the headlines recently due to the ongoing FDA review, the agency has been clear that the review is not about the safety of oral PE, and they have not made a determination about oral PE in the monograph nor have they advised consumers to discontinue use. The FDA routinely reviews ingredients. And as always, we will work with the agency and our customers to ensure that we continue to offer a variety of options of both OTC and behind-the-counter solutions to serve the needs of our consumers. To date, we have not seen an impact on our business. Let me remind you, we're not the leader in the cold and flu category with products containing PE across our portfolio, representing just 2% of our global revenue and the U.S. comprising about half of that. In skin health and beauty, organic growth was negative 0.4% this quarter. Value realization of 6.4 points was more than offset by 6.8 points of volume decrease. Approximately two-thirds of this volume decline can be attributed to our portfolio decisions last year, resulting in lost distribution points this year, alongside continued market softness in China. With regards to the recapture of points of distribution in the U.S., while we are pleased with our progress and stable these costs, we don't expect to regain all of the lost ground overnight. Our expectations for gradual recovery remain the same. As we have spoken about, we prioritize sun, given the seasonality of the business, then focus on face with body and hair care next in our recovery plan. As Thibaut articulated, we have confidence in our strong brand equities as demonstrated by our performance in EMEA and LatAm. When supported by the right level of inventory, product distribution, and innovation, we see the flywheel in the business that fuels the growth. We look forward to restoring these elements across the segment. In essential health, we grew organically by 3.8% this quarter as we execute on our value realization and premiumization strategy with 10 points of value realization, offset by 6 points of volume decline. Approximately one-third of the decline can be attributed to market softness in China. Heading into Q4, we see continued momentum in oral care behind the holistic value realization plans Thibaut spoke about. Premium innovation, such as Aveeno Kids, among others, continued to perform quite well, including essential health, on track to deliver another strong quarter. Now turning to gross margins. Excluding amortization, adjusted gross margin was 59.4%, an expansion of 80 basis points versus last year. Similar to Q2, we continued to see significant, though moderating, inflationary headwinds. Positive trend in logistics and resins have been more than offset by ongoing pressures in energy and continued wage inflation. This pressure was heightened by worsening FX with further devaluation of local currencies, such as the Russian ruble and the Argentinian peso, adding incremental pressure to gross margin. FX negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 1.3 points, an acceleration from prior quarters, approximately 1-point impact. Assuming current spot rates, we expect this pressure to continue into the balance of the year that we would not expect to fully offset. During the quarter, we were able to more than offset these pressures through proactive productivity initiatives, as per plan, including procurement category cost reduction, improving supply chain manufacturing efficiencies, and leveraging digital and automation technologies. I'm incredibly proud of our talented operations teams who work in an end-to-end fashion with the R&D and commercial teams, driving efficiencies and executing successful innovation. During the quarter, we also realized some benefits as a result of nonrecurring items related to the separation as we continue to evolve to a more fit-for-purpose organization. Moving to adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income margin was 23.3% and reflects the impact of the FX headwinds I just mentioned, as well as incremental costs of being a stand-alone public company. In line with expectations and prior quarter, our stand-alone public company costs were approximately $50 million to $60 million, and we continue to expect this same level in Q4 as several of our investments are concentrated upfront in the process. We continue to expect this cost to decrease and be offset by other productivity efforts over time with total public company costs remaining in line with our initial expectations. SG&A also included expenses incurred related to the implementation of our new fit-for-purpose IT infrastructure and spend around digital capability enhancements. Moving to taxes. On a reported basis, our Q3 tax rate is approximately 25.1%. The lower reported tax rate versus prior quarter is primarily due to a change in accounting policy with regards to the treatment of global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, to be in line with peer companies in the consumer goods industry. On an adjusted basis, our Q3 effective tax rate is 25.3%. The primary drivers for this higher tax rate versus last year are, first, high U.S. tax on OUS income, net of foreign tax credits; and second, high tax expense related to prior-year return provision adjustments and tax law changes, offset by windfall benefit on share-based compensation and tax benefits related to the full separation from Johnson & Johnson. And finally, our adjusted net income was $590 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.31. In sum, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment that requires agility and where brand loyalty is rewarded. Our Q3 top- and bottom-line performance is a testament to the power of our portfolio of iconic brands and the strength of our operating model. Now moving to cash and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.1 billion and expect operating cash flow to be approximately $2 billion year to date, exemplifying our strong cash conversion. Our disciplined capital allocation philosophy remains the same. First and foremost, we responsibly invest resources in our iconic brands to drive profitable growth through marketing, R&D, and capital investments. Secondly, dividends serve as an important part of our TSR algorithm. In line with our commitments, we were proud to pay our first dividend this quarter of $383 million. And this morning, we announced that our board declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.20 per share. Third, our reliable cash flow generation allows us to prudently delever and reduce interest expense over time. Fourth, we assess potential inorganic tuck-in growth opportunities that build on our capabilities and strengthen our position as a leader in consumer health. And lastly, we use share repurchase to offset dilution from the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation. Today, we announced our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to 27 million shares of outstanding common stock for this purpose. Getting into our outlook for the remainder of the year. With the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect the impact of translational foreign currency fluctuations to negatively impact reported net sales growth by approximately 1 to 2 points. Separately, given the soft start of the cold and flu season, we are tightening our previously provided outlook, which included expectations for a more normal season. As I mentioned, so far in the U.S. and in Europe, we haven't really seen the start of the season, which we would typically see at this point in the year. As a result, we expect net sales growth for the full year to be between 4% and 4.5% and organic growth to be between 5.5% and 6%. On the bottom line, we expect full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.26 to $1.28, which also includes the higher negative impact of FX on gross margin versus our prior expectations. With regards to remaining fiscal 2023 guidance items. We continue to expect reported net interest expense to be approximately $270 million and approximately $300 million on an adjusted basis. We now expect a reported effective tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%, reflecting the change in accounting policy of GILTI taxes I previously discussed. On an adjusted basis, we expect the range to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. The higher rate versus prior year is primarily driven by jurisdictional mix of earnings and higher U.S. tax on foreign income, net of foreign tax credits in 2023 as compared to 2022. And lastly, our earnings per share range assumes a full year 2023 weighted average share count of 1.852 billion shares. A couple of notes regarding other assumptions in our guidance. As you review your models for the remainder of the year, it will be important to consider the comps in prior year, particularly in healthcare, where we are lapping a mid-teens growth as we experienced unprecedented levels of demand as a result of the tripledemic in the U.S. and a strong cold and flu season globally last year. Further, in skin health and beauty, in addition to continuing to see the impact of discontinuations until the end of the year, we will also be lapping stronger comps in the fourth quarter of the prior year as we restored supply. With regards to gross margin, in addition to the FX impact I mentioned previously, our fourth quarter gross margins are generally lower from a seasonality perspective as we typically perform our annual maintenance at our manufacturing sites at the end of the calendar year. In summary, as I reflect on the quarter, I am pleased with the way our teams continue to perform in a volatile environment while executing our separation plan successfully and on time. Operating as one team, we have been able to deliver on top line and earnings expectations year to date. This performance allows us to feel confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments for the full year and stand up Kenvue on a foundation for long-term success. Now, we will open up the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. So Thibaut and Paul, you gave a lot of examples of the headwinds that you are facing, that you faced in the third quarter and you're facing into the fourth and potentially the first quarter, I understand, given the very strong cold season last year. So can you give us like some sense of underlying consumption that you're seeing vis-a-vis what your investors should expect in 2024? I think at this point, we are all hoping to get some clarity and some of the -- your peers have given us a little bit of more color in terms of underlying. I understand, of course, if you can put aside self-care and then focus on the beauty and skin and health because some of that was self-inflicted. If you can comment on how we should be seeing and looking into 2024 in terms of balancing volumes and pricing. And just my clarification as the second part, your underlying volume decline in the quarter, if I do the math correctly, was still about 1.5%, if you extrapolate those two items that you discretely pointed out. Can you talk on how much do you think consumption would still be negative in the divisions, I would say, in particular self-care, and how innovation can play a role into 2024 given that? Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : All right. Good morning, Andrea. Thank you for your question. So a lot in your questions, so let me get into it point by point. So talking about the consumption, the underlying consumption we see in our business, we see that our consumers continue to be focused on taking care of their own health. We see strong -- continued strong affinity with our brands. We need to unpack the different puts and takes we have in our results, but you see in our Q3 results the strength of the portfolio and the strong affinity consumers have for our brands. If you look at the self-care segment, you see that all our categories are growing behind the consumer demand, healthcare professional recommendation, innovation. We continue to innovate very strongly. I gave you in my remarks a number of examples, and we intend to continue to execute this model where we strengthened our leadership positions with a continuous flow of innovation, new clinical data for healthcare professionals, and to cultivate the vibrancy of our portfolio, which is, I remind you, broader than cold and flu with vibrant business in allergy, in smoking cessation, in digestive health. So we continue to be excited about the prospect of our largest segment, self-care, understanding that we are comping a very strong -- unusually strong, as we said all along, tripledemic and very high cold and flu season we had last winter, and we will certainly not expect the same level of incidents to be replicated this year. That's why we talked all along that we were planning for a more normal season. We -- as you heard from us this morning, so far, we haven't seen really the season starting, and that's what we reflect in our guidance for this year. But we continue to be excited about the strength of the portfolio and the breadth of the portfolio. If I move to skin health, there are a lot of elements and puts and takes here. So that makes it a bit more difficult to understand our performance, so let me unpack it for you. For Q3, we are first lapping a relatively strong Q3 of 2022 with 4.7% organic growth last year as we began to rebuild service levels. On top of that, we have the impact of the discontinuations we did last year. Those were known and expected. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we expect to continue to see some of that in Q4 as Planogram resets are becoming effective in the U.S. and around the world. And we see the Chinese consumer being -- continuing to be very choiceful and cautious about where they spend their money, and that affects demand in this market. So these three elements are really masking all the bright spots that we have in of -- in health segments. You heard that Latin America and Europe are doing very well. We concluded in Q3 a very strong sun season in the U.S. And as we have said all along, our skin health business has been disrupted. We are in -- executing our recovery plan. We're not expecting an overnight improvement. The recovery will be gradual, not linear. We started with sun for the obvious reason, to catch the season. We are now moving to face and body. Lubriderm is doing well. We are launching a number of innovations, especially under the Hydro Boost range in the U.S., and we'll continue to move with body and hair being next in line. So are we -- do we believe that our current performance reflects our long-term ambition for the segment? Absolutely not. But are we confident that the cadence of our recovery plan is on track? Absolutely, and you are going to see that continuing in 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Steve Powers : Hey, great, and good morning. Thank you very much. A few questions. So Thibaut, maybe to pick up on your last thread there, just maybe a little bit more detail, if you could, around the expected phasing of distribution point recovery in skin health and beauty. I appreciate the phasing of face and then body and hair. But how much progress is this as a way to quantify a recovery of those lost distribution points should we expect in this first phase? And how long do you think it will take to fully recover overall? That's question number one. Question number two. I guess as we step back and maybe, Paul, this is for you, just given the slower cold and flu dynamic that you've called out, the China backdrop that you've called out, as well as currency headwinds, I guess have you altered at all your investment plans or investment levels in marketing or other commercial demand-building initiatives because of those headwinds? Or are you still planning to invest as you were before and perhaps offsetting that with other forms of productivity or the like. Thank you very much. Thibaut Mongon : Good morning, Steve. So let me take the first question, and Paul you take the second one. So in terms of recovery, as I said, we expect the recovery to continue to be gradual, not to be linear. You see the dynamics in the China market. It is an important market for skin health. We don't expect the market to improve soon and certainly not in Q4. In terms of distribution points in the U.S., the Planogram resets are happening as we speak. They happen in the fall. We are pleased with the wins that our teams have been able to get as part of the Planogram resets. It takes a little bit of time for these resets to materialize in our results, so you are going to see some initial impact in Q4 and then going up from there into 2024. But I cannot reinforce enough, as I've said all along, that it's not going to be an overnight improvement. It's a plan that we have planned for 2023 and 2024, and what matters for us is to make sure that we continue to be on track with the execution of this plan. Paul, do you want to take the second one? Paul Ruh : Happy to. Yes. Thanks, Steve, and great to talk to you. So our priority number one is to make sure that we keep the flywheel turning. Therefore, as you saw in the results of Q3, we put a lot of emphasis on productivity, and you see that reflected in our gross margins because we don't want to miss on the opportunities to invest where we see the growth. And our model, our operating model allows us to do that. What we do is when we see opportunities to invest with high rate of return, we move the resources to that place. And if the season is starting slowly, we move the resources to where we see the season or the other opportunities for growth already there. So we have not changed our investment plans overall. Our focus is to deliver on the productivity to maintain those investments where they make most sense in terms of return. Thibaut Mongon : And I would add, you see that reflected in our innovation program in Q3, and we have a lot of exciting innovation lined up for Q4. You will see more displays and brand activation with Tylenol. I talked about our innovation Motrin Dual Action that is doing very well and allowing Motrin to gain share. You will see brand activation around Neutrogena Hydro Boost range, in particular, and continued activation in Europe as well. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Two questions. I'll start with a change of topic over to cold and flu. We heard P&G last week, double-digit growth on Vicks, really good sell-in there. And we heard from Reckitt, who also talked about really good sell-in around cold and flu. Your message is obviously contrasting pretty sharply with that, and I guess it's a little unclear why. Two potential explanations : one, your sell-in is weaker, suggesting like maybe retailers are planning for a little less support behind you than your competitors; or secondly, like maybe sell-in is fine. You're just looking around the corner, saying sell-in is good, but the season looks soft, so we're going to plan for less pull-through as we look forward. So can you help provide a little more clarity on how we reconcile those and which of those potential scenarios is most close to the truth? Thibaut Mongon : Jason, good morning first. You are absolutely right in your analysis. We have the second scenario in mind. That's what we are seeing. We see ourselves and our retailers ready for the season. Everybody is prepared for the season, and that's reflecting in the sell-in, and that's reflecting in the strong performance of our self-care business in Q3. Having said that, when we look around the corner and look at signs of start of the season, we have not seen that so far given the very warm weather we have seen in the U.S., in Europe. And so that's what we are reflecting in our outlook, not so much the sell-in. That is, as always, good to make sure that everybody is ready for the season but more what we see on the ground in terms of start of the season. Jason English : Understood. Paul Ruh : And a couple of points to add maybe, Jason. The first one is our readiness compared to what it was before is much higher. We have actually increased our capacity in several lines and also in our IT infrastructure to be able to connect much better with our retailers. So when the signal is there, we will be ready to react. That means that we, on a total end-to-end value chain, we're able to optimize inventories for the benefit of us and the retailers as well. So we will be ready, and the situation is much better after the learnings that we had from the previous pandemic years. Jason English : Helpful stuff. Thank you, and congrats on the success you're seeing in skin health and beauty in Europe. I like what you said. I hope that is indeed an early indication of what the U.S. could look like when all these initiatives take hold. You mentioned that the cadence of the improvement is on track. It doesn't -- from the outside looking in, it doesn't seem like that's the case at all. We spoke last quarter about the cadence of the destock -- or sorry, not the destock, the rationalization that happened this quarter last year. You're supposed to come out of this quarter having fully cycled that. And in fact, you're supposed to come out this quarter with now more products slotted in on shelf resets. So this was supposed to pivot from a headwind to almost net neutralize this quarter as a tailwind in the fourth quarter. Now you're saying no, not the case. It's actually going to be a headwind again in the fourth quarter. So something's gone wrong. The shelf resets must not be going as well as expected or there's other discontinuations elsewhere. Help me understand kind of what's been -- what's derailing this path of improvement. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. So let me take this one. On skin health and beauty and the recovery of distribution in the U.S., as you know, the Planogram resets happen in the fall. So we are just going through the resets, as we speak, right, in the U.S., depending on which customer you are talking about. As I said, we are pleased with some of the wins we have had with these resets, and you are going to see improvement but not immediate. That has always been our plan, and we are in -- we are seeing continued impact this quarter. You are going to see continued impact in Q4, less and less as the Quarter 4 and forwards as we -- as these new Planogram resets materialize in our numbers. So you have a lasting impact of this loss of distribution points. But you're right, we are recovering gradually, as we said all along, through Planogram resets, through launch of innovation. And that's what we saw with sun, that's what we're going to see again in face and body, and hair will be next. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : Hi. Good morning, and thank you for the question. On self-care, volumes were a bit better than expected despite the more normalized or slower start to the cold and cough season. We've noticed that you've gained market share nicely in the self-care categories over the past two years. So even if we do see a softer winter season overall, should we expect volumes to continue to be bolstered by those market share gains? Thibaut Mongon : Anna, good morning. Good question. I think what -- you rightly said that we have consistently outperformed the market for a long time now in healthcare, and you continue to see that happening. You also see the power of the portfolio, our broad-based portfolio in self-care covering multiple categories. So in terms of volume, we certainly continue to expect our nonseasonal categories to outperform with innovation, with strong brand activation and execution around the world with customers and healthcare professionals. With regards to the cough, cold, and flu season, given the totally abnormal high season with the tripledemic we had last year, as we said all along, we would not expect the same type of volume to materialize this year. So no change in this area. We continue to grow and fire on all cylinders on the nonseasonal part of the portfolio. For the seasonal part of the portfolio, we will see where the season goes. What I can tell you is that within this season, we are absolutely ready to be extremely competitive. Paul mentioned about our supply capacity that has been expanded, and we are absolutely ready to have -- to be very competitive this season. Anna Lizzul : Thank you for that. And I also wanted to follow up on skin health and beauty. You did mention in your prepared remarks you are introducing some innovation within the Neutrogena brand. Is that helping you add or regain distribution? And then just in terms of the innovation, given that's typically more premium in nature, year over year, the pricing slowed this quarter versus last year. I'm just wondering why that was given the innovation that you introduced. Thibaut Mongon : So absolutely, you're right. We are introducing innovation around the world. I talked about the positive impact that this innovation had in Europe. If you talk about Neutrogena, Germany is a great example where our new Hydro Boost lines and Retinol Boost lines are doing extremely well over there. For us, this fall and winter, our hydration line, Hydro Boost, which is really the hero line in hydration for Neutrogena, is strengthened, I would say, with the innovation we are launching this quarter with our new hydrogel cream and new options within our hydrogel gels -- Hydro Boost gels, sorry. And this allows to have a halo effect on the entire Hydro Boost range, and you will see displays and brand activations for the entire range beyond the innovation but building on this innovation. So absolutely, innovation is part of our algorithm for success and helps us activate brands in a much bigger way in store and online. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, everyone. Question on China, obviously you talked about being a headwind in the quarter. Can you give us some sizing of the -- your China business and some color on where your main exposure is but on a segment basis? And longer term, clearly, the macro picture is still challenging there, but like what are your expectation of improvement in China consumer trends and your business performance there? Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. China represents about 7% of our global revenue, Filippo, so that gives you a sense of our exposure to China that is not disproportionate, I would say. We see, as I said, a couple of consumers to be cautious and choiceful in their spending, and we see that reflecting in our portfolio of skin health. And essential health segment has been impacted by this behavior in China, and we don't expect short-term recovery in that area. On the other hand, on the self-care side, we continue to see vibrant demand for our brands, in allergy, analgesics, as an example. So a lot \u2013 again, the power of the Kenvue portfolio that allows us to continue to be confident in the long-term outlook in this market. We continue to innovate in this market. We -- I talked about Motrin fever patches and as an example of the type of innovation we are launching in the market. So for China, the power of the portfolio will continue to be agile and move resources to see -- to the areas where we get a good return. Clearly, today, it's more in the self-care side than in other parts of the business. But our teams on the ground are agile, and we'll continue to be ready. We have been in China for decades. We are in China for the long term, and we remain confident in the long-term prospect of this market given the size of the middle class, the Healthy China 2030 agenda, and other underlying factors in that market. Operator : Our final questions will be from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Susan Anderson : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if maybe you could talk about just the input cost inflation. You called out still pressuring gross margin. Is that still higher costs flowing through, just kind of wrapping around? Or have things elevated further? And then maybe if you could just talk about between commodity costs, labor, etc., what the drivers are there when you expect it to potentially fall off. Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Susan. And as I said, we still see some elevated inflation, although it is slowing down. If you think about the pockets of our cost spine, we still see some elevated inflation in particular in two areas. Number one, it's in energy and labor. On the areas where we see the declines, it's already in resins, hydrochemicals, logistics, a significant decline given the normalization of the -- particularly the freight lines, both in -- on the sea and on land. So overall, we see a diminishing inflation. We are also adjusting our pricing accordingly. Remember, asset principle, we are aiming to maintain our gross margins through value realization and premiumization to ensure that we maintain our gross margins and nothing more, so we have healthy margins to be able to invest back in our brands. So that's our principle. We're living into it, and we are seeing the inflation diminishing, which is a good thing. Susan Anderson : Great. And then if I could just add one more also on the beauty and skin segment. Just the operating income, it looks like there was increasing deleverage there. Is that mainly from just lower sales? Or is there something else going on there, too? Thibaut Mongon : In the case of skin health and beauty, if you look at our margins, we are focusing our efforts on improving our gross margins to be able to create more fuel for growth. The other thing that is particular in our business is we moved the resources around. And when we see the opportunity to invest, like in this case, when we see the new innovation, we're actually moving resources to be able to drive that innovation. In the end, it's a temporary, more phasing matter when it comes to the quarterly margins. But if you look at it on a normalized basis, on a full year basis, you will not see those ups and downs. It's just how the phasing of our advertising spend, but we are focusing our efforts on the healthy gross margins to be able to invest back in our brands and not only in skin health but in general. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Thibaut for any closing remarks. Thibaut Mongon : So thank you, everyone, for participating to today's call. Once again, as you heard from Paul and I, we are pleased with our third quarter results. It was another healthy quarter for Kenvue. We believe they reflect the strength of our model, the power of our portfolio of iconic brands with operating results and strong cash flow generation, underscoring the strength of our position in the consumer health space. So we look forward to connecting with all of you again to keep you updated on our continuous progress on our future earnings call. So have a great day, and thank you, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello. And welcome to the Kenvue Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tina Romani, Head of Investor Relations for Kenvue. Tina Romani : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be joined today by Thibaut Mongon, Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Ruh, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's call includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our operating and financial performance, market opportunities and growth. These statements represent our current beliefs or expectations about future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially. For information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our earnings materials related to this call posted on our website and our filings with the SEC.  During this call, we'll also reference certain non-GAAP financial information. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a subject for financial information presented in accordance with US GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of these items to the nearest US GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and our presentation available on the IR website. With that, I'll turn it over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Tina. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2023 was a year of transformational change for our company and for 22,000 Kenvuers around the world. Our teams accomplished a tremendous amount, successfully standing up Kenvue as an independent public company, while continuing to drive profitable growth. While we accomplished a lot in 2023, we know we have areas where we need to increase our focus and improve. So as we enter 2024, we have identified three key priorities that will enable our continued transition as an independent company, while continuing to grow the business.  This year, we will reach more consumers, with a stronger focus on our 15 priority brands, free up resources to invest behind our brands and foster a culture that rewards performance and impact.  In 2023, we delivered on our long-term value creation algorithm centered around profitable growth, durable cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation. Our 5% organic growth was broad-based across all three segments, all four regions, and all eight product categories. Self Care delivered another banner year of 8.4% organic growth, sustaining the momentum we have built over the past several years, resulting, once again, in strong revenue growth and share gain.  Essential Health grew ahead of our long-term expectations, with 3.6% organic growth, while continuing to execute our strategy to drive gross margin enhancement through successful value realization and premiumization initiatives.  And in Skin Health and Beauty, organic growth was 1.8%, less than we expected, mostly due to specific missteps around in-store execution in the US, which we are actively addressing, and I'll give you more details about that in just a moment.  We continued our successful multiyear program to expand gross margins in 2023 with 30 basis points of expansion through thoughtful revenue management initiatives and relentless supply chain optimization. This further demonstrates that we have the capabilities and the strategies in place to drive profitable growth even in a dynamic and uncertain macro backdrop. And finally, we utilized our strong free cash flow to initiate our dividend program, delivering on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders.  Pivoting to Q4 specifically, let's now have a look at the performance of each one of our segments, and I'll start with Skin Health and Beauty as our disappointing fourth quarter's performance on top line clearly fell short of expectations, both yours and ours.  Looking by region, it is evident where we have strength to leverage and where we need to improve. EMEA and Latin America ended the year strong. In EMEA, organic growth improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter on positive consumer response to innovation launched earlier in the year. In Germany, for example, Neutrogena Hydro Boost has fueled growth ahead of the category.  In Latin America, where we continued to grow double digits, Neutrogena faced doubled sales in the quarter, supported by the successful launch of Hydro Boost refills. In China, weaker consumer demand continued to pressure the overall category in our skin care brands. However, it is our performance in the US that did not meet our expectations. As we have talked with you about, we had ambitious fourth-quarter recovery plan for the US, but, frankly, the execution of this plan was disappointing. Restoring Neutrogena to the level of growth we know the brand is capable of is a priority for me and for the team. So over the past several months, I spent significant time with our team in the US and engaged with our customers as the diagnosis is clear. We know our brand equities are healthy and our products resonate with consumers in the category. However, we must improve our in-store execution capabilities to drive stronger demand for our brands, better communicate our value proposition to consumers, launch innovation successfully, and finally, support our brands with a robust level of marketing investments. In early December, we shared that Jan Meurer, previously our Chief Growth Officer, will assume the position of Head of North America. With Jan's deep knowledge of our portfolio and our growth strategy, he has already outlined with his team the focused road map that they are executing to strengthen their capabilities and stabilize the business.  Specifically, the recently redesigned North America Skin Health and Beauty leadership team is taking action in three areas. First, we are strengthening in-store presence and prominence through better planning with customers, enhanced packaging that clearly articulate dermatological benefits and more prominent in-store brand activation.  Second, we are enhancing consumer engagements through distinct and consistent brand experiences delivered with the appropriate level of reach and frequency and supported by a revamped marketing effort. And third, we are amplifying innovation through bolstered demand-generation activities with consumers and healthcare professionals. So, this will not be an overnight shift. It will take time for these actions to generate impact on our results, which we expect to occur in the second half of the year, but we are confident we have correctly diagnosed our weaknesses and are making the necessary changes.  Additionally, we believe our strong partnerships with retailers, coupled with increased investment and a higher level of precision in our execution, will enable us to stabilize the business in the US and deliver stronger growth in 2024.  So now turning to the rest of the portfolio. In Self Care, our largest segment, it's a very different picture. We ended the year in line with our expectations, delivering organic growth of 8.4% in 2023 on top of 10.9% growth in 2022. We continued to demonstrate our leadership in the fourth quarter, reading the season accurately and activating our brands with precision.  Adult Tylenol continued to gain share in the US, with 78 consecutive weeks of share growth even as category volumes declined as expected with roughly 15% lower incidence levels this cold and flu season compared to 2022. And again, this quarter, we strengthened our leadership positions with relevant innovation, premiumization and leading healthcare professional endorsement.  So looking to 2024, we intend to continue to deploy this winning formula around the world. And finally, in Essential Health, performance was led by oral care and women's health, while baby care shipments were less robust this quarter. Oral care grew 8%, with organic growth in all regions, including the US, where Listerine, despite being around five times bigger than our next competitor, remains the most productive brand in the category and has now delivered 21 weeks of double-digit consumption growth. The launch of Listerine gum therapy has done extremely well as the largest innovation in the US mouthwash category in 2023, reaching 1 point of share in 12 months just for this code. And we have more great innovation planned in 2024. Which brings me to our priorities for this year. 2024 will be our first full year as an independent company. And you will see us starting to operate differently than what we have in the past, which will enable us to unleash the full potential of our portfolio.  As I shared earlier, we have three priorities : First, we are going to reach more consumers, with a strong focus on our 15 priority brands. We are strengthening our plans to build attractive, consistent brand experiences for our 15 priority brands, which represent two-thirds of our growth.  With strong retailer partnership, we will bring to market relevant innovation across the segments, driving mental availability, but also ensuring physical availability where and when our consumers need us. We are also raising our bar in terms of activation excellence in our focus markets, starting with the US. So you are going to see our top brands with a higher level of activation in 2024 as we fuel growth. In Self Care, we have strong plans to bring forward science-based, category-leading innovations to meet the needs of consumers, maintain category-leading healthcare professional recommendation, and ultimately, drive continued share gains.  And in Skin Health, we will stabilize the business in the US with the plan I outlined today. Outside the US, in China, we will monitor consumer sentiment and thoughtfully calibrate our investment accordingly, while in the rest of the world, where we continue to fuel our growth in Europe and Latin America. This requires investment, and we have plans to invest more in brand activation in 2024, both with consumers and with healthcare professionals. Continued margin expansion and efficiencies across the business will fuel this investment.  Which brings me to our second priority, which is to free up resources and invest in our brands. We expect gross margins to expand at an accelerated pace compared to 2023, which will fund increased investment in our brands. You've heard me say that, over the past several years, we have been going to the gym on gross margin. And through this work, we will continue to strengthen this muscle, driving efficiencies across our supply chain, managing our mix, and implementing thoughtful revenue management initiatives.  In addition, as we exit our transition services agreement with Johnson & Johnson, we are not simply replicating legacy processes, but rather intentionally reinventing our ways of working. And this includes implementing modern systems designed specifically to meet the needs of our new company and enable speed, agility, accuracy, and a lower cost base. For example, we are implementing a new integrated business planning process that will improve our demand forecasting capabilities and service levels through better integrating and automating retailer data and demand sensing. This plan will be implemented throughout the next six quarters, with the majority occurring this year. And all of this will be enabled by our teams around the world, which leads me to our final priority, fostering a culture that rewards performance and impact. In 2024, we are deploying our new Kenvue performance management plan, with clear goals and a heightened sense of accountability for every Kenvuer. The plan introduces new incentive programs for all leaders, encouraging and rewarding impact on the four drivers of shareholder return \u2013 top line growth, margin expansion, earnings growth, and free cash flow.  Further, we are streamlining decision-making across the organization, including in my own leadership team. And most importantly, we are creating a culture based on our Kenvue values where everyone has a strong sense of purpose and belonging, an opportunity to grow, and is rewarded for impact. So in closing, we made significant progress in 2023. And while we still have a lot of work ahead of us, our priorities are clear in 2024 and give me confidence in our ability to deliver our plan for the year.  I'm deeply grateful to our talented teams for their energy and passion to work together as one team to build our new company. It is inspiring to see 22,000 Kenvuers rally behind one purpose, helping people realize the extraordinary power of everyday care, and I know they will make us successful this year and into the future.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut. And good morning, everyone. 2023 was a transformational year, where we delivered strong top line, gross margin expansion, and robust cash generation, even in the face of a dynamic macro backdrop and significant cost headwinds.  I will start with an overview of results for the fourth quarter and the year, then close with our outlook for 2024. As you heard from Thibaut, fourth quarter performance did not meet our expectations as in-store execution fell short of plan in the US Skin Health and Beauty business. While we don't expect recovery overnight, I'm encouraged by what the new leadership team has accomplished in the past couple of months, diagnosing the issue and putting an action plan in place that is already underway.  Now getting to results. Fourth quarter organic sales declined 2.4%. It's important to consider our fourth quarter performance in the context of 6.2% organic growth last year, where we experienced outsized growth in Self Care, primarily driven by unprecedented demand for our OTC products. In this context, fourth quarter growth was 3.8% on a two-year stack basis. Value realization contributed 5.8 points to fourth quarter growth, offset by a volume decline of 8.2 points.  Let me deconstruct the volume decline as there are several unique drivers impacting volume that do not reflect the underlying strength of our brands. First, about 3 points come from lapping an early and strong cold, cough and flu season that drove double-digit organic growth last year. Further, this year saw a later start to the season, combined with approximately 15% lower incidence levels. As we have shared previously, in parts of our OTC business, volume is characteristically linked to incidence levels, which can go up or down in any given season. For Kenvue, our focus is to be prepared to serve our consumers, while continuing to gain share, regardless of what the season may bring, and that is what you saw from us this quarter.  Second, 2022 product discontinuations negatively impacted the quarter by about 1 point. Of note, as of the fourth quarter, we have fully lapped the product discontinuations and do not expect to see any impact next year.  Lastly, trade inventory reduction accounted for about 1 point as retailers tightened their inventory levels. In sum, a little over 5 points of volume decline is attributed to idiosyncratic elements of the fourth quarter, with the remaining 3 points mainly attributed to continued softness in China and our underperformance in US Skin Health and Beauty we have discussed. For the full year, net sales grew 3.3% to $15.4 billion. Organic growth of 5% reflects the value realization of 7.7% and a volume decrease of 2.7%, of which approximately 2 points is attributed to the 2022 product discontinuations we have discussed all year and the suspension of personal care products in Russia through the first half. When normalizing volume to exclude these two distinct items, volume was slightly down on nearly 8 points of value realization, demonstrating the low elasticity of our brands. You also see the power of the portfolio in the fact that private label penetration remained relatively flat throughout the year, even as consumers look to be trending down in other categories. These dynamics give us confidence in our ability to improve volume growth as we progress through 2024. Moving to gross margins. Fourth quarter gross margin expanded 220 basis points to 59.5% and full-year adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to 58.4%.  As we have discussed with you previously, there are some non-recurring items in our results, as we refine our accounting and reporting methodologies to be more comparable with our peers. Impacts from these refinements were a benefit of approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter and 10 basis points for the full year.  Inflationary headwinds moderated during the fourth quarter, as positive trends in logistics offset ongoing pressures in energy and wage inflation, while FX continued to pressure gross margin by about 1 point during the quarter and for the full year. Turning to adjusted operating income. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income margin expanded 190 basis points and full-year adjusted operating income margin was flat. Adjusted operating margin benefited from the non-recurring items I just spoke about by about 180 basis points for the quarter and 70 basis points for the year.  For taxes, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 15.8%. The decrease versus prior year is primarily the result of tax law changes that negatively impacted 2022, the release of tax reserves, mostly due to statute of limitations expiring and benefits from effective tax planning. The full-year adjusted effective tax rate was 23.4%. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate versus prior year is primarily due to the release of tax reserves.  And finally, adjusted net income was $586 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.31 for the quarter and $1.29 for the year, including an approximate $0.03 benefit from the non-recurring items I spoke about.  Now turning to cash and capital allocation. For the year, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow. It is worth noting that the free cash flow benefited from separation-related items and the timing of working capital at the end of the year. During the year, we demonstrated our commitment to disciplined capital allocation, as outlined during our IPO. We strengthened our balance sheet, reduced our leverage, and returned cash to our shareholders. We have executed on our capital allocation priorities, including a 64% dividend payout ratio and reducing our gross leverage from 2.5 times to 2.2. As you model 2024, it will be important to consider the working capital timing benefit in 2023 as well as the fact that we'll be paying a full year of dividends and have a full year of interest expense, which brings me to the outlook for 2024. First, I want to echo Thibaut's point that we have strong conviction in our ability to execute our plan for the year. We have a clear strategy in place. And in 2024, we are focused on reaching more consumers, optimizing the way we work, to invest behind our brands, and rewarding performance and impact. We will drive efficiencies through further investments in supply chain, technology, and a recently implemented integrated business planning process. We will then redeploy the dollars generated from these operating efficiencies into consumer-facing brand support. Volume growth and market share capture will be of particular focus for this incremental investment.  And finally, we will accelerate the exits of TSAs, establishing a new operating infrastructure that meets our needs as an independent company.  In summary, it will be a year focused on enhanced engagement with consumers, while continuing our transition to a truly stand-alone entity. In 2024, we expect to achieve organic growth in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect quarterly organic sales growth to improve sequentially as we progress through the year and as compares ease and as impacts of the strategic initiatives that Thibaut outlined begin to materialize.  We expect certain headwinds to continue in the first half of 2024, such as a lower flu season versus last year, softness in China and persistent impact of in-store issues with our Skin Health and Beauty portfolio. However, as we accelerate investment behind our brands, particularly focused on in-store presence and prominence, enhancing consumer engagement and amplifying innovation, we expect to see growth accelerate as these actions begin to have more of an impact in the second half of the year.  We also think it's prudent to acknowledge that 2024 could be another volatile year as economic and geopolitical headlines impact consumer confidence. The lower end of our guidance reflects the potential for a weaker consumer and the possibility for unknowns in our seasonal businesses. Looking to the first quarter, we expect organic growth to be about flat. While we don't plan to guide quarterly as part of our normal practice, given the outsized performance in the first quarter of 2023, which benefited from non-recurring retailer inventory rebuilds, combined with a strong cold, cough and flu season, we thought it would be helpful to provide perspective on Q1.  Moving down the P&L. We expect to maintain a healthy gross margin profile, with adjusted gross profit margin expected to be closer to 2021 levels. We expect adjusted operating income margin to be slightly below last year. While the operating efficiency we spoke about begin to materialize, partially offsetting the increased investment in our brands that includes an approximately 15% increase in our marketing spend as well as the absorption of a full year of public company costs.  Regarding other guidance items and EPS, at current spot rates, we expect translational foreign currency impact of about 1 point to reported net sales. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $400 million, evenly split across quarters. We expect an adjusted tax rate of 25.5% to 26.5%, which reflects the changes in tax loss, primarily the enactment of Pillar Two legislation adopting the OECD's global minimum tax.  Regarding EPS, assuming a full-year 2024 weighted average share count of 1.92 billion shares, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. This range assumes about a $0.04 foreign exchange headwind based on current rates.  To show a comparable view across years, we have included a slide in our presentation that outlines a rebased starting point for 2024. In other words, a like-for-like view had we been a public company for the entirety of 2023. This rebased view includes a full year of public company costs, a full year of interest expense, and a normalized tax rate and share count.  At the midpoint, our earnings per share guidance is about flat when comparing to the rebased 2023 adjusted diluted EPS. In closing, we are proud of what we have achieved in our first year as Kenvue, while also acknowledging challenges in our Skin Health and Beauty business that we have plans in place to improve. As for 2024, our priorities are reaching more consumers, freeing up resources to invest behind our brands, and fostering a culture that rewards performance and impact.  Thank you. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Maybe to start just on the top line. I think just given the momentum that we have exiting 2023, I think some people could look at the call for flat organic in the first quarter, given the comparisons as ambitious and also the 2% to 4% for the full year as potentially ambitious. So maybe just a little bit more color on your visibility to that organic forecast and some of the building blocks that we should be looking for as we get into the year. Thibaut Mongon : Regarding your question on the top line and our ambitions for 2024, we continue to see our categories growing 3% to 4% in 2024 and beyond. Our guidance for 2024 reflects a range of scenarios. It does embed a sequential improvement as we move through the year and as we lap the unusual compares of 2023 that we talked about, but also the fact that we expect our increased investment and the plans that I outlined earlier generate impact, especially in the second half of the year. So that's what makes us confident in our plan for the year. But we also think it's prudent to acknowledge some of the dynamics at play in 2024, and that's why our guidance also contemplates certain headwinds that could materialize, such as further softness in China, the time it will take to improve in-store execution in Skin as well as the possibility for unknowns in our seasonal businesses. But I reiterate that we are confident in our plans for the year. Stephen Powers : Maybe this is for Paul on the margin forecast. I guess just some clarifications. The press release talked about the strong gross margin outlook that you talked about just a few minutes ago as well. But it contemplates 50 basis points of FX headwinds. I just wanted to clarify, is that 50 basis points all within SG&A? And maybe you can give some color as to the drivers of that transactional headwind in SG&A, number one?  And number two, you talked about year-over-year rates of increase in advertising. I guess I'm a little curious as to where we finished 2023. I'm sure it's going to be in the K, but maybe just give a little color on where advertising finished as a percentage of sales in 2023 and how you expect that to trend into 2024? Paul Ruh : In regards to your first part of the question, yes, we are very pleased with our gross margin trajectory. As you know, and Thibaut mentioned, we have developed a muscle in terms of continued sustained gross profit margin enhancement. And the FX that I talked about is embedded in gross margin and also in SG&A, but primarily in gross margin. To your second question, year-over-year rates of advertising, we will disclose advertising in our K. Advertising year over year versus 2022 was slightly down. But I can tell you that we have very strong plans to increase our advertising. I mentioned 15%. We're approximately $300 million more that will fuel the progressive growth enhancement that Thibault talked about. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anna Lizzul of Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : I wanted to ask on Q4 Skin Health and Beauty. I know you said the volume weakness was mostly driven by the US. But can you be more specific on how much of the weakness was driven by China on Dr.Ci:Labo? And are you expecting this to recover in Q1 in terms of your guidance?  And then also in the US on Skin Health and Beauty, in Q3, you had highlighted some innovation in sun care for Neutrogena, which helped last quarter, but volumes saw a significant deceleration here in Q4. So in terms of the recovery in distribution, where are you at in your conversations with retailers? Thibaut Mongon : So let me answer your question on Skin Health and where \u2013 what do we see in China and the US. So in China, we saw a weak demand for our brands, especially Dr.Ci:Labo due to temporary PR issues that you are familiar with. We believe that these PR issues are dissipating as we speak. But we are going to be thoughtful about continuing to monitor how the categories are doing, how the consumer sentiment is going in China. And while we are going to see gradual recovery in 2024, we are not contemplating in our guidance a strong recovery, especially in the first half of the year in our Skin Care brands in China.  I remind you that China is about 7% of our revenue as a total company, but we have our total portfolio represented in China, and Skin Health is not the largest part of our portfolio in China.  Regarding the US, we had an ambitious recovery plan in Q4. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the outcome of this plan was not what we expected.  What's good is that we understand exactly what is going on. Our brands are healthy. Neutrogena, for example, has a very high penetration in the US. Our online sales are doing well. We grew double-digit on Amazon with a brand like Neutrogena, for example.  So what we really need to improve is execution, and Jan and his team are laser-focused on improving this execution. And it's going to be broad-based. It goes beyond just distribution, but it starts with our in-store presence and prominence. And here, I'm talking about better on-shelf execution, increasing displays, increasing fixtures, updating the packaging where needed to make our range easier to shop, making sure that we have the price back architecture everywhere and, ultimately, making it easier for our consumers to shop in-store for their needs. It's also about engaging with consumers in a bigger way than what we did in 2023. We have industry-leading ROI on advertising. So, really 2024, it's about increasing the reach and frequency of our engagement activities \u2013 brand activation activities with both consumer and healthcare professionals. We are going to put more products in their hands, think about samples, because we know that once they try our product, they'll love them.  And lastly, we will deploy innovation at a bigger scale, amplifying our 2023 programs, and we are excited about what we have in the plan for 2024 in terms of innovation. And retailers are excited about it as well.  So, in a nutshell, it's a heightened focus, more precision around execution, more presence with consumers, amplified innovation. As I said, it's not going to happen overnight. The recovery will not be linear, but we are confident that this stronger plan will help stabilize the business. And with, again, a higher level of precision in our execution, we expect growth in 2024 to definitely be ahead of 2023. Anna Lizzul : And if I can ask a follow-up on Self Care in Q4. Just outside of cold, cough and flu, could you comment on the rest of the portfolio? I think you had mentioned last quarter you were seeing some gains in your other categories. So I was wondering if there are some bright spots there? Or if they were also somewhat of a drag in the quarter? Thibaut Mongon : It's a great question because we talk a lot about the season and Paul described very well the dynamics there and how pleased we are with our performance during the season, but the strength of our leadership position doesn't happen by accident. It's an outcome of a lot of work that permeates throughout the entire Self Care portfolio, and that's true for analgesics, but it's also true for allergy, for digestive health, for smoking cessation.  And in these other areas of the business, we are very pleased with our performance. We see continued performance in smoking cessation, good performance in digestive health. Allergy, while we had lower incidences, strong share gains on innovation, like Zyrtec chewables continues to do very well. So our strong performance in Self Care is broad-based across the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : I have a question and a follow-up. Thibaut, can you elaborate more on the time of the displays? You just mentioned the fixtures and the shelf space recovery in the US, in particular, ahead of the spring. I heard that a large retailer is probably moving some of the beauty restock into the summer. Is that impacting your expectations, number one?  And number two, like you had mentioned you're seeing progress throughout the year, which obviously has to do also with the comps. But is it fair to assume flat to slightly negative Q1 or first half of the year for organic turning positive, potential inflecting in Q2 and then the second half of the year is where we should be able to see significant progress on that?  And a follow-up, in terms of the shipments against consumption on POS, I know it's hard to really focus on Nielsen, but unfortunately, that's what we can see in terms of consumption. Should investors expect that track channel data will remain weak for most of the first half of the year and should start to see better trends toward June and July, given the reset? Or are you confident that with the innovation that you called upon, all the work that you have done to simplify the SKUs and also lapping those SKU simplifications, which is probably going to be a tailwind, all else equal? So should we be seeing slightly better than progress as you look in the first quarter against fourth quarter? Thibaut Mongon : That's a big question, Andrea. It's an important one. So let me unpack your question in terms of phasing in what we plan to see unfolding in Skin Health and Beauty for the year.  First of all, I think the way you are describing the year is directionally correct. We are not guiding by segment, by quarter. But I think the way to describe the phasing throughout the year is directionally correct and in line with the way we see it, given the noise you have in the comps. You talked about the impact of discontinuation, the suspension of our sales in Russia in the first half of the year, these are going to be tailwinds in terms of growth rate. But we have headwinds like, for example, in Q1, the large replenishments we saw in retailer inventory once we got out of the majority of our supply chain issue in the back half of 2022. That's going to be a headwind for us. If you exclude these comp dynamics, what we are laser-focused as an organization is deploying the plan that I just highlighted, and making sure that we execute with precision. That does include the stronger presence in-store, but that also includes amplifying our reach to consumers and healthcare professionals. And so, that's where you will have different phasing of the impact of these different aspects of the plan throughout the year.  I can tell you that we are executing our higher investment plan in terms of media as of January. So you will see a lag, as we all know, between the spend in advertising and the consumption that has already started. In terms of in-store activation, that will happen throughout the year, depending on the rhythm each retailer has. So, we are laser-focused on executing these building blocks.  You also mentioned that we are doing very well online, where the brand experience is very strong, and we grew the brand, like Neutrogena, double digit. That's something that is not easy for you to track, but that continues to be a source of strength for us. And so, we are laser-focused on the tracked channel, if you will, which is what you see and which is where we have the biggest area for improvement. Andrea Teixeira : If I can squeeze one question for Paul in terms of like the cadence for gross margin. You did call out the TSA/TMA phasing, and I understand it's about $100 million potential savings. Is that fully included in potentially second half? Should we think about, okay, part of it be impacted in this outlook for operating margin being flattish given all the investments that you're making? So in other words, whatever you gain this year is going to be reinvested into marketing and the 15% that you called out in A&P. And then you're still going to have more benefit into 2025. Is that the way we should be thinking? Paul Ruh : Yes. Directionally correct, Andrea. As you know, gross margin is the result of several elements, including value realization. We have about 60% of the value realization as a carryover from last year, and we will take surgical pricing in addition to another 40%. So that's one in addition to premiumization and mix.  And also, the efficiency that we talked about. In addition, of course, you have the inflation and forex impact. Inflation is still positive, but it's coming down. So you will see a progression to contribution to gross margin enhancement in terms of that inflation.  We're exiting TSAs as we speak. Day by day, we're talking about hundreds of TSAs, and that impact both our gross profit line and also our operating income line, and those are spread throughout the year, where you will be seeing is the investment starting right out of the gate. Some of that will bear fruits later. If it's more equity advertising or promotional spend will deliver the benefits in the shorter term. So that's how I see the cadence. So it's definitely more of a \u2013 it's a balance with an enhancement toward the second half, and we intend to continue that into 2025. We're not running into 2025, but that philosophy of heightened investment should continue beyond 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni of Citi. Filippo Falorni : I wanted to go back to the question on marketing investment. I think the initial plan was to spend more in 2023. But I think, Paul, you said advertising was slightly down in 2023. So maybe what drove, I guess, the decline?  As you think about the investment into 2024, can you give us a little more concrete examples of where you're spending the advertising by product, by category, and your expected ROI on those investments? Paul Ruh : Let me start with the first part of the question, and maybe I'll turn it over to Thibaut for your second one.  Particularly, the investment in advertising, yes, was slightly down year-over-year, and that was primarily the result of a reduction in Asia-Pacific, where we did not see investable propositions towards the back half of the year. But looking into 2024, investing in our brand is a key priority to fuel the growth. I mentioned approximately 15% is about $300 million more. We want to start out of the gate. And the most important thing is our philosophy of maximizing ROI is what we're going after. And it will be applied to all the categories as long as we see those investable propositions, and we maximize ROI across the portfolio. Thibaut, anything you want to add? Thibaut Mongon : Filippo, this overall investment is broad-based to activate our brands with consumers and with healthcare professionals. So I remind you that our advertising line only captures part of our investment to activate our brands as everything that's related to healthcare professional engagement is not reflected in that line.  In 2024, we are going to increase our investment in both areas. And we are going to apply this additional investment across the portfolio, but very focused behind our 15 priority brands that I highlighted in my prepared remarks. So, it's a very focused plan, but with more fuel behind a philosophy that Paul highlighted of extremely high ROI. We have, I believe, industry-leading ROIs on our marketing investment. This is a capability that we have developed over the years with state-of-the-art analytics, systems and capabilities. So we intend to continue to use this disciplined approach to deploy a higher level of dollars. And so, that's, once again, what makes us confident in our ability to deliver the plan we outlined this year. Filippo Falorni : If I can follow-up quickly on the Skin Health and Beauty segment. That is a segment that has been underperforming over the last couple of quarters. You mentioned, obviously, this quarter, the challenges. I guess can you review a little bit more like what are you changing in the way you manage this business? And what gives you the confidence in the improvement as you get through 2024 for Skin Health and Beauty? Thibaut Mongon : Filippo, what's very clear about Skin Health and Beauty is that the opportunities to improve are really isolated to two areas \u2013 two important areas, but two areas. One is the China market. And the other one is, I would say, in-store performance in the US. So our plan is laser focused to improve our performance in these two areas, while we continue to fuel growth in the other areas where it's working well, namely Europe and Latin America. So, in China, it's not entirely in our hands, and that's why I talked about our position to thoughtfully track how the categories are developing in that market, make sure that we do not invest ahead of the curve to get a strong return. So we are monitoring consumer sentiment. And as we see the right conditions for our skin care brand in China, we will invest appropriately.  In the US in-store, what's different in 2024 compared to 2023 is a higher level of precision in the execution, the heightened focus. I can tell you that many people in the organization are focused on this plan. The plan that Jan, our new leader for North America, and his team, with the support of the entire organization, have put together and started executing, as we speak, is very precise. And this heightened focus, increased level of precision, and higher level of investment, again, we would expect this to deliver stronger results, especially in the back half of the year. It's not going to happen overnight. But over time, we are confident that we are going to see the full potential of our brands being unleashed in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Anderson of Canaccord Genuity. Alec Legg : Alec Legg on for Susan. Lot of color, so thank you for that. But on the gross margin, you said you expect it to get to fiscal 2021 levels. I guess, what are the key drivers of those gains in fiscal 2024 versus 2021? And how should we think about how that progresses through the year? Thibaut Mongon : It's a great question and one that I'm happy to talk about because this is an area of strength for Kenvue. And we've been on this journey of increasing our margins and enhancing our margins through a complete suite of levers that include value realization and efficiencies throughout the value chain since 2019. I would actually say that we are managing our gross margin profile in a very competitive way. And I would say, above average compared to our industry peers.  If I think about the dynamics of the balance of the year, I would continue to see all those things \u2013 continued value realization, mix management, premiumization. We are starting to see some of the tailwinds of the inflation now that were previously headwinds. Although we still have forex, something that we are mindful of, the efficiencies that we have in place and the discipline that we have in terms of managing that value chain will allow us to continue to \u2013 in this journey of driving gross margin enhancement. Alec Legg : Potentially a quick follow-up. Are you able to comment on the acetaminophen lawsuit? It seems like the judge had a positive ruling for the defendants. Tina Romani : We really don't have any update there. We're going through the process to dismiss the MDL. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Navann Ty of BNP Paribas. Navann Ty : We understand low marketing expense drove the underperformance in the product activation. But was there something else, such as not the right product display, or maybe the packaging not highlighting enough the healthcare recommendation would be helpful to know. And what are the right levels of overall SG&A and maybe R&D to address that? Thibaut Mongon : Let me take this one. I think, overall, the execution of our recovery plan in the fourth quarter fell short of expectations on a number of elements that I talked about. In a nutshell, it's making sure that our brands are more prominent in-store, easier to shop and supported by the appropriate level of engagement activities, both at the consumer and healthcare professional level. While all these elements were included in the plan, the level of investment or the precision of the execution was not what we expected, and the outcome was not what we expected.  Now lessons learned. All these lessons are included in the buildup of the plan for 2024. And that's why you see us in the US executing a plan that is different from what we had in 2023 in these different dimensions. And so, you will see this broad-based activation plan put in place.  But I would say, if you think about the three priorities I outlined for the company more broadly in 2024, you will see a different Kenvue in 2024 compared to what you saw in 2023. It's going to be our first full year as an independent company. And so, you will see, especially our 15 priority brands, being activated at a much higher level in 2024, with strong building blocks across these 15 brands and across our three segments. You are going to see us being much more agile and moving with speed and urgency to capitalize on all the opportunities we see in the market and unleash the full potential of our portfolio. That requires investment. That investment is going to be fueled by the continued and, I would say, accelerated gross profit margin enhancement that Paul referred to.  As we exit our TSAs with Johnson & Johnson, it's also an opportunity for us to reinvent the way we work, work faster, better, make it easier for our teams to operate, but also do it at a lower cost base. And this combination of expanded margin and efficiencies in the organization is what's going to fuel this investment and allow us to fuel growth in 2024.  Now, the year will be a bit noisy due to the unusual compares we have in 2023. But if you look at the underlying strength of the business and the building blocks we have to drive growth in 2024 and profitable growth in 2024 and bring our long-term algo to life, we are confident in our plans. Navann Ty : Can I ask actually a follow-up on the litigation? If you can discuss at all the next steps to end the litigation? Tina Romani : Navann, like I said, there's really not much I can share. We're going through the process, now that the court has granted our motion to exclude expert testimony. So we're going through the process to allow the court to determine whether the cases are dismissed. Operator : Our final question for the day comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : I guess I had a more conceptual question on the guidance. But over time, we've kind of seen some of your staples tiers that have underperformed from a top line perspective or a share perspective. We kind of rejigger investments to try and fuel growth. In many cases, that coincides with rebasing earnings to set the company up for a stronger growth, not in the current year, but more in future years. Is that what's going on here? Like, has your thought process on the need for investment and innovation evolved versus where we were six, nine months ago? Or has this kind of earnings performance been contemplated for some time?  I guess as a follow-up to Steve's question earlier on the organic growth. Is the flat performance in 1Q a function of weaker category growth and the improvement just is something that the category accelerates? Or is the underlying improvement assuming that your performance relative to the category improved substantially? Because it would just seem that if you're kind of exiting the year at more mid-single-digit growth that that would imply some pretty decent share gains. So just any color on kind of the share assumptions would be helpful. Paul Ruh : To answer quickly your Q1 question, Peter, and we included in our slide deck a slide that I think you will helpful as you model 2024 with all the puts and takes in the different quarters of 2023. You will see that Q1 has a number of items that are going to make the compares very challenging for us. So, it's really about a unique event that happened last year. I talked, for example, about the inventory replenishment, but also the fact that we expect the season to continue to be below last year as we exit the winter, similar to what we have seen in Q4 of 2023. So, it's a mix of unique items to what happened at Kenvue last year and a continued lower level of incidence in Q1, similar to what we saw in Q4.  To your broader question about whether or not we are changing our philosophy, I would say our commitment to our long-term algorithm is stronger than ever. Our commitment to deliver strong TSR through a 3% to 4% top line growth year over year, growing earnings faster than share and having a disciplined capital allocation strategy is what we started deploying in 2023. You are going to see, as we moved through 2024 and 2025 and also we become fully independent and exit our transition service agreements with Johnson & Johnson, you are going to see this long-term algorithm brought to life in a meaningful way. And that was always the plan to make sure that we exit our TSAs and reinvent our ways of working. So, we make it fit for purpose for our company, with ways of working that fit what we need to be successful as Kenvue, but also do it at a low base. And the combination of this lower cost base and the continued improvement in gross margin that we have demonstrated our ability to do for years, again in 2023, and we're having to do it again in 2024. This is what brings a fuel to bring more investment to our brands.  There is no limit to our investment in our brands. We are very disciplined in our approach. We go for a return on investment approach. We believe that we have strong investable propositions in terms of building blocks and activities for 2024, as an example. And that's why we feel confident that the higher investment that we mentioned will give us good results in 2024 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Thibaut Mongon for concluding remarks. Thibaut Mongon : All right. So thank you all for participating on today's call. 2023 was, as we talked about, a transformational for Kenvue. I think we have been very clear about our priorities for 2024, reaching more consumers, investing in our brands and foster a culture that rewards performance and impact. So we look forward to updating you throughout the year as we continue to advance these efforts.  And for now, have a nice day. And thank you again. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to Kenvue First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tina Romani, Head of Investor Relations for Kenvue. Tina Romani : Good morning, everyone and welcome to Kenvue's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to be joined today by Thibaut Mongon, Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Ruh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's call includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our operating and financial performance, market opportunities and growth. These statements represent our current beliefs or expectations about future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially. For information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our earnings materials related to this call posted on our website and our filings with the SEC. During this call, we've also referenced certain non-GAAP financial information. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to the nearest U.S. GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and our presentation available on our IR website, investors.kenvue.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Tina and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to be here with you this morning to discuss our solid start to the year with Q1 results coming in ahead of expectations. Earlier this year, I shared with you how we are committed to transform our organization with 3 clear strategic priorities in 2024 : Reaching more consumers, freeing up resources to invest for growth and fostering a culture of performance and impact. Our teams around the world are focused on executing with precision the changes required to bring these 3 priorities to life. And everywhere in the organization, you start seeing Kenvue shaping up as a different company. We are early in this journey and this transformation will not happen overnight but this quarter's encouraging performance, the key program initiated throughout the organization and the high level of employee engagement, do reinforce my confidence in our ability to deliver the plan this year and deliver our long-term value-creation algorithm from 2025 onwards. The solid financial performance this quarter, beginning with our 1.9% organic growth on top of 11.2% last year, reflect the power of the Kenvue portfolio and the quality of our people. As anticipated, volumes are not yet a contributor to our growth with a 3.1% decline versus prior year and we are not yet where we want to be in Skin Health and Beauty. But at the same time, we continue to strengthen our leadership position in Self Care and our innovations are a strong contributor to our growth in Essential Health. And we do all of this while exiting TSAs, reinventing our ways of working, freeing up resources to invest behind our brands and nurturing our new culture of performance and accountability. All of this positions us well for the future. So let's have a closer look at our progress on each of our 3 strategic priorities. Beginning with reaching more consumers and starting with our largest segment, Self Care, let me first share with you what we see in the Self Care market. We see consumers continuing to look for science-based, efficacious solutions to take care of themselves and their loved ones. But this quarter, volumes were affected by 2 factors : First, the cough, cold and flu season was shorter and slower than last year. And second, we saw some U.S. retailers reducing their inventory levels. These factors will continue to have a meaningful impact on Q2 volumes and in a quarter where we will lap tough compares, will mask the underlying strength of our brands. In this context, our teams delivered outstanding performance. In Self Care, we delivered 4.2% growth on top of 15.3% growth last year and continued to outperform the market, owing to the breadth of our portfolio in terms of categories and geographies. In the U.S., for example, each one of our largest brands grew share during the quarter. Tylenol, the number 1 pain care brand in the world, achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of share growth in the U.S., further widening the spread between us and our next competitor. Regardless of the intensity of the season, our objective is always to advance the category and continue to gain share. And this is what our teams actively pursued this quarter despite a softer season, with stronger media investment, expanded distribution and a significant increase in in-store display support. We also continue to launch category-leading innovation. This quarter, we launched Tylenol Easy to Swallow with Gentleglide technology with the aim at helping approximately 20% of people who hesitate to take a pill. We are activating the same playbook in allergy. While the category is down so far this year on colder weather and sporadic storm patterns, Adult Zyrtec is the only brand in the category increasing penetration and has now been number 1 in value share for 102 consecutive weeks. Similar to Tylenol, you see Zyrtec building on its category leadership ahead of the season with expanded distribution, strengthened in-store execution with a higher number of displays and continued excellence in health care professional and consumer engagement activities. This quarter, we also relaunched Zyrtec Oral Dissolve Tablets that melts in your mouth and dissolve in seconds, a strong benefit for consumers in oral antihistamines. And we actively deploy the same recipe in the rest of the world and see the same strong performance in Asia with brands like Tylenol and Motrin growing double digit in China. Or in Europe, with brands like Imodium or Microlax in Digestive Health and Nicorette in smoking cessation driving double-digit growth. All of this as a result of the precision in the execution of our brand activation plans by our teams in each market. So another solid quarter for our Self Care brands. Next, moving to Essential Health, where we grew 4.9% this quarter on top of 4% last year. The team's focus on executing initiatives to reach more consumers and expand our categories is yielding positive results. In Oral Care, where Listerine is 5x larger than the next name competitor, we see growth across all regions. In the U.S., our scaled business has now delivered more than 63 weeks of continued consumption growth and we are not stopping there. At CAGNY, I told you about our launch of Listerine Clinical Solutions, our new premium line of alcohol and non-alcohol mouthwash focused on specific health benefits which is a great example of what we do to expand the categories in which we are leaders. Early reads indicate this innovation already accounts for 0.6% share of the U.S. market and is highly incremental, bringing 72% incremental shoppers to the Listerine brand. You see us doing the same thing in the baby category. Our global leadership remains strong with Johnson's Baby and Aveeno Baby as the number 1 and number 2 brands in baby toiletries globally. We are now expanding our penetration in children's toiletries, building Aveeno Kids as the fastest-growing brand for children in the U.S. We see an opportunity to develop this new market where we are seeing increased demand. And we will continue to deploy this strategy across the segment with relevant innovation powered by increased investments, precise in-store execution and expanded distribution. Now moving to Skin Health and Beauty, where we saw our business declined 4.5% in the quarter with a 6.9% decline in volume. As we have discussed, stabilizing this business is a key priority for us. In the U.S., our team is activating a 3- pronged approach : Increasing in-store presence, elevating consumer and dermatologist engagement and amplifying innovation. While more work needs to be done and it is too early to see results, I'm encouraged with the progress the team is making against each priority and I believe we are moving in the right direction. The U.S. team is laser-focused on strengthening in-store presence and prominence through better planning with customers, enhanced packaging that clearly articulates dermatological benefits and more prominent in-store brand activation. For example, the teams have moved quickly to improve the awareness and shopability of Neutrogena Hydro Boost water cream, the latest Neutrogena innovation launched last year. New packaging with updated graphics is underway; media investments are up nearly 15%; and in-store, we implemented on-shelf signage that more effectively communicate our product's dermatological benefits to shoppers. As part of our strategy to increase our impact with dermatologists, Kenvue showed up strong at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting in March, where more than 10,000 dermatologists came together. We presented 22 new pieces of scientific research and hosted a panel moderated by Neutrogena brand ambassador, Jennifer Garner, to showcase our science-led approach to innovation. We amplified our presence on social media and achieved number 1 share of voice, ahead of all other skin care brands. With a positive showing at AAD, coupled with expanded detailing sales force and a significant increase of our in-practice sampling, we quickly won 3 points of dermatologist recommendations for Neutrogena face and moisturizing treatment, regaining our position as the number 1 recommended brand by the dermatologists in this category. We are also strengthening consumer engagement through compelling and modern marketing campaigns appealing to young consumers. A good example of this is the activation of our partnership with the Coachella Festival in April, where Neutrogena was the exclusive sun care partner. Beyond offering great sun protection to the more than 650,000 festival-goers with over 120 gallons of sunscreen, the Neutrogena team amplified our activation on social media and through influencers, earning number 1 share of voice in the U.S. skin care category during the festival, similar to what we achieved at AAD the month prior. We are encouraged by the early indications that we are moving in the right direction. That said, we are not where we want to be in terms of market share. The recovery will take time and will not be linear but as you can tell, we are laser-focused on executing on our plan to improve our market performance and better reflect the strength of our brands. To amplify these efforts, during the quarter, we announced a decision that will allow us to operate in a more integrated manner. Recruitment for a new global segment leader to be located in the U.S. is underway and we are in the process of relocating our Los Angeles office to New Jersey, where our brand team will work side-by-side with R&D to drive innovation, cohesive execution and growth. Now moving to our next priority, freeing up resources to invest behind our brands. As discussed with you previously, we continue our journey of transforming Kenvue from a segment of Johnson & Johnson to an independent company focused on accelerating growth. This quarter, we started investing more behind brand activation, where we see opportunities to unlock profitable growth, in line with our plan to increase our investment by 15% in 2024. And we fund these investments through the continued expansion of our gross margins and the transformation of our cost structure as we exit TSAs. I'm pleased with the progress we are making on both fronts. Adjusted gross margin expanded 290 basis points in Q1, adding to our strong track record in this space and freeing up resources to invest in the brand activation plans I described earlier. In parallel, we are taking action to structurally change our cost base, leveraging the unique opportunity we have in front of us as we exit TSAs. You will hear from Paul more details about our view forward our program to become a leaner, more agile and fast-moving organization ultimately with a lower cost base. The team are focused on executing with precision this program that spans over 2024 and 2025. We are at the beginning of this journey but every day, we seek Kenvue transforming a bit more into a company focused on unleashing the full potential of its portfolio of brands, better positioned to deliver on our long-term algorithm of earnings growth ahead of sales growth and durable cash flow generation. Which brings me to our third priority : To foster a culture of impact and performance, where we are moving in the right direction, transforming our company operationally and culturally. Starting with strategic alignment, we rallied all Kenvuers behind our 3 company priorities via our robust goal-setting process, part of our new approach to performance and pay. In addition, we clarified the responsibilities and decision rights throughout the company. We streamlined processes, encouraging faster decision-making, improved execution, heightened accountability and enhanced collaboration. As we continue our journey to grow Kenvue into the undisputed leader in consumer health, we are intentionally bringing in high-performing external talent. A couple of weeks ago, I was pleased to announce that Russ Dyer will be joining my leadership team as Chief Corporate Affairs Officer; an important leadership role as we continue our journey to grow. In addition to instilling an owner mindset across the organization to elevate operational performance, we are also committed to operating the business responsibly. With the understanding that human health is inseparably linked to environmental health, during the quarter, we affirmed our commitment to our Healthy Lives Mission, our ESG strategy aiming to advance the well-being of both people and the planet. And last week, we announced that Kenvue's near-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science- based Targets Initiative and this in less than 1 year since becoming a public company, demonstrating our team's passion and commitment on this front. We look forward to publishing our inaugural Healthy Lives Mission Report in June, where you will see how Kenvue is maximizing its impact for good. So as you can tell, you are starting to see a different Kenvue in action in 2024. We are off to a good start for the year. Our teams are laser-focused on our 3 strategic priorities, we are making progress on our journey to transform our company, all of which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our plans for the year and execute on our long-term algorithm in 2025 and beyond. Before I turn it over to Paul, I would like to thank our Kenvuers around the world. Every day, they help consumers realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. They embrace change and are actively contributing to our transformation. They are the ones delivering the results I just shared with you and it is an honor to work alongside such a great team. And now over to you, Paul. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut and good morning, everyone. I'll start by echoing Thibaut's sentiment that I am proud of how our teams are coming together. Our colleagues are embracing change, rallying behind our transformation and executing on our strategic priorities, all while delivering strong results this quarter. Our teams began executing against our first priority : To reach more consumers. Across the portfolio, we deploy more relevant, impactful and distinctive brand experiences. We're beginning to see a difference in how our portfolio is coming to life in store and with our consumers. Now this work is just beginning but we are energized by the opportunities we see to continue strengthening our relationships with new and existing consumers all around the world which brings me to the next priority : To free up resources to invest more behind our brands. In our press release this morning, we announced that our Board formally approved our initiatives to build on Kenvue's strength and optimize its cost structure. This initiative is part of our program to optimize the way we work. We call this Our Vue Forward. Thibaut spoke about the unique opportunity we have to reinvent with work and lower our cost base as we exit TSAs with J&J. Our Vue Forward equips us to do 4 things : First, to optimize our geographic footprint to drive connection, collaboration and synergy across our teams and maximize our service hubs. Second, to eliminate redundancies across the organization as we broaden spans of control and reduce layers of hierarchy to drive faster decision-making, creativity and innovation and more effective organizational communication. Third, to implement new systems and automation to strengthen our capabilities in areas, like our ability to uncover and apply consumer insights, improving forecasting and responding real-time to market dynamics. And finally, to better leverage our procurement partnerships, ensuring we build strategic relationship with our suppliers that are rooted in shared value creation. As an example, next week, we will bring our top suppliers from around the world together with our team to share knowledge and align on priorities. Our Vue Forward will enable Kenvue to operate more effectively and ultimately more competitively. We have already begun to realize efficiencies to support our investments in 2024 and expect the ongoing annualized benefit after full implementation of the initiative to be approximately $350 million per annum beginning in 2026. This initiative will result in a net reduction to our global workforce of approximately 4% and we expect to incur restructuring costs totaling approximately $550 million, split roughly evenly between 2024 and 2025 with a payback period of approximately 18 months. Importantly, as I am sure you may have the question, there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. Our healthy balance sheet allows for strategic investment in our business for growth, our number 1 priority, in addition to commitments to a strong dividend, our delevering program and share buyback to offset dilution. In this unique moment of transformation, we believe Our Vue Forward will generate the greatest long-term value creation for our stakeholders, accomplishing 2 goals : Reducing our cost base; and as importantly, allowing Kenvue to deploy best-in-class ways of working that move us towards our ambition to become the undisputed leader in consumer health. These initiatives, along with continued adjusted gross margin improvement will enable us to fund incremental $300 million investment behind our brands that we committed to in 2024. As such, there is no change to our adjusted earnings per share guidance. Beyond this year, this initiative will continue through 2025, supporting continued incremental investment behind our brands while staying aligned to the delivery of our long-term algorithm centered around earnings growth ahead of sales growth. Moving to our first quarter results which demonstrate progress against our third priority : Fostering a culture of performance and impact with heightened accountability. Coming in ahead of expectations, first quarter organic sales growth of 1.9% was strong, particularly when considering our 11.2% organic growth last year. Momentum in Self Care and essential health continued, partially offset by underperformance in Skin Health and Beauty, as anticipated. Value realization contributed 5 points to growth with approximately 75% carryover and the remaining coming from new value realization primarily outside the U.S. It's important to note that even as volume is at the forefront of conversations today, value realization will continue to play an important role in our growth algorithm as the superiority and the efficacy of our products fosters loyalty in our categories and specifically with our brands. Now talking about volume. Volume improved meaningfully from fourth quarter trends across all segments, in line with our expectations. Taken together, approximately 2/3 of the 3.1% volume decline is attributable to the expected lapping of a onetime inventory rebuild last year and the impact of retailer trade inventory reduction by some U.S. customers this year. We have continued opportunity here and we expect volume to stabilize and grow in the second half of the year. Now let's take a look at our segments. Self Care performance was strong at 4.2% organic growth on top of 15.3% last year. Notably, we continue to gain share even on strong value realization of 5.6 points. As Thibaut mentioned, this performance reflects not only the diversity of our portfolio and strength across geographic markets but also consumers' ongoing demand for efficacious health solutions they trust. Volumes were down 1.4 points, driven entirely by the lapping of a large onetime inventory rebuild as retailers replenish supply following the tripledemic last year. As you consider your models for Q2, in addition to factoring the strong 2023 compare of 14.2%, there are also a couple of unique dynamics to bear in mind. First, in Europe, due to a shorter cold, cough and flu season this year compared to a more prolonged season last year, we do not expect the same level of replenishment that we saw in 2023. Second, in Asia Pacific, we do not expect the same level of incidence in China, where we experienced a large surge following the reopening last year. And lastly, in the U.S., we expect continued trade inventory contraction at some retailers. Given these dynamics, alongside the soft start to the allergy season that Thibaut spoke about, we expect growth to be low single-digit negative in Q2, masking the continued strength of in-market performance we expect to see in the quarter. We remain confident in the underlying strength of the Self Care sellers portfolio and there are no changes to expectations for growth to accelerate in the back half, particularly as we lap easier compares. Moving to Essential Health, where momentum continued. Organic growth of 4.9% was comprised of 6.8 points value realization, partially offset by 1.9 points of volume decline. Similar to self-care, the strength and diversity of our Essential Health portfolio fueled our growth. Thibaut shared a few examples of how we are driving growth in Oral Care and Baby Care. We are doing the same thing in our Women's Health businesses across EMEA, LatAm and Asia Pacific. In India, for example, we are seeing strong growth in our Stayfree brand through consistent efforts in premium product distribution expansion, supported by strong media presence as we build strength in the growing women's health category internationally. Overall, Q1 performance and sequential volume improvement reflect the value of our brands to consumers and we are confident in our ability to drive growth for the year. Moving now to Skin Health and Beauty. While Q1 performance is in line with our expectations, as Thibaut discussed, our results do not demonstrate our ambition nor the full potential of our brands. Organic sales declined 4.5% with 6.9 points of volume decline, partially offset by 2.4 points of positive value realization. The U.S. Skin Health and Beauty team is heads-on focused on stabilizing the business and we are still a few quarters away from seeing the impact of this work in our results. However, what I am seeing today is a team that is operating differently. As Thibaut mentioned, we are in the process of bringing our U.S.-based teams together under one roof to drive more collaboration and innovation. We are increasing our engagement with health care professionals, with dermatologist recommendations increasing for Neutrogena Face. We're also increasing engagement with our customers. For example, last week, we met our customers at NACDS to collaborate on long-term innovation pipelines. Simply put, the teams are executing the plan that we laid out at the start of the year with focus and energy to stabilize the business in this year. We are seeing encouraging signs but we certainly recognize there is more work to do. Moving to adjusted gross margins. Value realization alongside continued executional excellence in supply chain productivity drove 290 basis points of margin expansion as our teams have accelerated efforts to free up resources and generate the fuel to invest behind our brands. This quarter's strong performance benefited from moderating inflation which was a slight benefit as market favorability in logistics, energy and agrochemicals outpaced increasing labor pressure alongside slightly favorable currency movements. We have a strong track record of preserving and expanding gross margin and you can expect that to continue as we move through 2024 and beyond. At the start of the year, we shared that we expected adjusted gross margin to near 2021 levels or 59%. Given where foreign exchange and net input cost inflation have moved, we now expect to be slightly above this level, though recognizing the environment in terms of inflation and FX continues to be volatile. Turning to adjusted operating income. First quarter adjusted operating income increased 70 basis points to 22%. This increase is primarily due to strong gross margin, partially offset by incremental stand-alone public company costs that we did not have in the first quarter of last year and increased investment behind our brands. Let me clarify what we mean when we say increased investment behind our brands. We are referring to advertising investment as well as consumer and product promotion and health care professional spend. It is important to note that, similar to our U.S. peers but the difference from some of our international peers, our advertising disclosure in our 10-K only represents our pure advertising spend : Digital advertising, television, radio and print media. The disclosure does not include other consumer or product promotion or health care professional spend. When we speak about our $300 million incremental investment, we are referring to the increased brand investment across all 3 categories of spend. Now as you think about SG&A for the remainder of the year, given our increased investment behind our brands, it is fair to assume SG&A as a percentage of net sales will be at similar levels as Q1 for the remainder of the year. Interest expense net for the quarter was $95 million, in line with our guidance. For taxes, the first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 28.3%. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate versus the prior year is primarily attributable to jurisdictional mix of earnings, release of prior year tax reserves due to statute of limitations expiring and negative impact of share-based compensation in the current period. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5% to 26.5% which reflects changes in tax laws as well as tax-optimization strategies that the company intends to pursue. And finally, adjusted net income was $547 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.28. On a like-for-like basis, normalizing for interest expense, public company costs, share count and tax rate, earnings per share grew 7.7% versus last year which brings me to the outlook for the remainder of the year. We are maintaining our outlook for organic growth in the range of 2% to 4% and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. This range assumes about a $0.04 foreign exchange headwind based on current rates. Our outlook balances our solid first quarter while acknowledging macroeconomic dynamics impacting consumer confidence. Our guidance also considers the possibility for unknowns in our seasonal businesses, including sun; allergy; and cold, cough and flu. As we talked about, Q2 has a few unique dynamics, including strong compares an expected U.S. retailer trade inventory reduction that will impact our results. We continue to expect an acceleration in the back half of the year as compares ease and our plans take hold. All other guidance metrics which can be found in the slides accompanying our remarks, remain unchanged. In summary, I would like to leave you with 3 key takeaways : We had a strong start to 2024; we're executing against our strategic priorities for the year; and we have the right plans, talented people and strategic investments in place to deliver our long-term algorithm. Thank you. And with that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thibaut and Paul, you both mentioned that the destocking in the Self Care business will likely continue in Q2 and you gave some color on what to expect in organic sales growth. But in terms of how we should be thinking across the divisions in terms of the Skin Health and Beauty, is that something we should -- I understand that there is still a job to be done and it takes time and you mentioned, Paul, a couple of quarters or several quarters, I think, was the language. But should we expect things to improve sequentially? How we should be thinking of Skin Health and Beauty as we progress? Thibaut Mongon : All right. Andrea. And so many questions in your question, let me take the first one very quickly on inventory. We mentioned that we saw an impact of the inventory reduction in some U.S. retailers in Q1 in Self Care but across categories, I would say. And we expect this to continue in Q2 but not last beyond Q2 in terms of this Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing some technical difficulties. Please stand by. [Technical Difficulty] [Operator Instructions] Tina Romani : Hi, everyone. Apologies for that. We had some technical difficulties in our room. We will just go back to Thibaut answering your first question from Andrea. Thibaut Mongon : All right. So Andrea, I was responding to your question. I'm not sure how much you got out from my answer. I would start -- go back to the beginning, your question about retail inventory reduction and potential impact in Q2. We see -- we saw an impact in Q1 of the retail inventory reduction with some retailers in the U.S. in Self Care but I would say across categories. And you would expect this impact to continue into Q2 but not beyond the first half. Regarding your question on the Skin Health segment and how -- what we should expect moving forward in Skin Health. Our diagnostic has not changed. I've always said that our recovery would not happen overnight, will not be linear. We have developed a thoughtful plan. It's a priority for us. Jan and his team in the U.S. are laser-focused on executing this plan, the objective to stabilize brand in 2024 with improving volumes as the year goes on and deliver growth from 2025 onwards. It's early. It's early but I'm encouraged, as you heard in my remarks, with what I call the anecdotal evidence that we are moving in the right direction. We saw this quarter once again that when we activate our brands properly, whether it's with dermatologists or consumers, we see a response, a pretty quick response. Now we know that we will need more of these activities to have an impact at scale on the business. And we also know that these activities take time to translate into sales and share gains. But we should -- we are definitely hyper-focused on executing the plan in the balance of 2024 to stabilize this business through our focus on in-store presence and prominence, our focus on elevating consumer and dermatologist engagement and on amplifying innovation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : So I wanted to ask because we're hearing from some of your peers that they're seeing a step-up in promotional intensity and they're expecting this going forward. So could you talk about what you're seeing in your markets and some of your key categories and if that's consistent? And basically what your approach will be for the rest of the year. And then how do we think about this in the context of robust gross margin delivery in the quarter? And finally, how does that feed into your expectations for continued contribution from net price realization going forward? Thibaut Mongon : Yes. So what do we see in our categories? We see that our categories continue to be resilient and strong, that's probably unique to -- linked to the unique nature of the consumer health categories compared other stable categories you may be familiar with. In our categories, consumers are looking for efficacious solutions at a compelling value proposition but it is exactly what we offer at Kenvue. If I look at one indicator which is the penetration of private label in our categories, we don't see that moving around the world. Actually, the penetration was down in the U.S. in the most recent read. It's also linked to the fact that our Kenvue brands are strong. We are typically number 1 and number 2 in our respective categories. We offer very strong value proposition at different price points for different types of consumers. And so we cater to different needs of different consumers through our portfolio. Now it's not something we take for granted. Every day, our teams are focused on making sure that we increase the relevancy of our brands with consumers, our credibility with health care professionals, to maintain our leadership position. Paul Ruh : Let me take the other part of your question. When we think about the impact of promotional spend to gross margin, we always look at all activation and investment with an eye to return on investment. So when we think about how we deploy our promotional spend, as well as for media, we look at how we can maximize the spend in investable propositions. So we do balance growth and profitability. In fact, we're very pleased with how our gross margin is evolving so far. I had mentioned the 290 basis points of gross margin expansion, that comes from both value realization and the excellent work that our supply chain team is doing across the board. And we expect this to continue in the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Thibaut, I wanted to ask about Our Vue Forward program. It seems like it was really just approved by the Board yesterday. So maybe you could give some perspective on just initial reactions internally across the organization and what steps you've taken to maybe help ensure that this is a program that's viewed as a program of acceleration that people can rally around versus maybe a potential source of disruption. And in that vein, if you could talk a little bit about where you see reinvestments to be prioritized as the savings are realized over the next couple of years, that would be great as well. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. So let me take the first part of your question, Steve and I'll have Paul answer the second one on the reinvestment. Our Vue Forward has always been a key element of our plan. We see the opportunity of exiting TSAs to not only clone the way of working we had as a division of J&J but as an opportunity to reinvent our ways of working to make Kenvue more competitive and a company focused on profitable growth. And that's what Our Vue Forward is all about. We are -- we have been thoughtful about putting together a comprehensive program that covers our global operations. As you said, our Board formally approved this work this week. And so today, we are sharing the details with you. We are -- everybody at Kenvue is mobilized to transform our company. That's something that we started doing from day 1 but we are clearly ramping up our efforts in this area as we enter our first full year as an independent company. And as I said, everybody understands that -- and is excited that the TSA exits is really an opportunity for us to reinvent our ways of working and become more nimble, more agile, closer to the consumer with better defined roles and responsibilities, having our teams co-located for better collaboration, innovation, creativity. And that's what we are all going after through this program. Paul Ruh : Yes. Let me provide some more details about how we're spending the $275 million both in '24 and '25. First, a large is going towards streamlining operations, mostly in our functions, where we are clarifying roles and responsibilities, we're simplifying processes, eliminating redundancies and the associated costs are primarily related to severance and footprint. A second large bucket is related to the upgrade of IT infrastructure that will allow us to be more competitive with our peers, allowing for faster and more informed decision-making. That is the second part of our investment. Ultimately, all of these investments position Kenvue to be much more agile at a lower cost of infrastructure and allowing us to be more competitive. I want to reiterate all of this has been contemplated in our guidance and it bolsters into delivering on our long-term algorithm on growing income faster than sales. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Just a quick clarification in terms of how you overdeliver, just wanted to make sure I understood exactly what the source of the upside was. And then, Thibaut just -- when you think about new leadership for Skin Health and Beauty, are there any specific characteristics you're looking for in terms of the new leadership? Just any perspective around that would be helpful. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Nik. And let me take the first one, what drove the outperformance in Q1. Remember, we guided to about flat and the outperformance was driven by price, a little bit by a little bit by volume as well. And from a regional perspective, Europe is doing very well, slightly ahead of our expectations and Essential Health from a segment perspective is also performing very well both in EMEA and LatAm. The rest is performing in our expectations. So pockets of strength across the portfolio as we execute against our priorities. I'll let you answer the second part of your question. Thibaut Mongon : On Skin Health, we have made the decision this quarter to relocate our segment leader position from Asia to the U.S. to work more closely with, again, in the spirit of being co-located with the majority of our teams and foster collaboration and creativity. As we look for a new leader for this segment, you will see a new leader coming in with an experience in the dynamic skin care category but also with experience in growing global megabrands because that's what you are talking about when you are talking about brands like Neutrogena, Aveeno and others that are megabrands present all over the world. So that's what you will see moving forward. Tina Romani : And then, Nik, maybe just to add on because it's an important point just in terms of Q1's outperformance. Paul talked through some of the unique dynamics. There's also unique dynamics in the second quarter that will absorb some of that. So overall for the first half, kind of in line with expectations in terms of performance. Thibaut Mongon : And for the full year, in line with our expectations as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anna Lizzul from Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : I just wanted to follow up on Bonnie's question. I wanted to ask how you plan to split some of the incremental investment in your brands, maybe between marketing and promotion. And how should we think about a potential increase of promotion or trade spend on price/mix as we move through the year? And then in Skin Health and Beauty, how much of the volume weakness was driven by Dr.Ci:Labo in China? Are you beginning to see a recovery there? And how should we think about the volume performance in Skin Health and Beauty by region this quarter? Paul Ruh : Thank you for the question, Anna. Let me take the first part and Thibaut will the second one. In terms of how we plan to spend our investments in our brands, remember, we always take a digital-first ROI-driven approach. We are on track to investing the $300 million more that we mentioned at our Q4 earnings. And we began Q1 with a focus on our 15 priority brands, considering what we call investable propositions and those are the ones where we maximize the return on investment. We are increasing investment across a spectrum of activities, from in-store activation to media, digital influencers and also HCP endorsement with a focus to amplify our innovation. Now the timing of the payback, you may ask, may vary. For example, in-store promotion has a more immediate but short-lived payback. And when we think about on the other extreme, HCP engagement is generally more of a long-term, more durable impact. But we're balancing all of those activities, focusing on the 15 priority brands and we're encouraged by what we are seeing in Q1. And we'll continue to deploy in the balance of the year to maximize reach and return on investment. Thibaut, let me pass on the second question to you. Thibaut Mongon : Sure. So your question on volume in China and Dr.Ci:Labo is a great question because it gives me the opportunity to talk about our China business. I feel that it's not always well understood. So China grew nicely last year and we saw China continuing to do very well in Q1, growing double digit. A couple of facts about our business in China. You may recall that China represents approximately 7% of our business. So it's not an overly developed market for us, ample opportunity for Kenvue to grow in that market. The other thing is that the majority of our business in China is in Self Care segment. We continue to see the categories growing as macro trends in China support growth, especially with a very ambitious Healthy China 2030 agenda by the China government. We see Chinese consumers continuing to be attracted to science-based efficacious solutions like ours. We are operating in China for many years with a very strong team. We are investing in our Self Care pipeline. Just a fun fact for you. Last year, we launched more innovation in China than we launched in the past 11 years combined in Self Care. And we have a very strong leadership position in that market across analgesics, pediatrics, allergy, antifungals. So when you hear me talking about our business in China, you see why we are pleased with the performance of our China -- the teams in China. Then there is a small part of our business that is not Self Care. That's where Dr.Ci:Labo and other brands are hosted. And here, as everybody else, we saw a deceleration of that part of business. We see the consumer being more cautious. As I indicated at the beginning of the year, we are not investing ahead of the curve in that part of the business. We have not assumed any recovery in the back half of our plan -- back half of the year in our plan and our outlook for the year. And -- but as I've always said, we are committed to the long-term prospect in China and that view has not changed. China is a positive contributor to our growth and we expect it to be the case again in 2024. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni from Citi. Filippo Falorni : Just a quick clarification. In the Q1 results, in the 1.9% organic, was there any impact from hyperinflation or repricing? Most of your peers have called it out. So I just wanted to check on that. And then a bigger question. You mentioned Q2, you expect low single-digit declines in Self Care. Maybe you can give some color for the other segment on expectations as well. And as you think about the second half, what gives you that confidence that volume will accelerate? Some of it is easy comps? Is it benefit from your investment action and investment in marketing advertising? Any more color there would be helpful. Paul Ruh : Yes. Thank you for the question, Filippo. Hyperinflation, particularly in both Argentina and in Turkey, represented about 90 basis points in Q1 with no impact to earnings. We are taking the appropriate pricing. That's why there's no impact to earnings. Hyperinflation is expected to have about 50% benefits for the top line for the full year as this 90 basis points in Q1 was particularly high given the compares versus last year. Do you want to take second one? Thibaut Mongon : I will take the second one about the unique dynamics of the Self Care segment in Q2. Filippo, there are a few dynamics for you to consider in Q2 as you think about Q2 for the Self Care segment specifically. One, we are going to have compares -- the difficult compares to absorb. We grew double digit in the second quarter last year. So that will be a strong compare. The second one is that we do not expect the same seasonal strength that we saw in China in the second quarter when China reopened. We expect continued impact of trade inventory reduction in -- by some customers in the U.S. And I told you that, so far, we saw a slow start to the allergy season which will weigh on volumes in Q2. Having said that, we -- you should also see it as non-operational elements masking the underlying in-market performance of our Self Care business. So that's what is driving our current thinking for Self Care in Q2. Regarding the back half of the year, we see no change in our expectations for the back half and that's why we reaffirm our guidance for 2024 this morning. It's going to be a combination of the easier compares, to your point but also seeing our plans taking hold as we execute our -- against our 2024 priorities. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer from Piper Sandler. Korinne Wolfmeyer : I'd like to touch a little bit more on the gross margin. It came in a little bit higher this quarter. I know you talked a little bit about some of the drivers there. Is there any way you can help us quantify the specific drivers and help us better understand which ones are going to be more sticky throughout the course of the year? And then any color on how to think about the cadence of the gross margin throughout the remainder of the year? Paul Ruh : Yes. Korinne, thank you for the question. We're actually very, very proud of the work that team is doing. Gross margin is a strong muscle for Kenvue. And pricing, that is value realization, continues to be a component our gross margin enhancement along with continuous efficiencies in our operations. The impact of inflation is also moderating with agrochemicals becoming now a tailwind and is still offset by some headwinds in labor and energy. And we're mindful of the unique dynamics and the volatility that we still see in the commodity markets. But we're very confident that we will be reaching, as I said in my prepared remarks, our stated goal of 59% by -- that we had back in 2021 this year. So we're more optimistic about the gross margin enhancement that will help fuel the brand activation and getting closer to our consumers and customers. As to what it means in terms of the cadence of the year, there's always a natural seasonality in our business. But I would -- it's fair to assume that our gross margins will be slightly better than we originally anticipated, that will continue to allow to fuel our investments in our brands. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Thibaut Mongon for closing remarks. Thibaut Mongon : So thank you all for participating on today's call and apologies again for the technical glitch at the beginning. As you can see, we are pleased with our solid start to the year. As we have discussed, we are committed to continue to transform our organization with our 3 clear strategic priorities : Reaching more consumers, freeing up resources to invest in our brands and fostering a culture of performance and impact at Kenvue. So our teams are all focused on executing with excellence and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Have a great day, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jim Giannakouros, Interim Head of Investor Relations for Kenvue. Jim Giannakouros : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Kenvue's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to be joined today by Thibaut Mongon, Kenvue\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Ruh, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's call includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our operating and financial performance, market opportunities and growth. These statements represent our current beliefs or expectations about future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially. For information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our earnings materials related to this call posted on our website and our filings with the SEC. During this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial information. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with US GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to their respected nearest US I measure can be found in this morning\u2019s press release and our presentation available on our IR website, investors.kenvue.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Jim. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. This quarter, we made good progress against our strategy. We drove year-over-year organic growth of 1.5% on top of 7.7% organic growth last year and increased adjusted gross profit margin by 410 basis points to 61.6%. This huge investment in our brands, while not impacting our ability to deliver EPS as per guidance. With our first and second quarter performance, we are on track to deliver our year as we continue to execute our new strategy as an independent company. Earlier this year, I committed to you that you would see a new Kenvue, the bolder company that is moving quickly to advance our three priorities to reach more consumers effectively, invest further behind our brands, and build a culture of performance and impact. Our first half results show the value of our pure-play model with a carefully curated portfolio covering a full spectrum of consumer health needs with iconic brands. While still early days, our results demonstrate that our transformation efforts are beginning to drive our internal impact. These efforts include our work to improve productivity and reduce cost. We expect to deliver approximately 150 basis points of adjusted gross profit margin expansion in 2024, higher than we anticipated coming into the year, as we drive greater value realization from favorable mix and stronger efficiencies in operations. In addition, we are actively reducing our cost structure through rigorous expense management and the on-track execution of our Vue Forward, our program to become a leaner, more agile, and fast-moving organization with a lower cost base. Our significant progress on productivity gives us more strategic flexibility. We have now chosen to invest approximately 20% more behind our brands this year than we did last year, advancing our priority to free up resources to invest more behind our brands to drive future growth. We are targeting our investment toward high-yield strategies such as healthcare professional engagement, install prominence, and direct consumer engagement with an increasing focus on innovation and influences. This both strengthens loyalty among our existing consumers and expands our reach to new consumers. And we are beginning to see the impact on our brands across our portfolio. Core to our transformation is the culture we are building. We are driving a heightened sense of accountability across the organization that is shooting speed in execution to drive profitable growth. In summary, halfway through our first full year as an independent company, we are on track to deliver our financial goals for 2024. In addition, while we would expect to continue to operate in a volatile environment, our progress to date and our plans for the back half bolster our confidence to deliver on our long-term value creation algorithm targeting attractive total shareholder return in 2025 and beyond. Now looking at the key highlights of our performance this quarter. We have started to see the early impact of our work on our three priorities. After a slow start in allergy and sun earlier in the quarter, we saw a positive shift in US consumption in the months of June. This immediately translated to shipments due to the strength of our brands being top of mind for consumers and our ability to replenish low levels of retail inventory with agility. In Self Care, organic growth was essentially flat year-over-year on top of 14.2% growth last year, which beat our internal expectations. Once again, we outperform the market globally this quarter, having no maintain or grown share every quarter for the last two years. Tylenol, the number one brand in pain relief globally, delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of shared growth in the U.S., further widening the gap versus our closest competitor in both value and volume. Our consumer-centric innovations, including Tylenol Easy to Swallow, designed for those who hesitate to take a pill, benefited from our increased investments to reach more healthcare professionals and consumers, and expanded in-store presence and prominence. In Allergy, sales accelerated in June after a slow start to the spring season in the U.S. Kenvue is now the number one and fastest-growing manufacturer in the Allergy category in the U.S., with our brands Zyrtec and Benadryl gaining share in value and volume. This growth has been driven in part by our expanded in-store presence and increased media to amplify innovation like Zyrtec overall Dissolved Tablets. Essential Health continued to perform well, with broad-based organic growth of 7.6% in the quarter, on top of 3.8% in the same period last year, and balanced growth between value realization and volume. Notably, Listerine grew approximately 10% globally. Listerine is another good example of how increased investment in the right areas drives returns. While the brand has historically been powered by our number one recommendation with dentist and strong clinical superiority, we are strengthening marketing span to create higher visibility with consumers through digital media, influencers, and in-store prominence, driving new consumers to the category. We are also amplifying high-performing innovation, including Listerine Clinical Solutions, our new premium line in which each product is tailored to specific all health needs. As a result, Clinical Solutions is the number one mouthwash line innovation in the US today. Our Skin Health and Beauty segment performed in line with our expectations in this first phase of our recovery plan. Organic growth declined 2.4% year-over-year, following plus 3.4% organic growth in the second quarter last year. This is an improvement sequentially, and while this is a journey, we are on track to stabilize the business. Europe continues to perform well with the successful expansion of Aveeno and Neutrogena in the UK, Germany, and Southern Europe. The teams are executing with excellence in-store with a significant increase in shell presence through compelling brand blocks. In China, the category continues to be soft and evolving consumer preferences are proving to be challenging for Dr.Ci:Labo Brand, contributing to the impairment of assets we described in our press release. In the US, which is our priority, we continue to activate our plans to stabilize the business this year with expectations to resume consumption growth next year. As we shared with you previously, we are working diligently to improve our in -store presence and prominence, increasing the number of our displays to augment growth. We activated our strategies this sun season, and as a result, Neutrogena confirmed its number one position and gained share in the seasonal segment with our ultra share and biz defense lines. We are also elevating healthcare professional and consumer engagement. We have doubled the size of our detailing sales force and significantly increased our sampling efforts with dermatologists, already resulting in an increased share of dermatologist recommendations. And on social media, Neutrogena is making a strong pivot to reach Gen Z consumers through influencers, partnering with Alex Pearl, our gold medalist, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone to launch engaging content on social media. I hope you will join us in sharing for Sydney during the 400-meter hurdle this week. And we are amplifying innovation as well. For example, we are launching Neutrogena Collagen Bank in the US, a brand new pre-aging platform with a patented peptide technology developed with dermatologists to penetrate more than 10 layers deep within your skin. This innovation receives 100% acceptance by your top retailers. To build demand before products arrive in-store, Collagen Bank first launched on TikTok Shop, the first for Neutrogena. This approach generated tremendous buzz online and motivated one of our major customers to pull forward their retail launch. So while we are in the early days of our journey, we are focused on executing our plan with precision, strengthened capabilities, and increased investment across our portfolio. A few final remarks on other areas where we are making progress as an independent company before I hand it over to Paul. First, I hope you all had a chance to read our inaugural Healthy Lives Mission report, which we published in June. The report outlines our ESG strategy, goals, and progress, and there is a lot we are proud of in year one. You may also have seen last week that we announced the implementation of a board succession process following the sale of J&J's stake earlier this year. The appointments of Kathleen Pawlus and Kirk Perry as two new Independent Directors coincide with Joe Wolk and Peter Fasolo stepping down by the end of this year. I would like to express my deep gratitude for Joe and Peter's contributions to Kenvue as we executed a successful transition to become an Independent Company and welcome Kathy and Kirk whose deep experience, expertise, and capabilities will be valuable additions to the board. Additionally, as an Independent Company with a deep commitment to shareholder value creation, we were pleased to announce earlier in July the board's declaration of first dividend increase. This is a testament to our strong balance sheet and cash-generating capabilities which will only improve as we continue our journey at Kenvue. All our efforts will not be possible without the performance of our people. I would like to thank Kenvuers around the world for leading our new culture and for their commitment to driving results this quarter again, demonstrating the power of Kenvue in action. With that, I will turn it over to Paul. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our Q2 performance came in ahead of our mid-quarter expectations, with strong sales in June and greater benefits from productivity and mix, generating higher-than-expected gross profit margin expansion. As a result, we have made the strategic decision to further increase our marketing spend. This strengthens Kenvue positions to deliver our long-term value creation algorithm and does not impact our ability to deliver our EPS guidance for 2024. Moving into more details, second quarter organic growth was 1.5%, primarily driven by value realization across all segments and volume growth in Essential Health, partially offset by low single digit volume declines in both Self Care and Skin Health and Beauty. Value realization contributed 2.1% to growth, benefiting mostly from carryover and incremental pricing actions. While we expect volume to increasingly contribute to sales growth from here, value realization will continue to be an important part of our value creation algorithm. Volume was down 0.6% year-over-year, with sequential improvement during the quarter on the back of greater Essential Health performance, continued overall share gains in Self Care, and steady progression towards stabilizing Skin Health and Beauty. Now let's take a look at our segments. Self Care organic growth was essentially flat on top of mid-teens growth last year, with continued share gains across the segment. Value realization contributed 1.1% to growth in the quarter driven by both carryover and incremental pricing actions. This was offset by volume down 1.3% due to a shorter cough, cold, and flu season versus last year. We entered the second quarter of 2024, experiencing a slow start to the allergy season and observing a continuation of tight inventory controls in retail through May. However, demand for allergy accelerated in June and we activated our Zyrtec and Benadryl brand successfully and gained share. Smoking cessation also had a strong quarter overall. So, as you heard from Thibaut, the segment continues to do very well, outgrowing the market and strengthening our leadership positions. Moving to Skin Health and Beauty. Organic growth decreased 2.4% with 3.9% of volume decline, partially offset by 1.5% of positive value realization driven by mix and carryover pricing. In the first phase of our recovery plan, we see signs of improvement as Skin Health and Beauty second quarter year-over-year volume trend sequentially improved 300 basis points from the first quarter. For Essential Health, the segment had strong organic growth of 7.6% with 4.1% of value realization and 3.5% of volume growth. Carryover pricing primarily in North America and to a lesser extent new pricing outside the US drove value realization. Essential Health grew across all categories and all geographic regions. An effective combination of relevant innovation and increased marketing drove the volume gains. Moving to adjusted gross profit margins. In the quarter, adjusted gross profit margin improved 410 basis points largely driven by supply chain efficiency gains, which includes favorable commodity costs, and also value realization. Given our performance to date, we now expect full year 2024 gross margin to be closer to 60% or expand approximately 150 basis points versus last year. We are encouraged by the pace of improvements made by our supply chain and revenue growth management teams. The same teams are creating the building blocks to deliver continued gross margin expansion over the next several years. For modeling purposes, adjusted gross profit margin is typically highest in Q2 and declines in the back half with Q4 being the lowest due to annual plant maintenance. This year, lower value realization and progressively lower commodity inflation benefits are expected to accentuate this trend. Now on to adjusted operating income margin, which was 22.8% in the second quarter. A strong delivery of gross margin expansion, benefits of cost controls, as well as our confidence in the strength of our back half plans, enable us to further increase our brand investments by up to %100 million this year. These advances are priority to further invest behind our brands, getting us closer to competitive levels without compromising our ability to deliver on EPS. As a reminder, this increased investment will be reflected in our advertising, consumer and product promotion and healthcare professional spend. With regards to modeling the back half, we anticipate the combination of lower gross margins and increased spend will result in operating margin being down sequentially versus the high watermark set in the second quarter. And for the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 21% to 22% with no impact to our EPS delivery. We believe this is the right time to accelerate these investments, building on the momentum we are seeing to bolster our ability to deliver on our long-term algorithm. To close out the P&L, interest expense net for the quarter was $92 million. Given our year-to-date net interest expense, we now expect it to be in the range of $380 million to $400 million for the full year 2024. For taxes, the second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.7%. Regarding other income and expenses, in the quarter we incurred a noncash after-tax charge of $337 million to adjust the carrying value of long-lived assets related to the Dr.Ci:Labo business. The impairment was a result of updates in a strategy to reach more consumers and appropriately address evolving market dynamics, including shifts in consumer sentiment in China as well as changing shopping patterns in the region. We continue to believe in the strengths of the brand and are actively investing in its long-term opportunities. And finally, adjusted net income was $611 million for the quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.32. Moving to capital allocation, the quarter reflects our balanced approach. Our first priority is investing in the business both in our brands and in our operations with our Vue Forward. As a reminder, our Vue Forward includes a multi-year program of rebalancing our resources to improve our agility and speed, better positioning us for the future with a more efficient cost base. Our initiatives are tracking on plan with associated spending tracking to approximately $275 million this year and we plan to maintain similar spending levels for 2025. By 2026, we expect to have generated $350 million in savings or better stated, resources reallocated to future growth investment. In addition, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders. In July, we announced our first increase in our dividend as a public company and intend to continue to deliver attractive dividends to our shareholders over the long run. Now, to summarize our expectations for 2024, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver within the sales and EPS outlook ranges set at the beginning of the year. This includes organic growth expectations in the 2% to 4% range and adjusted EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. For the full year, we expect foreign exchange to be a 1% headwind, also unchanged from prior guidance. Thank you. And with that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Anna Lizzul : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the new pricing actions that you mentioned in terms of the depth and the categories in which you took pricing. And then on volumes, the declines improved sequentially and can help this quarter. I was wondering if you could give us more detail on your expectations for the back half and how the innovation pipeline is shaping up here. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, good morning. Anna and thank you for your question. Regarding your first question on value realization, it's really the combination of carryover pricing, new pricing as you stated and a mix. Regarding new price actions, remember that our philosophy at Kenvue is to offset inflation and FX conditions with pricing. So typically we take these price actions in markets and categories where we still see inflation and FX impact. We expect value realization to continue to be part of our value creation algorithm, but as the year continues you will see less and less impact of carryover pricing and you will see more impact of mix and new pricing actions. In terms of your question on the sequential improvement in volume for our Skin Health segment, we are pleased with the early signs of impact of the recovery plan we have put in place since the beginning of the year. I'm encouraged with these early signs. As you said, we see a sequential improvement from Q1 in terms of year-over-year trends. We are reaching more consumers and HCPs successfully. We saw an increase in household penetration for Neutrogena in the US, particularly with millennials and Hispanics, which is encouraging and we have strong building blocks for the back half. So we are executing a thoughtful plan. This will be a journey, but I'm encouraged with what we have seen so far. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the 20% aggregate increase in spending behind your brands that you called out this year. I'm curious as to how much of that has already been deployed versus is something that you're targeting to come in the second half. And then I guess as you contemplate that 20% increase, where does that bring you relative to what you view as kind of the optimized level of aggregate brand support? It sounds like from Vue Forward contemplation, we should expect more investment in the years to come. But I guess I'm curious as to where you think you are today relative to what is ultimately optimal. Thank you. Paul Ruh : Thanks, Steve. Let me take the first part of your question, which is about the 20% marketing spend. We started the year with a 15% year-over-year increase. Remember it was $300 million that we talked about as we have seen the acceleration of initiatives take hold and we have seen the benefits of gross margin enhancement. Now we feel more confident in investing 20% more instead of 15% more. So we added another $100 million that we are starting to deploy as of Q2 and going forward. We believe that this is a step in the right direction and as we continue to see efficiencies in our gross profit margin and we continue to see the benefits of our Vue Forward program, we will continue to invest more. That will not only happen in 2024, but we are preparing the building blocks along those lines into 2025 and beyond. Thibaut, if you want to comment where are we going and how far? Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Steve, as you can tell, we are getting closer to industry standard faster than we anticipated. Having said that, as you heard from Paul, we will continue to invest. One of the realities of the consumer health space is that we are talking about categories that are underpenetrated and where we have many opportunities to expand usage occasions. So as long as we see opportunities to do that, we will raise our investment level. We have many consumers talk to and to recruit into our portfolio with our innovation for many years to come. Having said that, we continue to do that with discipline, always with an eye on strong return on investment, but as long as we see strong returns on our investment, we will continue to free up resources to invest behind our brands and reach more consumers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning to all and thank you for the question. Thibaut, you mentioned that the Skin Health and Beauty division delivered according to expectations and is on track for the plan in the year. Would that imply a positive inflection in organic sales growth? I mean, more specifically, I know to a previous question, you were very positive about that support and the innovation that is coming online, but I think investors wanted to see some sort of reassuring into the second half. Understandably, you have much easier comps and good setups on, as you mentioned before, a lot of salesforce improvement there as well. Then related to the comments about the retail destocking and thinking about Self Care as well, is there any update on that? In particular, I understand it's mostly into the US, but if you can, given that your business is a lot of international, we are focusing a lot in the US right now, but you have half of your business outside the US, so wondering if you can comment on how you're seeing Europe, how you're seeing Asia, and across the board in Self Care. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, let me start with the second one very quickly. Andrea, we saw some destocking happening in the US in the first half. We mentioned at the beginning of the year that it impacted Q1. It would continue to impact Q2. That's what happened, and we've seen these levels stabilizing and we don't expect further impact in the back half of the year as we communicated earlier in the year. Outside of the US, we see healthy levels of inventory and don't expect any major movement in that area. On your question on Skin Health and Beauty, it's really the early stage in our recovery plan in the US. As I said, I'm encouraged with what I see. I see that our US team is executing with precision the plan that they outlined at the beginning of the year. We are on track to stabilize the business in 2024. We see volumes continue to improve sequentially as we get into the back half of the year. As we continue to increase our presence and our prominence in store with more displays, I give you the example of the sun season, you will see similar activities in the back half. But also how we reach and engage with dermatologists and consumers in a bigger way, amplifying innovation, especially on social media with influencers. We will continue to execute this plan. It will not happen overnight, but we will see sequential improvement as a year unfolds. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess two questions on the beauty business, Skin Health and Beauty business. Maybe we can get an update on leadership, any progress there. And then the second question is just, I'm hearing a lot of tactical, initiatives in terms of, improving the business, more spending, more displays. Thibaut, I was hoping you could maybe talk about, the brands themselves, in terms of the architecture of the brand, SKU rationalization, that needs to happen to kind of streamline and kind of make it less of a confusing lineup. Any perspective around that would be helpful. Just kind of understand kind of the core dynamics that you need to do to really get this business to turn around. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Nick, great question. So on the leadership, we are making progress to fill the segment leadership position, so we will inform you when we are ready to do so. In the meantime, things are happening fast and furious. In Kenvue, our Chief Growth Officer, Charmaine England, is leading the segment in interim and making great progress there. I talked about how the US team is focused on execution, the same thing outside the US. So the entire team around the world is mobilized to execute risk precision against our three priorities, and that includes Skin Health and Beauty, and you start seeing the impact of their work. Now, talking about your second question on our brands, our focus is on making sure that our brands are more relevant every day and reach more consumers in multiple ways, and that's why we are so focused on executing risk precision, making sure that we reach more consumers with social media influencers. We reach more dermatologists, so they can recommend the brand more. Through these activities, we are not only reaching more consumers, but we are more relevant. This is also the case with innovation. Innovation is, every time we launch a new product, and Collagen Bank is a good example, it's an opportunity for a brand like Neutrogena to advance its relevance with our target audience and demonstrate our superiority. So our brands are strong, highly penetrated. I talked about the improvement we have seen in the first half in household penetration for Neutrogena in the US, which is great. We are focused on improving the relevance of our brands and innovation plays a big role there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking a question. So I wanted to ask about the Essential Health business. It's been an area of strength in your portfolio. Maybe what drove the strength in the quarter, a bigger improvement in volume growth compared to Q1? Maybe you can elaborate on that and some of the expectations into the second half for Essential Health. And then a second question, I have a quick follow-up on the Skin Health and Beauty business. Maybe you can comment about the China portion of the business, what you saw in the quarter, what your expectations in the second half. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Okay, Filippo, good morning. So let me start with your question on Essential Health. We are pleased with the performance of the Essential Health segment. Strong quarter two, strong first half, broad-based growth across every region and every category on top of growth last year. Also, the balance growth between value and volume. We talked about the very strong performance of Listerine, growing double-digit when you see that this brand is a global brand, more than five times bigger than our next competitor. It's a very strong showing, but we have similar momentum going on across the segments with strong innovation. We launched BAND-AID Pro Heal in the US, which is up to a good start. We talked last quarter about having Aveeno kids in the US, which is our expansion from babies into kids to grow the category. This continues to do extremely well. We are also doing very well with our premium state-free napkins in India. So really the theme for us across Essential Health is to expand the categories, bring new users to the categories given the very strong leadership positions we have in each of the categories in which we compete. And that's what you see happening across the portfolio this quarter and the first half. Longer term, that's what we intend to continue to do. Driving category growth, we have a lot of room to grow in these directions, and bringing new users in the category with solutions that help them take better care of their health. And that's what we intend to do moving forward. On the second question regarding China, China is a positive contributor to our growth in Q2 and we expect it to continue to be the case in 2024. Remember that the majority of our business in China is in Self Care with very strong position in energy, energetics, antifungals, pediatrics, and we continue to see Chinese consumers looking for science-based efficacious solutions in the self care space and we are extremely well positioned to respond to this increasing demand. So we remain committed to the China market from this perspective and we expect China to continue to be a positive contributor to our growth. Then we have a small part of our business that is in the other segments and here as everybody else we see in the skin health part that you mentioned a soft category the consumer is more cautious. You have evolving consumer preferences and that's an area where we are more cautious in our investment. Having said that, it's an area where we see the beauty of our model and the strength of our portfolio. While we see Dr.Ci:Labo, a brand of Japanese origin, being negatively impacted this year, we see a very strong demand and very strong growth for our local Chinese brand called Dabao. That's where you see the beauty of the portfolio where multiple brands allow us to cater to the different needs of different consumers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Susan Anderson : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if maybe you could give some more color just on the promotional environment particularly in the U.S. I think both Walmart and Target have talked about lowering prices. I know the drugstore channel has been tough so I'm just curious if you're really seeing across all of your categories and then also how much have you put into the gross margin for the back half of the year. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Okay, I'll start with telling you a little bit about what we see with consumer and then I will let Paul answer your question on the gross margin in the back half of the year. So when we look at the consumers in the U.S. and frankly around the world, we see that consumers continue to be thoughtful and choiceful on where they make trade-offs. One area where they are not making trade-offs is their health and the health of their loved ones. They are, we see consumers, I would say, increasingly prioritizing their health and the health of their family. We have in our portfolio different price points and different brands to meet them where they are and carry out to the different needs of different consumers but we see that in consumer health, consumers are willing to pay a premium for brands that are science-backed, recommended by their doctors and brought to them by a brand they trust and that's what Kenvue is all about. So in my prepared remark, I talked about Tylenol Easy to Swallow, or Listerine Clinical Solutions. I just talked about BAND-AID Pro Heal. These are all premium solutions that are 10%, 15%, 20% more expensive than the base offering and they are extremely well received by consumers. Why? Because they bring an efficacious solution to real need for consumers. We are not in the impulse buying categories at Kenvue. We are providing efficacious solutions to respond to the needs of our consumers. Another data point that I would give you is that we don't see a change in the penetration of private level in our categories in the US and around the world. If I take the US Self Care category, which is probably one of the most penetrated categories we have in terms of private level, the private level penetration is down so far this year. So we don't see in our categories and at Kenvue what you see in other categories. Having said that, we don't take it for granted and our teams work very hard every day to make sure that we understand our consumers, are close to our consumers and bring them the data, the solutions, the products, the brands they trust and the need to take care of their health. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut. Let me talk about a couple of things. Promotional intensity, promotional environment in the US and the potential impact that has on the gross margins. So promotional intensity for us promoting promotion is more part of our strategy and it's a way to provide more visibility and prominence in store for our products. It's not necessarily about products discounting and I can tell you that in 2024 we have not seen us increase promotional intensity or a portion of volume or sales sold on deal above the RPO set. So we are very judicious about how we manage our promotional intensity. It's an ROI based approach and we continue to do that. So when it comes to a gross profit margin, let me step back and tell you about our Q2 performance. We're pleased with our Q2 performance. It was driven by value realization, mix supply chain efficiencies and it's typically, Q2 is typically the highest GP quarter due to seasonal builds and also the mix that we have. If I look at the balance of the year, it will go down from the high watermark of Q2 and Q4 is expected to be the lowest as I mentioned in my prepared remarks due to factory and plant maintenance with Q3 being about in line with Q1. We're also seeing commodity pricing hedging up although it's still deflationary but we're continuing to work on productivity and continue to advance our productivity enhancements. As we look at gross margin going forward, we look at it holistically, value realization, efficiencies, et cetera, and we're preparing building blocks for 2024 and 2025 and beyond. So that's how I look at it, and promotions are something we consider, but it's a holistic analysis on how we drive our gross profit margins going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Fialko with HSBC. Jeremy Fialko : Hi, there. Thanks for taking the questions, a couple from me. First one is just a follow-up on the previous question. We've heard a number of peers talk about a slowdown in U.S. skin care, particularly on the dermatological side, so I wanted to hear whether that is something that you are seeing and where the slowdown that they refer to is happening. And then secondly, just a bit of a follow-up on the seasonal businesses, talk about sun care, the trends they are seeing through Q3, and then the sort of setup for the cold and flu season. My assumption is that you've now got a pretty normal course, i.e. normal inventories, a normal basis comparison, and therefore we should expect to see some sort of year-on-year growth in line with the historic averages, but again, your perspective on that would be very helpful. Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Jeremy, so your first question on what we see in the Skin Health category, we see units about flat in Q2, I would say. You have differences between body, sun, hair and face. Within face, we see some softness recently in moisturizers, but offset by growth in acne as an example. So I would say that from a Kenvue point of view, we are focused on executing the plan I highlighted, and we don't see category dynamics impacting the precision in the execution of our plan moving forward. If you think about the back half of the year, I'm not going to start reporting on Q3, but I would say that, sun, we saw a positive shift in consumption in June, and basically the season is almost is basically done by the end of the second quarter in terms of shipments for us and I would not expect replenishment happening in Q3. For the upcoming cough, cold and flu season that's in front of us, as we said at the beginning of the year, we are planning for normal season this year. What we are seeing is more in terms of phasing of shipments between Q3 and Q4. What we see is retailers reverting to their historical ordering pattern of ordering what they need more in Q4 than in Q3. So last year when we were still recovering from the pre-pandemic in \u201822 and there were questions on supply chain resiliency around the world, we saw some retailers anticipating their purchase in Q3. This year we don't see that happening. We see retailers reverting to their historical ordering pattern capitalizing on the fact that supply chain is more resilient and that certainly is the case with Kenvue. But as always, we will be ready to respond to the demand regardless of the season. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks operator and good morning, everyone. I hope you are doing well. Maybe just to start a bit more of a housekeeping. I think you mentioned in response to Andrea's question that you expect sequential improvement in volume performance in the back half of the year for Skin Health and Beauty. Do you anticipate returning to growth at some point in the backup year? Just trying to make sure we think about the trajectory correctly, just giving all the moving pieces. Thibaut Mongon : Peter, yes, good morning, and thanks for the question. So we see sequential improvement in volume in the second half. It will turn to positive. We expect it to happen more towards the fourth quarter, both in terms of volume and also growth. Also keep in mind the comps versus last year. So Q4 will certainly see a positive showing in Skin Health and Beauty. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Thibaut Mongon for concluding comments. Thibaut Mongon : All right. Thank you all for all your questions this morning. And I would just end by repeating right that earlier this year, I committed to you that you would see a new Kenvue in action this year, one that the company that is moving quickly to advance our three priorities to reach more consumers effectively, invest better behind our brands and build a culture of growth and impact. And while we are still in the early stages of implementing our strategies, we are confident that we are on the right path to deliver on our near-term targets, but as importantly setting up Kenvue to deliver on our long-term value creation algorithm. So with that, I wish you all a great day. Thank you for joining us on the call and thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Sofya Tsinis, Head of Investor Relations for Kenvue. Sofya Tsinis : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be joined today by Thibaut Mongon, Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Ruh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's call includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our operating and financial performance, market opportunities and growth. These statements represent our current beliefs, expectations or assumptions about future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and changes that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially. For information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our earnings materials related to this call posted on our website and our filings with the SEC. During this call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial information. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in conjunction with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and are not presented as substitutes for or superior to those most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

With that, I'll pass the call over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, everyone for joining us today. First, I'd like to welcome Sofya Tsinis of our Head of Investor Relations. Many of you know Sofya. She brings over 20 years of experience and expertise in both Investor Relations and Equity Research in the consumer product sector, and we are pleased she is now part of the Kenvue team. In the third quarter, we delivered year-over-year organic growth of 0.9% on top of 3.6% last year. Despite the softer top-line that we are actively addressing, we delivered another quarter of strong productivity and efficiencies, funded our investments in our brands, and generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28. Throughout the organization, we are fundamentally and rapidly transforming our ways of working to unleash our full potential and fulfill our commitments to create long-term shareholder value. Leveraging our entire portfolio of iconic and trusted brands, we are activating our new Kenvue playbook to strengthen our presence and prominence in store, reach more consumers directly and through healthcare professionals, and amplify our innovation in a more impactful way. Self Care and Essential Health are already benefiting from this new way of working. In Skin Health and Beauty, while we are not yet where we want to be, we are advancing these focus areas to improve our growth trajectory and I will get into more details about the early results we started seeing in a minute. This playbook is powered by the increased marketing investment we discussed with you earlier this year. For 2024, we are on track to invest approximately 20% more than we did last year through advertising, healthcare professional engagement, in-store prominence and direct consumer engagement with an increasing focus on social media marketing powered by analytics and AI. Not only are we investing more, but we are also improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing spend. For example, we announced in August, the creation of our new Global Content Factory, the production agency ecosystem we will leverage to drive relevant content in each market while reducing our costs. We are funding these marketing investments by driving productivity and efficiencies in our business. In Q3, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted gross margin expansion of 130 basis points versus last year. In addition, as we rapidly transform our organization, we are also starting to see a decline in non-marketing related operating expenses. We have now exited nearly three quarters of our TSAs and remain on track to fully exit these agreements by mid-2025. As we unwind these TSAs, our teams continue to find better, simpler, and more cost effective ways to operate as an independent company. We are also on track to deliver $350 million in annual savings by 2026, through the Our Vue Forward initiative, as we continue to modernize our systems and optimize our organization. Combining these two programs, we are making rapid progress in becoming a leaner, more agile and fast moving consumer health organization with a more efficient cost structure, which in turn allows us to invest in our brands at more competitive levels, build new capabilities, and deliver on our income commitments. Now looking at the key highlights of our performance this quarter. Around the world, we see that consumers continue to prioritize taking control of their own health and are looking for convenience and value. In Self Care, our largest segment, organic sales grew 0.7% in the third quarter in line with our expectations as we lapped a strong year ago comparison of 6.7% growth. In a quarter where we saw volumes impacted by continued low incidence of allergy and pediatric fever, Self Care once again outperformed the market. In the U.S., we continue to strengthen our number one positions in pain and allergy with both Tylenol and Zyrtec once again growing share in both value and volume this quarter. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of share gain for Tylenol and the 13th consecutive quarter of share gain for Zyrtec. We are rapidly expanding distribution of our recently launched Tylenol Easy To Swallow across key retailers and amplifying this innovation with increased advertising spend and an impactful omni-channel approach with our Greatness Hurts campaign. As a result, Tylenol Easy To Swallow is already the number one performing innovation in adult internal analgesics across the U.S. and is bringing new consumers to the brand. Outside the U.S., our Self Care portfolio continues to gain share as well. For example, we continue to win with Nicorette. In the UK, we drove mid-teens growth in Nicorette QuickMist as a first and only nicotine replacement therapy marketed to aid both smoking and vaping cessation. In addition, we are building on this momentum with the relaunch of Nicorette Lozenge with a new claim of fighting cravings in just two minutes. With this multipronged approach, we are not only strengthening our global leadership position in smoking cessation, but are also expanding the category to vaping cessation. Essential Health continued to perform well driving volume growth for the second quarter in a row. We delivered organic growth of 4.5% in the third quarter on top of 3.8% last year with broad-based growth across all categories and all regions. Here as well, we are advancing our priorities to drive sustained growth. For example in oral care, this was another strong quarter for Listerine with high-single-digit growth globally. We are driving this growth by expanding distribution of our top retail partners and enhancing our in-store prominence with impactful displays, especially with our latest innovations like Listerine Clinical Solutions in the U.S. In addition, we are reaching more consumers, increasing our media spend and partnering with digital creators to generate engaging content on social media that highlights the superiority of Listerine in a consumer relevant way. Similarly, we see the positive impact of our new ways of working with Band-Aid in the U.S. where we drove mid-single-digit growth behind the success of our latest innovation Band-Aid Pro Heal. This repair product has been clinically tested to improve wound healing by 60% and here as well we expanded distribution of our top retail partners, increased media presence with the return of the iconic Band-Aid Jingle and have generated strong traction to-date with Band-Aid Pro Heal accounting for more than one-third of the brand's growth. In Skin Health and Beauty, organic sales for the segments declined 2.7% year-over-year. In the U.S., our playbook is not yet delivering the results we want to see and the pace of recovery was hindered this quarter by a muted sun season and decelerating skincare category dynamics. In China, the consumer backdrop, as many of you know remains challenging. While addressing these headwinds is short-term, we are also moving at pace to strengthen our underlying skincare expertise by building a world class team and by partnering with the best leaders in the industry, two key enablers to improve and sustain higher performance in this segment. This week, we welcomed Andrew Stanleick to Kenvue as our new Head of Skin Health and Beauty for North America and Europe. Andrew is a seasoned and accomplished leader with partnerships with highly influential leaders in skincare. Last week, we announced a breakthrough collaboration between Neutrogena and two of the world's most recognizable dermatologists, Dr. Bhanusali, a renowned skincare innovator and Dr. Shah, the most followed dermatologist educator worldwide with over 20 million social media followers across key social channels and over 550 million likes on TikTok. The objective of this multi-year partnership is to strengthen the brand's innovation and create more engaging and authentic communication while expanding and accelerating our dermatologist engagement. These are two foundational steps in the right direction for the segment with more to come in the future. Europe continued to deliver strong performance during the third quarter, growing double-digits and demonstrating the power of our playbook in this segment. Sales growth was balanced between volume growth and value realization driven by new product launches, solid brand activation plans and distribution expansion. For example, we rapidly increased our in-store presence with the deployment of nearly 5,000 Neutrogena brand blocks across pharmacies in France and Spain and we significantly amplified our reached consumers with an enhanced influencer strategy in these countries. And in the UK, Aveeno became one of the fastest growing face care brands with strong in-store execution and a viral campaign with celebrity Molly-Mae Hague. In the U.S., we did not see the overall sequential volume improvements that we were expecting with revenue for the segment declining year-over-year. However, we are encouraged by early signs of sequential recovery in the areas that we have prioritized thus far. For example, in Neutrogena, we have put concerted efforts behind strengthening in-store performance for our two largest platforms face and sun, which account for about 80% of the brand sales in the U.S. And we are starting to see initial progress in brick-and-mortar track channels, in face while still down year-over-year; Neutrogena gained 40 basis points of share sequentially since the new face care planograms were put in place mid-way through the quarter. And in September, Neutrogena regained its position as the number one face care brand in these channels. In sun, despite the muted season, we strengthened our number one leadership position and outperformed the market this quarter, as Neutrogena gained 20 basis points of share in the same channels. We see these improvements as early evidence that our Kenvue playbook is starting to generate results in Neutrogena. In distribution, while we see further opportunities for improvement, we are making progress. [Indiscernible] are now complete for this year with Neutrogena benefiting from increased point of distribution at some retailers, improved shelving and navigation at others, and broad distribution for our latest innovations Collagen Bank, acne patch for sensitive skin and our new Ultra Gentle cleansers. In addition, we have doubled our professional sales force and are now reaching significantly more dermatologists and it is working. Neutrogena has now reached its highest level of average recommendations by dermatologists for face care in the last four years. This is an investment for the long-term and a strong sign of future revenue potential. Importantly, we are reaching more consumers with our increased marketing investments and continued pivot to social platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. For example, we are supporting our Collagen Bank innovation through an impactful campaign targeting Gen Z consumers with celebrity highly time trails. This social first activation has generated more than 800 million video views to-date. These actions are starting to drive sequential share gains in the pockets of our Neutrogena business that we have prioritized thus far. But let me be clear, this is still work in progress and our teams are working diligently on both amplifying these Neutrogena green shoots and building the same momentum across the balance of our Skin Health and Beauty business. As I've said all along, the recovery of our U.S. Skin Health business will not happen overnight and will not be linear. But we continue to work to make fundamental changes to this business with new talent, new partnerships, and a relentless focus on executing our new playbook with precision. At the beginning of the year, I told you that you would see a new Kenvue in action as we transform from a division of a large organization to being an independent, pure-play global leader in consumer health. Our transformation is well on its way and we already started seeing improvements in part of the P&L, but we are not yet seeing the full impact in our top-line. Our 2024 growth rate is tracking towards the low end of the range we shared with you at the beginning of the year due to both the pace of a recovery in Skin Health and Beauty and softer category dynamics in the back half of the year in both Self Care and Skin Health and Beauty. At the same time, we are ahead on our productivity initiatives, which in combination with our cost savings programs are fueling an acceleration in brand investment for future growth, while still enabling us to deliver within our adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook for the year. In parallel, we are making sure we are building the right foundation for sustainable performance. We are advancing our healthy lives mission. You may have seen our improved MSCI score from BBB to AA. Also encouraged to see that every day, our teams around the world demonstrate their unwavering commitment to transform our company and advance our key priorities of reaching more consumers, investing more behind our brands, and building a culture of performance and impact. This makes us confident that we are on our way to generate sustainable and profitable growth and drive strong value creation over time. With that, I will turn it over to Paul. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter organic growth was 0.9% driven by value realization across all segments and volume growth in Essential Health for the second quarter in a row. Overall volumes declined 1.6% year-over-year, driven by Self Care and Skin Health and Beauty. Value realization contributed 2.5% to organic growth with balanced contribution from carryover benefits and incremental value realization actions taken this year. While we expect both price and mix to continue to contribute to growth, we expect volumes will play a bigger role in our growth algorithm going forward. Taking a closer look at our segments, Self Care organic growth was 0.7% year-over-year in line with our expectations as we drove continued share gains across the segment with particular strength in pain and allergy. Value realization contributed 1.8% of growth driven by carryover benefits and incremental pricing actions taken this year. This was partially offset by a volume decline of 1.1%, primarily due to softer incidences in allergy and pediatric fever, as well as some retailers reverting to historical order patterns in cold, cough, and flu instead of stocking up ahead of the season. Smoking cessation once again had a strong quarter overall. Moving to Essential Health, once again, Essential Health grew across all categories and all geographic regions, generating organic growth of 4.5% in line with our expectations. Value realization was 3.7%, driven mostly by carryover pricing, selective price increases outside the U.S. and mixed benefits from innovation such as Listerine Clinical Solutions. For the second consecutive quarter, volume grew year-over-year coming in at 0.8% during the third quarter. And for Skin Health and Beauty, organic sales declined 2.7% with a 4.7% volume decline, partially offset by 2% of positive value realization driven primarily by carryover benefits. As Thibaut mentioned, the pace of recovery in the U.S. slowed in the quarter, underlining our need to strengthen the impact of our actions against an increasingly dynamic environment. We continue to diligently strengthen our teams and capabilities to fully and effectively deploy our new playbook. Moving on to adjusted gross margins, our operations team continued to drive meaningful productivity improvements, which in combination with favorable value realization, and a non-recurring separation related benefit, resulted in a year-over-year expansion of 130 basis points to 60.7%. In fact, we have improved adjusted gross margins year-over-year during the last five quarters. We're laser-focused on fostering a culture of efficiency and operational discipline, and you can see the productivity benefits in our adjusted gross margin this year. Our teams are relentless in driving procurement savings, extracting efficiencies through process automation, and leveraging digital upgrades that increasingly provide real time analytics, helping optimize logistics and demand management. All in the 60.7% adjusted gross margin level in the third quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations, but directionally aligned with the lower sequential progression that is typical in the second half of the year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically our lowest gross margin quarter given the timing of our annual plant maintenance. Turning to adjusted operating margin, which was 22.1% in the third quarter. It reflects strong gross margin improvement and initial benefits from Our Vue Forward, which were more than offset by our decision to increase our marketing investment this year, which is a key driver of our playbook. Our teams have successfully exited hundreds of TSAs with our former parent company without the operational disruptions that often accompany separations. As of today, we have exited approximately 70% of our TSAs and are on pace to exit all by mid-2025. The Our Vue Forward initiative is tracking to plan on efficiencies. Our Vue Forward equips us to operate more effectively and ultimately more competitively as we eliminate redundancies, reduce layers of hierarchy to drive faster decision making and implement new systems and automation to strengthen our capabilities in areas such as consumer insights and forecasting. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 21% to 22% in 2024, which factors the benefits from Our Vue Forward and our supply chain efficiencies and increase in brand activation investments. Closing out the P&L, net interest expense for the quarter was $96 million, given our year-to-date trend we for the year to be approximately $380 million. For taxes, the third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 28.9%, a bit higher than planned, primarily due to shift in jurisdictional mix of income and an increase in non-deductible costs. As such, we now expect a full year adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%. And finally adjusted net income was $542 million for the quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share worth $0.08. Now, to summarize our expectations for the full year 2024, as you heard from Thibaut, we expect organic growth towards the low end of the 2% to 4% range, we shared with you in the beginning of the year due to both the pace of recovery in Skin Health and Beauty and softer category dynamics in the back half of the year in Self Care and Skin Health and Beauty. As it relates to cold, cough and flu, at this point, we're tracking towards a late start to the season, given the levels of incidence we have seen so far. We are assuming foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 1% for the full year. And for adjusted diluted earnings per share, we are confirming a range of $1.10 to $1.20, as we see stronger than planned gains in productivity and efficiencies offsetting the impact of the softer top-line fueling the acceleration in brand investment for future growth and allowing us to deliver within our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. We plan to exit this year of profound transformation with healthy Self Care and Essential Health segments benefiting from our new playbook as well as a Skin Health and Beauty segment showing signs of stabilization in important parts of the business. All this powered by the leaner, more agile and fast moving organization with more opportunities to free up resources and increase investment in our brands. This makes us confident that we are on our way to drive strong value creation over time. Thank you. And with that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. I guess I had a question on your updated organic sales growth guidance. Although, it's now lower, it does still imply a decent step-up in Q4. So I was hoping for a little more color on the drivers of this. For instance, have you seen your shipments in October improve versus Q3? And I guess, I'm thinking about that in the context of maybe a little bit more of a more normalized flu and cost purchasing cycle. I guess, ultimately I'm trying to understand the visibility you have in light of the U.S. consumer and global macro pressures. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. Good morning, Bonnie, and thank you for your question about our updated guidance. So as you remember, the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year contemplated a number of different scenarios. From an organic growth point of view, from a revenue point of view, to start with, we are seeing several factors that are not helping externally. We talked about the slower category in allergies and pediatric fever we have seen so far the deceleration in the category, the Skin Health category that the whole industry is seeing. The consumer remains cautious in China. And to your question about Q4, so far, we are seeing a late start to the cold, cough and flu season, so that's certainly not helping. Having said that, we have things to do internally and especially in Skin Health and Beauty, as you heard in my prepared remarks. Regarding Q4, we continue to expect Q4 to be our strongest growth quarter for the year and two reasons to that. The first one is that we see -- we start seeing the cumulative impact of our new Kenvue playbook in action. And you heard many examples of that in the prepared remarks. The second reason is that we are having easier year-over-year comparisons in the fourth quarter. Two elements that negatively impacted Q4 last year are not repeating this year. The destocking and the portfolio rationalization we had last year. So these are tailwinds for us this year. Two other elements that negatively impacted Q4 last year are now part of the base with no comp benefits this year, the situation in China, but also the flu season, where we see so far both years comparable in terms of level of low incidence and the fact that we are seeing a slow start to the season. So that's how we see the fourth quarter and what guides our thinking in terms of revenue growth. Paul, do you want to give some color on the EPS? Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibaut. I agree with you completely on the top line. And despite this backdrop on EPS, we are very confident in our ability to deliver towards the middle of our $1.10 to $1.20 guidance range for the full year. And this is despite the investments that we're doing to activate our brands at step top levels and we're maintaining that. And that is fueled by the ongoing productivity improvements that we have been delivering and continue to expect to deliver. And it is both in the gross margin line and also through Our Vue Forward program with efficiencies being realized and we will continue to realize them going forward as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I was wondering if you could frame the most recent trends for Skin Health and what would you say are sort of the first initiatives for Andrew in this new role. And also if you can provide just how much of a drag China was for Dr. Ci:Labo, it sounds like maybe this was a little bit incrementally weaker sequentially. So I was wondering if you could clarify. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Anna. So on Skin Health and Beauty, the external environment is certainly not helping in the back half of the year. We had a slow sun season. You heard it from everybody. Sun care, which is an important business for us, did not contribute to growth as much as we would expect in a normal year. And throughout the third quarter, we started seeing a deceleration in the Skin Care category in the U.S. something that by the way, we expect to continue into Q4. And to your earlier point, we see continued softness in Asia. So the three elements combined are clearly slowing us down. Now there are also things we know we need to do better internally, right, and it's really applying the playbook, executing the playbook consistently with precision and at scale across the portfolio, continuing to secure more distribution, strengthening our in-store prominence, making sure that our marketing campaigns drive stronger conversion and that's what our teams are focused on. And so what are we doing differently in the back half of the year? On top of implementing this playbook, first and foremost, we are strengthening the team. We are bringing new talent, skills and capabilities. You may remember that we are moving next year to Summit New Jersey with our new headquarters. It's also an opportunity for us to build a new Skin Health and Beauty center of excellence with our teams co-located marketing, R&D operations to with new skills and capabilities in Skin Health and us welcoming Andrew this week is the latest addition to this team. We are also augmenting these internal capabilities with external partnerships. And you saw last week another example of that with our partnership with Dr. Bhanusali and Dr. Shah with the objective to strengthen innovation and communication on the Neutrogena brand specifically. And you will see the continued augmentation in our campaigns. So that's what we are focused on. Your question about our new leader for North America and Europe, Andrew, who joined us recently. We are happy to have Andrew join the team and augment our internal skills and capabilities. Andrew brings two decades of experience, strong track record in growing brands, turning around businesses, moving transformation agendas. He has a deep expertise in Skin Health and deep understanding of what it takes to win the math and masstige Skin Health and Beauty market in the U.S. So together with Charmaine, our Chief Growth Officer; Jan, our leader for North America, and the whole team; Andrew and everybody will amplify the green shoots we see with Neutrogena and build the momentum across the balance of our Skin Health and Beauty business. Paul Ruh : And Anna, let me answer your last question which is on DCL. On DCL, last year was in Q3, it was the beginning of where we experienced the anti-Japanese sentiment in China. So we are lapping that it's not material -- it was not material in Q3 and will not be a material factor in Q4 as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on what are the green shoots you're seeing and how Andrew is going to amplify, as you pointed out, Thibaut, the initiatives that you have been putting together. Understandably, you have a backdrop of a deceleration in Skin Health and Beauty. But thinking of the innovation that you put together, and you'll be putting for a while now, more digital investments and thinking about how much that increased AMP that you announced in the beginning of the year will translate into an accelerated improvement there. So anything you can give us in terms of timing when we should be expecting this to materialize. And for Paul, given the commentary you expanded a bit on the prepared remarks on the TSAs getting and the TMA is getting out. Just wondering where we should be thinking if you can update us with the savings that we've seen so far and how margins should evolve from here. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : All right. Good morning, Andrea. And so let me start with a question and then I will hand over to Paul. So your first question about the green shoots, how we are going to amplify them and the impact of our investment. So if you take a step back, this year, we are profoundly transforming the way we operate. We are changing our ways of working and we are increasing our investment and we do that across the portfolio. And we are pleased to see that our Self Care and our Essential Health segments are already responding well to this new playbook with very strong share gains in Self Care and two quarters in a row of volume growth in Essential Health. In Skin Health and Beauty, we are also applying the same playbook but we are disciplined in prioritizing how we are going after our recovery plan. And we have decided to focus on to start with the biggest areas. If you take Neutrogena, its sun and face and it's the in-store execution. And that what makes us confident that the playbook starts working is that where we started implementing our new playbook so far, we are seeing green shoots. So I'll give you a couple examples. We invested in strengthening our presence with dermatologists and we see a strong response in terms of recommendation by dermatologists and we are now back to where we were four years ago with face care. So that's really encouraging. In terms of in-store execution, it's an area where we have focused a lot of energy and it's good to see that since the planogram, where new planograms were put in place approximately mid-August. So halfway through the quarter, we see Neutrogena face going back to number one position in the U.S. in September and by the way, we see that continuing in October. So we now have eight weeks behind us of Neutrogena face being back to number one position in brick-and-motor track channels. So that's very encouraging. Same thing from a direct-to-consumer marketing and the effect of our marketing campaigns, our pivot to social media, our partnership with celebrities is clearly working in having us connect in a much more effective way with a younger audience and Gen Z consumers, which is also a focus area for us. You heard me talking about the 800 million views to-date on Neutrogena Collagen Bank. The same thing is happening on OGX. We have I think 1.2 billion views with our OGX relaunch campaign with Demi Lovato. So that's working, as I said early days, but that's an encouragement for us to continue in this direction and do more. So that's exactly what the team and Andrew will play a big part in this, what the team is focusing on. How do we amplify these green shoots, making sure that they are executed with even more precision at a larger scale and are not limited to Neutrogena face and sun, but are amplified across the rest of our skincare portfolio as well. Paul, do you want to take the second one on TSA and TMA exits? Paul Ruh : Of course. Andrea, good morning. So on TSAs, let me step back. TSAs were exiting them on track. I feel very pleased that we have not encountered any operational disruptions. So thank you team for doing that with excellence. And remember, the TSA exits will not necessarily allow us to exit in an optimized manner. That's why we have Our Vue Forward program. We are going to realize a few benefits, but given the time limitation we have to exit TSAs by mid next year. It's not necessarily an optimized exit. That's why we have Our Vue Forward program and we're tracking well. We announced it last quarter. We have started to realize some of the benefits of that Our Vue Forward program. We are on track to deliver the $350 million savings by 2026 where we'll be seeing the full impact. And it's not only about effectiveness, efficiency as well, and finding new ways of working in a leaner, more agile manner. Specifically on savings, what actions we have taken, we have taken a lot of the functional actions, procurement actions as well, and largely some of the org actions we have already taken as well. But we will continue to progress throughout the balance of the year and into 2025 as well. Your question is also around the impact to margins. We are starting to see some of the benefits of both, particularly Our Vue Forward and we expect to see the full impact more towards 2025 that will continue to be fueled for incremental marketing investments as well. So we are not there where we want to be from a competitive perspective in terms of investing behind our brands and the fuel that we get from Our Vue Forward, TSA exit and of course, gross margin expansion will allow us to continue to invest and deliver on our algorithm as well. So that's how I see things. Good progress so far and we will continue throughout the balance of the year and into next year as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So Thibaut, you kind of mentioned the two key reasons for weaker growth this year is kind of the weaker U.S. category trends and kind of the slower recovery in Skin Health and Beauty. And I guess, as we look forward here, I guess, I totally understand some of the one-offs you're going to be cycling in 4Q that would put organic growth more in line with the long-term algorithm. But just as you look out to next year, I'd be curious how you're thinking about the potential for weaker category growth to persist and maybe for a long recovery in Skin Health and Beauty to really impact your ability to return to on algorithm growth. I know we'll probably get 2025 guidance in a few months. But just curious if, based on where things stand today, would you anticipate some of these headwinds persisting into next year? Thanks. Paul Ruh : Peter, good morning. This is Paul. So thank you for the question. We're not going to talk about 2025 today. Look forward to our conversation in the future. But I can tell you that 2024 has been a year of profound transformation. We're very pleased with the progress we've made so far and that transformation will also continue into 2025. The transformation will allow us to accelerate our top-line growth from this year and grow at a faster pace than we are doing this year. Income will grow faster than sales. That's part of our algorithm. And we will continue to invest in our business. We're not at competitive levels yet as I mentioned, so that is part of our algorithm that will drive acceleration in top line sales. And of course, from a cash perspective, we will continue to return cash to shareholders with attractive dividends. All that is part of our shareholder returns. Specifically, in terms of categories, we are monitoring performance of categories. We contemplate a variety of scenarios. In the case of seasonal businesses, particularly in Self Care, we're seeing more a trend towards normalization. We will assess what that means in terms of normalization. But it's certainly some of the factors that we're going to be considering as we think about 2025. We do believe that 2024 has become a little bit of a new base. And from there, we will assess how things will continue to work. And on top of that, we'll continue to -- we will deliver in 2025 and beyond on our algorithm. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a question on retailer inventory levels. Some of your peers have talked about retailers being more cautious with their inventory ordering patterns, particularly in the Skin Care category. So I was wondering if you saw any impact in Q3 and what are your expectations for Q4. And then specifically for the drug channel, given the importance of the channel for your business, are you seeing any impact from the recent store closures from some key customers? And how should we think about that potential impact into Q4? Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Okay. Good morning, Filippo. So let me take the first one on inventory level. If I look around the world, in the U.S., we believe inventory levels are on the low side. If you remember, we had some destocking in some channels in first half of 2024 that did not continue in the third quarter. And we would not expect that to continue to happen in Q4 either given the low levels of inventory we see across channel. In general, in around the world, we see more cautious ordering patterns in healthcare categories given the low levels of incidence. And we would -- we have seen that in Q3. We certainly continue to see that in happening in Q4 until the season happens post. We are clearly in a post-pandemic, post-COVID world where supply chain are stable. And so we don't see retailers stocking up ahead of the season. And they are going to wait until they see demand pick up to order what they need. And as you heard from Paul and I, so far, we have not seen levels of incidents moving in the direction of a peak. For those of you live in the Northeast, you suddenly have seen that we had good weather so far. So net-net, I would expect us at Kenvue to exit 2024 with healthy levels of inventory around the world. Your specific question on the drug channel, I believe it's in the U.S. drug and pharmacy overall is a strong channel for us worldwide. It's doing very well outside of the U.S. In the U.S., the drug channel has indicated the decline in traffic coming off the pandemic highs. There has been recent announcement regarding future footprint consolidation that has not happened yet. And so we work very closely with our customers to make sure that we offer the right assortment to their shoppers. And so we will continue to work very closely with our retail partners when they move on with their consolidation plans. Every time, the store closes you see a short-term impact as the inventory present in this store is really ready into other stores. And so you may see a short-term impact when a store closes, but over time, it certainly does normalize. We do not sell discretionary products at Kenvue. By and large, we sell products you need and you are looking for very clear reason. And so if you cannot find your product or products in one store, we usually see consumers going to another store and to get the brand they trust and need. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Thank you, and good morning. Paul, your initial comments on 2025 were helpful. I wanted to sort of drill down and link it back to what Thibaut was talking about with respect to Skin Health and Beauty. In that business, you talked about the signs that the playbook is working in green shoots, which is great. On the other hand, the market backdrop is choppy. You're still sort of in the earlier sort of innings, I guess, of a real full turnaround in Skin Health and Beauty. Andrew just arrived, for example. So I guess, just as you think about 2025, in the context of that business, is the mentality and the objective that you're taking into 2025 one of just merely stabilizing that business year-over-year or is the ambition sort of the realistic ambition and the goal to actually grow that business next year? I'm hearing, I'm just not sure what I'm -- when I parse between all the different commentary, I'm not sure if you feel like the business is ready to grow next year or if we're still attempting to stabilize in 2025. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Steve, very good question. Let me be very clear. We are focused on returning the segment to growth and expect to do that in 2025. To your point, we need to see what happens to the category overall. From what we see today, I don't think we can count on an improvement in consumer sentiment in Asia. So for us 2025, it's really about fueling expansion in EMEA. It's working very well. How do we fuel this growth we are seeing and countering the deceleration we see in the category in the U.S. with a better execution of our playbook, better innovation, better campaign. So that's our plan for 2025. I gave you examples of green shoots in early green shoots in the parts of the portfolio we have prioritized thus far. Now, we need to expand across the segment with precision, at scale, continue to secure more points of distribution as the planograms flip in the back half of next year. In the meantime, strengthen in-store prominence, making sure that our marketing content drives stronger conversion and continuing to add new talent, skills, capabilities. So that's what we are going for. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Devas with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Keith Devas : Hey, thank you. Good morning. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to I guess, double back on a theme that I guess has been mentioned a couple of times, but it's not there's unique category softness yet you're proceeding with your reinvestment plans. And so I guess, I'm interested in how you guys think about if the category trends persist how that might change your thinking on where to reinvest and/or if it changes your expectations for a timeline on the return. It sounds like 2024 is a heavy investor in the year and 2025 will be as well. And so in light of the category trends, can a recovery or I guess, a rebound or a reinvigoration of growth still occur with some of reinvestments or how you might think about altering them in the context of the macro pressures. Thank you. Paul Ruh : Thank you for the question, Keith. We are confident in our ability to continue to source funds to invest in our brands from both our gross profit, our gross margins, and also Our Vue Forward. Remember, Our Vue Forward is a two-year program and we have been successful in getting the efficiencies and productivity out of that. We're not done in terms of investing at competitive levels. So we do believe we have the right building blocks to continue to fuel the funds for that growth. Of course, we're monitoring the -- our own performance and the category performance as well. But our algorithm calls for continued investment in our brands. This is not a one-time step-up and we will continue to approach in a very thoughtful manner a continued investment and thoughtful, what I mean is always based on return on investments, which is something what we have done all along. And we will make sure that our brands get the proper investment to not only get the right return but also the reach that we need to drive the penetration particularly in Skin Health and Beauty and continue to gain in Essential Health and in Self Care as well. So across the Board, we'll continue to invest thoughtful approach and we have the fuel to continue to drive the investment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thibaut, I just was curious how you think about the skincare kind of portfolio complexity. In your view, what would kind of be the hero products within the Neutrogena brand family and is there an opportunity maybe to streamline and simplify use transferable demand to kind of make sure that you're focusing on the right SKUs and allocating the right amount of money to the right SKUs. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Nik, very good question. The team does a good job prioritizing the biggest parts of the portfolio for each brand. So for example, I told you in Neutrogena; they are currently focused on sun and face that approximately 80% of our revenue in the U.S. for this brand. So we need to start by getting this part right. It's about making sure that we push the platforms. So Hydro Boost, for example, is one of our mega platforms, so we get a lot of synergies by promoting these range of products. It's also about doing a better job at unifying the brand and you will see initiatives in that area in 2025. And it's also making sure that the navigation and shopability is easier for consumers and shoppers in-store. And here I'm pleased with the progress that we are making in a number of retail partners this fall. You will see stronger brand blocks, easier to navigate with a shelving organization that helps consumers to pick the right products for what they need. That will certainly make our brands easy to shop in brick-and-mortar stores. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to touch a little bit on the gross margin this quarter. It did come in a little bit stronger and maybe you can talk through some of the puts and takes there. And as we think about Q4 and then even into 2025, what are some of the headwinds or even tailwinds that we should be cognizant of, especially around input cost inflation, transportation costs, et cetera. Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you for the question, Korinne. We are very pleased with the performance on gross margin. The team is very dedicated to making sure that we get the fuel for the growth for the brands and we have confidence in continuing to expand our gross margins going forward. The sources are value realization. Pricing will be less of a lever, but it will always be a component. Manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies are a big building block to improve our gross margins. When it comes to commodities, commodity trends are helping offset some of the increased labor and logistics inflation that we have recently seen, but the benefits of commodity tailwinds are probably going to start winding down. So we are continuing to balance all of the elements of how we build our gross margins. We, remember from a seasonality perspective or the progress throughout the year. Q4 is our highest investment year in plant maintenance, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So it's typically our lowest gross margin period, but it should not be within -- without outside our expectations. I said that we are close to the 60% for the full year and that's where we are at this point we're maintaining our outlook. Margin progression is not linear. Given all these dynamics that I mentioned. As I think about going forward, I do believe that these improvements are going to be closer and more to the targeted long-term gross margin expansion goals that we talked about, which are in the range of 20 basis points to 30 basis points on a sustainable basis in the long-term. So pleased with the performance. It will continue to be a strength of ours. We have the building blocks and it will be the fuel for our growth. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Jeremy Fialko with HSBC. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Fialko : Hi there, thanks for taking the question at the end of the call. So just a couple of things from me. So I guess, the first thing is, you've talked about all of these reasons why I guess, you're incrementally a little bit more cautious on the top-line. But I guess, a lot of them sound relatively transitory for me in terms of sun care kind of baked into the flu season. So I just wanted to draw out particularly focus on the U.S. the extent to which this is a kind of an underlying softening in the consumer rather than just a kind of accumulation of some of these slightly unfavorable phasing factors. And the second thing linked to that is, are there any areas where you might have seen some sort of a pickup in the price discounting or promotion? Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Okay, Jeremy, let me start with your first question about the external environment and the consumer in the U.S. When you look at the levels of incidence we had all year long across all geographies in terms of sun allergy, pediatric fever, it seems like flu is moving in the same direction, these low levels of incidence is -- we don't know yet if it's a new normal or not. But I would say, it's pretty unusual to have such low levels of incidence across geographies, across all these categories. In terms of -- but it doesn't reflect the state of the consumer. What we see with the consumer is the consumer continues to prioritize their health and the health of their loved ones, they don't compromise on that. Having said that, they are looking for convenience and value and you need to be very agile to make sure that you are present in all channels, which we are. And with price points that cater to the different needs of different consumers, so you can meet the consumer where they are and that's where we focus a lot of our attention. We don't see a trade down in terms of private label. You heard me give frequent reports on that. This quarter again, we didn't see a significant change in worldwide penetration of private label. Even in the largest highest penetrated category, which is the U.S. OTC category. We see private label penetration going down this quarter again. So that's what we see broadly for the consumer. From a promotional intensity point of view, when we look at all categories in the U.S. specifically, we don't see any increase in promotional intensity in the Self Care segment. We see a slight low-single-digit increase in Self Care and in Essential Health and Skin Health categories. But I would say nothing out of the ordinary and something that is more in line with, I would say, the new normal. Thibaut Mongon : So thank you for all your questions. That concludes our report on our Q3 performance. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. As you can tell, Kenvue continues to be in transformation with a strong progress on efficiencies and productivity, new ways of working, a continued investment in our new Kenvue playbook that will allow us to deliver within our outlook in terms of EPS despite a softer revenue in the back half of the year. With that, we wish you all a great rest of the good day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Sofya Tsinis, Head of Investor Relations for Kenvue. Sofya Tsinis : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Kenvue\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm pleased to be joined today by Thibaut Mongon, Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Ruh, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's call includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our operating and financial performance, market opportunities and growth.

With that, I'll turn it over to Thibaut. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you, Sofya. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin by sharing our performance and progress in 2024, then provide a review of our results for the fourth quarter. I'll close by discussing our outlook for 2025, with Paul building on some of these topics later in the call. Our organic sales growth for the year was 1.5%. This was below our expectations, and we are not satisfied with it. As we'll discuss later, this was due in part to lower-than-expected incidences of cough, cold and flu, which negatively impacted our pediatric pain franchise and a reduction in distributor orders in Asia Pacific, particularly China. While topline missed our expectations, we met or exceeded our expectations on other fronts. We meaningfully expanded our adjusted gross margin and took significant costs out of our infrastructure, which enabled us to increase investments in our brands. And we delivered adjusted diluted EPS for the year of $1.14, squarely within our guidance range. At the start of 2024, we outlined three priorities for Kenvue, reaching more consumers, freeing up resources to invest behind our brands, and fostering a new culture that rewards performance and impact. While we still have work ahead of us to accelerate growth, we made progress on each one of these priorities, so let me take each one in turn. First, to reach more consumers across our three segments, we strengthened our presence and prominence in-store and online, launched impact with innovation and expanded and deepened our engagement with consumers and healthcare professionals. In self-care, we strengthened our leadership positions with nearly 80% of the segment gaining share, including our largest brands, Tylenol, Zyrtec, and Nicorette, amongst others. In essential health, we grew mid-single digits and we delivered volume growth in North America, EMEA, and Latin America. And in skin health and beauty, we grew both volume and value in EMEA and Latin America, while exiting the year with volume growth in the US. We expect to build on this momentum to accelerate volume and organic sales growth in 2025. Second, we are taking significant cost out of the business to enable us to increase investment in our brands, and here we are ahead of our plans. We continue to expand adjusted gross margin, with an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year to a competitive 60.4%, driven in large part by strong productivity enhancements in our operations, the muscle that we continue to build as Kenvue. To put this into a longer-term perspective, this is more than 400 basis points ahead of pre-COVID levels. In addition, we successfully executed the first year of our view forward, our two-year initiative to become a more agile organization, with a more efficient cost structure, and are well on track to deliver $350 million of annualized savings by 2026. As a result of these actions, we were able to increase our total brand investment for the year by about 20%, a significant step toward our plan to reinvest more competitively in the growth of our brands. We invested in three areas. We increased our advertising budget to 10.6% of sales in 2024 compared to 8.7% in the prior year, and pivoted to social media influencer-led campaigns, which helped us expand our reach and fuel stronger brand health. We also ramped up our investment in healthcare professional engagement. In the US, for example, Neutrogena is now at its highest level of average recommendations by neuropathologists in the face category in the last four years. And we invested in stronger in-store presence and prominence, which, for example, contributed to the rapid expansion of Neutrogena, Aveeno, and OGX in Europe. Third, we have fundamentally shifted the way we work to embrace a culture of performance and impact across Kenvue. We introduced a new performance and incentive model directly tied to business outcomes, focusing all Kenvuers on our key priorities. And to complement our existing talent, we brought in new team members to elevate our capabilities and expertise across key areas of our business. We also enhanced our operating model, establishing global brand development teams who are responsible for growing their brands globally with integrated strategies, relevant innovation, and impactful communications. This model, now operational in 2025, is not only more effective, but more efficient, avoiding duplications of effort and driving greater accountability. Now, I'd like to turn to our fourth quarter results. In Q4, we delivered organic sales growth of 1.7% and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.26. While we were tracking in line with our organic sales growth outlook through November, growth fell short of our expectations in December, primarily due to two factors; one, much lower than expected incidences of cold, cough, and flu had an outsized impact on our pediatric pain franchise in the US and in China. And two, we had a reduction in customer orders in Asia Pacific, particularly in China, where we experienced temporary disruption in our distribution network for essential health and skin health brands. This was driven by secondary distributors who faced liquidity issues and did not fully execute activation programs. When in the process of replacing these underperforming distributors and reclaiming direct responsibility for activation with key local retailers to avoid this issue in the future. These two factors were unfortunately large enough to mask real progress in the other parts of our business. To help further dimensionalize the impact of the significant decline of pediatric pain incidents on our revenue, total company organic sales growth without this franchise would have been about two points higher in the fourth quarter and about one point higher for the full year 2024. Now, looking at each segment, I'll begin with self-care, which grew organic sales by 2.9% in the fourth quarter. As noted, the low flu season led to a double-digit decline over the last year in our pediatric pain franchise as the category contracted over 40% in China and nearly 11% in the US, our two largest markets. December was much weaker than our and industry projections as the typical peak in pediatric incidences did not occur. Retailers responded by limiting their orders, and in China by starting to reduce the inventories they had built ahead of the season. Without pediatric pain, this was a terrific quarter for our self-care segments, with organic sales growing high single digits, as Nicorette grew nearly 20%, our digestive health franchise grew mid-teens and allergy grew high single digits. We continue to drive consumer awareness and amplify innovations such as Tylenol easy to swallow through innovative consumer-centric campaigns. Importantly, we continue to gain share in self-care in the fourth quarter, including in pediatric pain where we grew share globally by 70 basis points versus last year. In essential health, where organic sales decreased 0.7% in the fourth quarter, we faced a material headwind from the decline in customer orders in Asia Pacific, particularly China that I discussed earlier. Importantly, we do not see this decline in orders reflecting the rate of consumption in the region. Outside of Asia Pacific, the segment grew at a healthy mid-single digit rate in Q4, with a third consecutive quarter of volume growth. Innovation continues to play an important role as we drive household penetration in these categories where we command leadership positions. For example, we continue to expand Listerine clinical solutions in the US where the line was the number one innovation in 2024. Our Aveeno kids range is the fastest-growing line in its US category, and our Band-Aid Pro Heal innovation continues to do very well, driving more than a third of our wound care growth in the US for the year. Finally, in skin health and beauty, we delivered volume-led 2.6% organic sales growth for the quarter, albeit on the soft base. EMEA and Latin America continue to be growth engines for the segment, and we drove volume-led double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter across both regions. In EMEA specifically, Q4 was our 11th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, with all our major brands, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and OGX growing nicely. And we continue to expand in the region with the launch of Aveeno in 12 central European markets. In North America, we delivered mid-single-digit organic sales growth during the quarter as we continue to see improvements in the areas we have prioritized thus far. For example, during the fourth quarter, Neutrogena, our largest brand in skin health, regained its position as the number one face care brand in all US channels, offline and online. And our Neutrogena cleansing platform, an important entry point for the brand, grew share in the brick-and-mortar channels in the fourth quarter, with a combined effect of increased points of distribution, attractive entry price points on specific codes, influencer-led consumer communication, and innovation with our new Ultra Gentle cleansers line. While 2024 showed the recovery is not linear and is taking longer than anticipated, we remain encouraged by this progress. In 2025, we will amplify our innovations and further strengthen our competitiveness. As an example, as part of our strategy collaboration with Dr. Shah that we announced in Q4, we launched a new major campaign earlier this week featuring artist Tate McRae, our newest Neutrogena ambassador. This is a great example of our ambition for the brand with a popular global Gen Z music sensation, and the most followed dermatologist on social media, getting together to recommend the number one face care brand in America. So, let's now turn to our outlook for 2025. We're entering 2025 with a challenging external environment, economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and a stronger dollar. In parallel, consumers continue to look for convenience and value but are not compromising on their health. So, given this backdrop, we expect our weighted categories to grow below historical average in 2025 in the range of 2% to 3% in the geographies where we compete. At Kenvue, we are now approximately 90 days from completing what has been a long and resource-intensive operational separation from J&J. To put it in perspective, we exited over 2,000 TSAs in more than 50 countries through the end of 2024 without business disruption. Having now completed approximately 85% of the planned exits, our team continue to find better, simpler, and more cost effective ways to operate as an independent company. And as one of the last steps in this separation, we'll officially open our new Kenvue headquarters in Summit, New Jersey, next month. With TSA exits behind us in 2025, we are ready to enter the next chapter of our journey as an independent company, with our number one priority being centered on accelerating profitable growth and generating sustainable value creation. We expect to deliver 2% to 4% organic sales growth in 2025, and grow revenue faster than our categories in the second half of the year. We're confident in our outlook for 2025 for several reasons. First, we will realize the compounding benefits from the structural changes we implemented in 2024. This year, we will fully activate our new operating model, with strong talent, a leaner organization, greater efficiencies, and clear roles and responsibilities. Our brands will benefit from a second year of higher investment levels, supported by a healthier P&L, with stronger gross margins and lower infrastructure costs. And we will be more agile and move faster, enabled by technology and capabilities that are right for Kenvue as a standalone consumer health company. And second, we have strong plans to drive momentum across our three segments in 2025. We will launch 40% more innovation compared to 2024, which will further strengthen our portfolio through premiumization, extension into adjacencies, and attractive entry price points. We expect net distribution gains this year, driven by the healthy innovation lineup and strengthened retailer partnerships, leading to higher prominence of our brands. And our brands will be supported by more competitive trade and marketing investments, with stronger partnerships with celebrities, influencers, and healthcare professionals. We have streamlined our roster of advertising agencies and have recently launched our new global content factory, which will drive more impactful content with greater efficiencies. We'll have the opportunity to talk more about our 2025 plans and our next chapter at CAGNY later this month. While our innovation and marketing support are expected to be equally strong throughout the year, our first half results will not reflect the underlying health of our business as they will be negatively impacted by two main factors, destocking largely due to the lingering impacts of the weak pediatric pain season and the disruption we are correcting in China, and the strategic investment we're making in selective price reductions and trade spend in the US to improve our competitiveness. Importantly, while reinvesting in our brands, we'll continue to be extremely disciplined in the management of our P&L, and we expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2025. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul. Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibault, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with an overview of results for the fourth quarter and the year, and then close with the details around our outlook for 2025. Fourth quarter organic sales grew 1.7% versus last year, which was disappointing due to the reasons that Thibault highlighted. Organic sales growth in the quarter was relatively balanced between value realization and volume. We drove favorable value realization across all segments and volume growth in both self-care and skin health and beauty. Overall, volume increased 0.7% year-over-year. Value realization contributed 1% to organic sales growth, primarily driven by incremental pricing outside the US. For the year, organic sales increased 1.5%, with value realization of 2.7% and consolidated volume declines of 1.2%. Going forward, we expect a more normal balance between value realization and volume, with a skew to volume increases to drive our organic sales growth. Taking a look at our segments. In the fourth quarter, self-care organic sales grew 2.9% year-over-year as volumes and value realization contributed 1.7% and 1.2% of growth, respectively. As Thibault mentioned, the segment delivered very strong organic sales growth, except for pediatric pain, which was a significant drug on the segment and the company growth. Importantly, in self-care we continue to gain share across categories globally for the quarter and full year. In skin health and beauty, organic sales grew 2.6% year-over-year in the quarter as volume increased 2.1% on easier comparisons, and value realization contributed 0.5%. Pricing actions abroad more than offset the impact of our strategic investment behind select price reductions and in-store activation in the US. We remain focused on building further traction with our commercial efforts to strengthen these segments\u2019 performance. And for essential health, organic sales decline 0.7% in the quarter, with value realization increasing 1.2% year-over-year, which was more than offset by volume declines of 1.9%. While organic sales for essential health grew 4.1% for full year, which was the fastest growth in recent years, the fourth quarter was an outlier, primarily due to a reduction in customer orders in Asia Pacific, particularly in China. Without Asia Pacific, organic sales for essential health grew mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, with Latin America and North America leading the charge. Moving now to adjusted gross margin, our operations team drove meaningful productivity improvements in 2024, expanding adjusted gross margin by 200 basis points versus last year to 60.4%. As anticipated, in the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin came in at 58.7% versus 59.5% last year, which as you may recall, included a non-recurring benefit of approximately 50 basis points. In Q4, we continued to generate supply chain efficiencies and value realization, which helped offset inflationary headwinds. Adjusted operating margin was 19.2% in the quarter and landed at 21.5% for the full year, right at the midpoint of our 21% to 22% guidance range. Recall, we raised our total brand investment in 2024 by about 20%, with cost savings and gross margin improvement funding this spend. As of 2024 year-end, we're more than halfway through realizing our view forward savings, and are well on track to get the full annualized run rate of $350 million by 2026. Closing out the P&L, net interest expense was $95 million for the quarter and $378 million for the full year of 2024, in line with our expectations. For taxes, fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 17.7%, and full year adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5%, slightly below our expectations due to the realization of discrete tax benefits. And finally, adjusted net income was $499 million for the quarter or $0.26 of adjusted diluted EPS. Full-year adjusted net income was $2.2 billion or $1.14 adjusted diluted EPS, within our 2024 guidance range. Before discussing the outlook for this year, I'd like to take you through two internal initiatives that we are deploying to upgrade data and analytics across multiple facets of Kenvue as part of the evolution of our company. First, as we continue our revenue growth management effort, we are deploying a global center of excellence that will support our markets with strategic pricing and promotion capabilities. We're also implementing new trade spend management technology in select markets, which will facilitate more robust management of trade investment and better inform promotional spending decisions, all to further improve effectiveness. Second, we will complete the global rollout of integrated business planning, with enhanced digital capabilities in 2025. The new IBP process and AI-driven tools will improve the level of information that supports our financial forecasting, enhancing planning accuracy. Also, while these upgraded systems and processes do not protect against some demand changes, they collectively enable greater agility and more timely decision-making, significantly enhancing our ability to respond to shifting market trends. Now, to summarize our expectations for the full year 2025, we expect organic sales growth to be in the 2% to 4% range, representing an acceleration from 2024 levels, with growth expected to be volume-led. Our assumptions are grounded on approximately 2% to 3% growth across the categories and markets where we compete. Based on current spot rates, we're assuming currency will be an approximately 3% headwind to our top-line, resulting in expected net sales in the range of down 1% to up 1%. As you heard from Thibault, we have strong commercial plans for the year for each one of our segments as we bring and amplify more innovation to market, leverage our growing marketing muscle, continue to build distribution and realize benefit from revenue growth management. At the same time, we're coming into 2025 with more competitive brand support levels, with the goal to accelerate consumption. We also expect our teams to execute at a higher level in 2025 behind the full adoption of our new operating model. Looking at our segments, for the full year we expect self-care organic sales growth will accelerate from 2024 levels, building on our strong leadership positions and continuing to introduce differentiated innovation. In skin health and beauty, we expect to return the segment on a global basis back to organic sales growth in 2025 as we continue to strengthen our US business while driving ongoing solid performance in EMEA and Latin America. And finally, in essential health, as pricing rolls off, we expect to deliver more moderate organic sales growth in 2025, with broad-based growth across the categories. From a quarterly progression, as Thibault mentioned, destocking and strategic price investments will impact the cadence of Kenvue\u2019s top-line and margin performance in the first half of the year. Combined, we estimate these factors will account for a three to four point headwind in the first quarter. As a result, we expect organic sales to decline low single digits in Q1. We expect these headwinds on top-line to moderate in the second quarter. These dynamics will mask the underlying health of the business in the first half of the year. As we cycle through them, organic sales growth is expected to be much stronger in the back half of the year relative to the front half. In parallel, we expect 2025 to be another year of strong productivity and efficiencies for our company. We are continuing to accelerate automation, streamline end-to-end processes, optimize spend, leverage digital and AI to enhance logistics and demand management, and are on track to realize the balance of our view forward savings. These combined savings will more than offset the investments we're making behind the business to increase our brand's competitiveness, as well as inflationary and foreign exchange-related headwinds that we are facing this year. As a result, we're planning for adjusted operating margin to expand year-over-year. Given the fluidity of the recent tariff announcements, we have not factored in any impact in this outlook. We are assuming a fairly similar net interest expense to 2024 and adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5% to 26.5%, with about 1.93 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We're planning to grow adjusted diluted EPS on a constant currency basis, slightly ahead of organic sales growth, even as we continue to reinvest at higher rates behind our brands. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be flat to up 2%, including a mid-single digit headwind from currency. In closing, 2025 will be an important year for Kenvue. As we put our separation from J&J behind us, we enter the next chapter of our journey as an independent company and aim to unleash acceleration in our profitable growth. Our teams around the world are ready and I want to thank them for the passion and focus on helping more consumers realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. Before we open the call for questions, you may have seen the filing that was recently made by Starboard Value. We engage regularly with our shareholders and are open to constructive dialogue and suggestions from all Kenvue shareholders. With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our 2024 results and 2025 outlook. We appreciate your keeping your questions focused on these topics, and we will not be making any further comments on our shareholder conversations or denominations at this time. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask two clarification on the organic sales growth guidance for 2025. First, in terms of like the negative impacts that you saw in Q4 both on cold and flu and essential health, can you give us a sense of like what is the contribution of the drag in Q1? Particularly in cold and fluid, it seems like the case count has really picked up in the end of December, beginning of January. So, are you assuming you're not going to get a restocking on new cold and flu, especially the pediatric cold and flu medicine that you called out? And then on the kind of Asia Pacific inventory issues, can you walk us through like what impact are you expecting going forward and how long it would take you to fix the disruptions that you called out? Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, good morning, Filippo. And so, question about our guidance for 2025, let me start by talking about how we feel confident about our guidance overall. If you think about our starting point, we grew 1.5% in 2024. You heard me say in the prepared remarks that without pediatric pain, we would've grown one point higher as a company. So, I would say our run rate exiting 2024 is about 2.5%. If you add to that the stronger plans we have for 2025, and the fact that we are going to benefit from the compounding impact of the structural changes we did in 2024, that's what gets us to the midpoint of our guidance. Now, what will bring us up or down versus this mid-point will be driven by the quality of the execution and how consumers respond, but also the seasonal businesses and how the seasons are going to behave in 2025. So, if the seasons are positive, it will tilt towards the higher end of the guidance. If it's not the case, it will tilt towards the lower end of the guidance. Now, as you said, we expect - while we have strong operational plans through the full year, we expect in the first quarter to have two factors that will depress our results and mask the underlying health of the business. The first one is a linear impact of the low pediatric pain incidents that we saw in Q4. And you are right, we are not expecting uptick in Q1 for two reasons. In markets like the US, while we saw an uptick at the beginning of January, then a decline in the middle of January, and we see a slight uptick again recently, it has been pretty erratic, and I think it's too soon to call for an upside in the US. In China, the go-to market is different. Distributors and stores tend to stock up ahead of the season. They had a low season in Q4, as we talked about. And so, even if the incident goes up in Q1, we would expect them to destock and to bleed their inventory in Q1 with no impact on our shipments. And the second reason that will impact the first quarter on that front is the lingering impact of the distribution disruption we saw in China will take a little bit of time to fix. Paul, do you want to add something? Paul Ruh : Thank you, Thibault. Yes, and I said in my prepared remarks, Filippo, the factors that Thibault referred to are a drag of about three to four points. So, the combination of the low start to the season, particularly in pediatrics, and also the lingering impacts of the distribution issues we have in China and Asia Pacific in general. There's one more factor that I would like to mention that gets us to the top-line of low single digits in Q1, which is trade investments that we\u2019re stepping up in the first half of 2025. As we think holistically about our brand investment, we not only have brand marketing investments through advertising, but we are also making sure that our promotional spend in store is competitive, and we're doing that primarily in the US through trade investment and promotional programs. So, that's how I get to the number that I explained before. This is temporary. It does not say much about the underlying health of the business because as those impacts cycle through, we will see the acceleration in the second half of the year as we see the full impact of our plans, including the benefits of our GM, the full impact of our brand plans and some of the absence of the headwinds we saw in 2024. So, strong operational plans underlying these impacts that I described. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just to follow up on that I would love to get some perspective on just the category growth assumptions. I think you mentioned 2% to 3% globally. Can you maybe share how you see that playing out in the US versus what you might expect internationally? And then just on the guidance, I think you just mentioned an acceleration in the back half of the year. So, should we interpret that as 2Q organic sales growth is going to be muted as well. And then maybe just taking the flip of Filippo\u2019s question, I mean, what are you assuming in the fourth quarter? Are you assuming that you get these headwinds that you dealt with from weaker cough and cold from the inventory disruptions? Are you assuming they come back and that's part of the improvement that you're embedding in the back half of the year? Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, Peter, good morning. So, let me take you question on the category assumptions for 2025, and Paul will follow up on the phasing in 2025. So, we indeed expect our categories to slow down from 3% to 4% to 2% to 3% in 2025. I would say the main reason, Peter, is the fact that you will have a much lower impact of price in 2025 compared to 2024. From a consumer point of view, what we see is on one hand, consumers are clearly focused on convenience and value, but they are also extremely focused on the health and the health of their loved ones, and they are not ready to compromise on this. And we see it with the example of private label penetration that continues to be, I would say, about flat on a global basis. And actually, if I look at the most recent periods, private label penetration in our categories going down in aggregate. So, I would expect consumer to continue to be focused on high quality, differentiated, superior health solutions. But we will have a lower roll of pricing in 2025, definitely. Paul, do you want to speak about the phasing? Paul Ruh : Sure. Thank you, Thibault. And Peter, good morning. I described the dynamics in Q1. Particularly for the second quarter, we will see, we do see an acceleration. We expect an acceleration and it's into positive territory. It's not all the way to the full strength of our plans because the dynamics in China will take more than one quarter to be fixed. So, again, it does not demonstrate the full impact of our plans. When it comes to the fourth quarter assumptions. You are right, what we are talking about in Q4 is the absence of the headwinds that we saw in Q4 of 2024. We expect a normal season overall in cold, cough, and flu. And we also see selective price actions outside the US and the full impact of our plans, with the most strengths being seen in Q4 of 2025. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anna Lizzul with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Anna Lizzul : Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to ask on skin health and beauty in particular, the volumes starting to recover here in the fourth quarter, and I was wondering just if you can give more insight on the innovation pipeline and any potential for shelf space gains in 2025. I was wondering if you're expecting maybe a better sun care season and then potentially shelf space gains in the fall. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : All right, good morning, Anna. Let me take this one. So, as far as skin health and beauty is concerned, our recovery as we saw in 2024 is taking longer than initially anticipated. Having said that, we see that our plans are working when you see our progress in the areas where we focus our efforts. We continue to see very strong traction in Europe and Latin America, and we would expect continued traction in 2025 in this region. We have strong plans in terms of distribution, innovation and communication. And in North America, we are very encouraged by the positive signs we keep seeing in the region. And you saw that we got our leadership back across all channels in the fourth quarter of online and offline. And so, in 2025, we will amplify these efforts to more parts of the portfolio. We have, I would say largely - to a large extent, revamped our skin health and beauty team with strong talent in 2024. And you start seeing the impact of what this team is doing. We are going to roll out a much stronger innovation pipeline in 2025 in the US and around the world. And this will be supported by strong, and I would even say stronger campaigns as we pivot to social media influencer-led campaigns and really execute them at a stronger level. You look at the campaign we just released this week with Tate McRae, we got 1 billion earned media impressions in the first 24 hours. That's five times the engagement rate on organic social media. This is what we would expect from industry benchmark. So, up to a very good start. Our investment in healthcare professionals is working as well, and we will continue to invest in this area. So, more innovation in skin health and beauty. I will not get into the details of what it will look like for obvious reasons, but we are starting with revitalize Hydro Boost session campaign in the first quarter. We're building on the innovation we launched in the fourth quarter on new skin care lines and our Collagen Bank line, which is off to a good start. We'll also increase distribution. To your question about sun care, we feel good about the upcoming season in terms of retailer partnerships. We'll see how the season plays out, but we feel we are well prepared getting into the season and we'll continue to invest behind our healthcare professional recommendation. So, all in, that's what makes us confident that we will return the segment to growth in 2025 on a global basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Can you just elaborate more on the temporary trade investments you're embedding in guidance? And should we expect, I understand like the 3% mid-point of organic sales growth to be mostly driven by volumes and in the second half and in the price realization to be negative in the US, but positive abroad with FX-led pricing. So, hopefully, like if you can kind of break it down if it's fair to assume, number one, that you obviously will have potentially less price realization, but some, as you mentioned before, Thibault, I think you, to another question, had said you expect to have pricing towards the back end of the year. And then on the operating margin guidance that Paul had mentioned to be above 2024, I understand the puts and takes here is like the synergies are coming in, in line with what you expected. And then, but that's going to be a gross margin accretion. And then your SG&A will have that A&P investment. And I think that's one of the things that we haven't discussed on the call yet is the 11% it still holds in 2025, or you are actually investing even more because when you say investment in spending, it's obviously above the line, but you also had said that you are putting more programs in place at the retailer. So, I was wondering if that number is appropriate and if you feel this is going to be where you're going to land in 2025. I'll stop here. Thibaut Mongon : Okay, Andrea, thank you for your question. I will start with your question on what we really mean by our strategic pricing investments, and then Paul will take your question on SG&A and gross margin. So, what are we talking about when we talk about pricing investment? As we reposition Kenvue for accelerated growth, you see that we are taking deliberate actions across the business to make us more competitive. One aspect of this competitiveness is making sure that our brands are at the right price points for consumers versus our competition. In 2025, we are making adjustments to our business, especially in the US to ensure that this happens. We are not doing it across the board. We are doing it in select brands, in select codes that where we see an opportunity to be more competitive and be rewarded with higher volume if we become more competitive. I will not give you more details for obvious competitive reasons, but I can give you examples of what it looks like. An example is one thing we are correcting is that in the past, we have made some price increases, and for certain codes we crossed certain price thresholds that impacted our volumes. So, after doing a few successful pilots in 2024, where we have checked that going back down below these price thresholds, we're driving volume. We are doing - we are implementing those, again, on select codes in 2025. Another example of an investment we're making is simplifying the number of price points within specific brands. In certain brands over time, the number of price points had grown, prohibiting us from co-promoting different products within the same brand at the same price point. We are simplifying this in 2025, reducing the number of price points, which will allow us to co-promote our products more effectively and make our displays more effective. So, all of that ends up being an investment in the short term, but we are confident that it'll turn into volume growth in the mid to long term. Paul Ruh : Great. Thank you, Thibault. And let me put some numbers behind your questions. First of all, you asked whether this will have an impact on volumes, or are we going to have negative value realization in the US. The answer is yes. We do expect negative value realization in the US primarily in Q1 and in Q2 behind these promotional spend investments. We see brand investment holistically push and pull. That's how every other consumer company does it. And our marketing mix will allow us to be much more competitive at the point of sale and also supported by our brand investments. So, what do we expect in the balance of the year? In the second half, those will be rolling out. We will be in the right - with the right price points, and we will also taking price in the balance of the award, and that will allow us to have positive value realization overall towards the second half of the year. How are we funding all of these? That's your second part of your question. We do have very concrete and strong plans both on the gross margin line and on the operating margin line. So, when it comes to gross margin, you know that we have delivered a trajectory of gross margin enhancements. We do have line of sight to more building blocks, particularly driven by efficiencies end to end in our value chain. Not at the same pace as in the past, of course, but we do see gross margin accretion, modest gross margin accretion in 2025. And when it comes to SG&A, we do believe we have still some room to go in terms of our A&P investment, again, but a much more moderate level. We're thinking about these push and pull marketing mix models. And we will be very thoughtful about the ROI of both our top and brand marketing investments. But we still want to invest more while we are able to deliver on our algorithm that we talked about, our guidance that we talked about, which is growing our operating margins year-over-year. So, those are the puts and takes. And we believe we have strong efficiency plans because we want to continue to fuel our brands both from a push and pull perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bonnie Herzog : All right, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I actually had a question on your self-care segment margins, which contracted a lot in Q4 and for the full year. So, as you guys called out, the flu season has been tracking much weaker, I guess, than expected. But just hoping for a little more color on how we should think about segment margin trajectory from here, especially in the context of maybe subdued price mix growth moving forward, and then certainly some of your reinvestment plans. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Bonnie, thank you for the question. I would not place too much emphasis on the quarterly margin by segment. Remember, there's fluidity between the different segments, and also it is impacted by mix. We talked about the fact that our pediatrics business saw declines, and that certainly impacted our mix. temporarily I would say it had the lowest gross margin in self-care of the year, but that is temporary. If you think about our overall operating margin performance, we were squarely within the guidance that we talked about. So, overall consolidated operating margin was 21.5%. So, we contemplated all of these investments and there are puts and takes when it comes to mix, how we drive our brand investments. And we do see, as we think about 2025, a little bit of an acceleration in self-care gross margin. We will continue to invest in skin health, as we talked about both in the push and the pull, and essential health will continue to be driving operating margin enhancement for that incremental operating margin that I described. So, those are the puts and takes between the different segments and also how mix plays. And all of this is supported by strong efficiency programs overall. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Hey, thanks so much for the question. I'd like to touch a little bit more on kind of like the cadence of the margin trajectory. I know you're talking about a little bit of modest expansion for the full year, but any more deeper color you can provide us on what to expect for Q1 for the gross margin operating margin line and how that should progress over the year. And then maybe you could touch a little bit on some of your risk mitigation plans as it relates to potential tariffs. I know it's a still pretty dynamic situation right now and a lot of uncertainty, but how much flexibility do you think you have to offset with pricing and some supply chain enhancements to drive better productivity if tariffs were to take hold. Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Thank you for the question, Korinne. When it comes to our margin evolution throughout the year, both on the gross margin and on the operating margin level, it will be follow a little bit of the top-line trajectory given the leverage that we're seeing, the investment levels that we're seeing, the pricing that I talked about. So, it will be more muted towards the first half of the year, particularly in Q1. And we will see an acceleration towards the second quarter and particularly the third quarter. Remember, we talked about the normal cadence that our gross margin follows. Usually, the second quarter is the highest one. We will see some investment. So, we'll probably see a little bit of a shift more towards the third quarter. And normally the fourth quarter has the associated costs related to plant maintenance, et cetera. So, it'll follow that trajectory. Net-net we see a more muted Q1, accelerating towards the second quarter, third quarter as well, and then going to the normal levels in Q4. So, that's the cadence of our gross margin and operating margin. And when it comes to tariffs, of course, that we're following closely. We established a team that's dedicated end-to-end to tracking the impact of these tariffs. And we have very, very - plans that we're ready to trigger. And our exposure is mostly between - at this point, between the US and Canada. That's where the majority of the cross-border trade happens. We do see - we do have imports from Canada to the US, very little from Mexico and a small part from China. And we have a variety of levers that we are pulling. And those include, of course, alternate sourcing. We are considering potential pricing actions, but we are not triggering at this point given the fluidity. We are ready, we have the playbook ready, and we will be ready to take actions in the short term and also in the long term. The guidance that we have does not include any impact of any tariffs, and that's something that we will be of course working closely with our customers to ensure that we continue to provide consumers with the right value equation. But we are ready whenever it comes. Our playbook is ready to be activated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Nik Modi : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thibault, Paul, I was wondering if you could remind us on how the incentive compensation works, particularly for the regional managers. And I'm asking this in the context of, are they compensated or the targets post FX just given the movement of the dollar versus the rest of the world? And sometimes there's a tendency for folks to pull back on spending to hit post FX numbers. And so, I just wanted to get some clarity around that, and if you had any thoughts around mitigating that risk, if that is in fact how you compensate. Thibaut Mongon : So, Nik, the metrics that we have for everyone in the company and by the way, we have an approach to one Kenvue, includes it's all in. So, we have the levers to be able to offset as much as possible forex impacts. And we do not give any dispensation to any teams regarding Forex. Our plans are on a - as they are reflected externally in line with our guidance. We talked about organic sales, and we also talked about our EPS on a constant currency basis. But we have - we track both. An important thing that I wanted to mention is that we do have hedging programs, and we have those for the purpose of predictability, and we employ them very rigorously. And last thing I wanted to mention is that in 2025, we have already factored in the headwinds that I referred to, so mid-single digits headwinds in EPS. And that's how we compensate our teams. So, it's a holistic approach. It's one team approach. And we are not going to take the foot off the pedal when it comes to investment in our brands. Remember, we talked about in 2024 that we would be investing $400 million more in advertising, and that's exactly what we did. And we will make other trade-offs, but the majority of the efforts will be towards more taking complexity and unrewarded complexity and other non-value added costs out of our P&L to be able to protect the investments despite potential swings in currency. Remember, it's organic, it's one team, and that's how we evaluate our teams. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. So, sneaking in a clarification, and then a real question. Clarification was just, in the prepared remarks, I thought you said that skin health and beauty was up mid singles in the US, which if that's the case in EMEA and Latin America were up double digits in volume. I just wanted to understand the total result of 2.5%. the more interesting question, the go-to-market in Asia, you called out in particular essential health, but I was curious what the route to market is for the other categories there. And also just there's a range of what it means to use distributors in China, right? There's the, we put stuff on a ship and it's like very hands off, which I don't think is what you do, because I know you have significant local operations. And the other side is it's just getting the product from point A to point B. So, I was just curious to understand where you fall currently on that continuum, and with the changes you're looking to make, what it will look like after the fact and if there is sort of investment you need to make in local capabilities, staffing, and so on to complete that journey. Thanks. Thibaut Mongon : Yes, thank you, Lauren. So, very quickly on your first question, you are absolutely right. The US grew mid single-digit in skin health and beauty in the fourth quarter, and EMEA and LatAm grew very strongly double-digit. We are very pleased with the performance of the segment in EMEA and LatAm, and we are encouraged to see these improvements in the US. Regarding your question about our route to market in China, so remember, the majority of our business in China is in self-care. And for this part of the business, we have one dedicated route to market with distributors who are specialized in serving hospitals and pharmacies across the country. For the non-regulated, if you will, part of the portfolio by essential health and skin health, we use different types of distributors. We serve directly what we call our tier one distributors who are more at the provincial level. And these distributors sell themselves to lower tier distributors, wholesalers who serve supermarkets, grocery stores in the different tiers of cities and villages in China. So, that's how it works. What we are doing about it as we speak, is two things, one, replacing the distributors who are clearly facing difficulties in the current environment in China, which as we all know, continues to see a consumer that is cautious about consuming products and are facing liquidity issues. The second thing we are fixing is where we relied too much on these lower tier distributors to activate our brands, we are deploying our teams to reclaim responsibility for the negotiation with these key local retailers of our brand activation teams. That will give us two benefits, one, the better handle of the activation of our brands in these lower tiers in the country, and two, more visibility on the quality of the execution in in this lower tier customers. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Steve Powers : Thank you very much, and good morning. Thibault, maybe just to close the loop on Lauren's prior clarification question. If the US and EMEA and Latin America were all sort of comfortably above the segment average, it implies a pretty weak Asia Pacific result. So, if you can just amplify or clarify a little bit a little bit on that. My real question was on - it's actually on cash flow and just your expectations of cash relative to the $1.14, $1.17 and EPS that you called. If my math is right, fiscal 2024 conversion of cash kind of came in around 60%. You've obviously previously framed the evergreen target at 100% plus. So, just with the TSA exits winding down, how much progress do you think you'll be able to make against that 100% plus target in 2025? And then more broadly, when do we think we can get back to achieving that long-term run rate on a more consistent basis? Thank you. Thibaut Mongon : Yes. So, very quickly on your first question, you're absolutely right, Steve. The quarter was not positive for Asia Pacific for the reason I mentioned in China. Paul, do you want to take the one on free cash flow? Paul Ruh : Yes, happy to. So, just to set the stage free cash flow in 2023 was $2.7 billion. Free cash flow in 2024 was $1.3 billion. If we think about what happened between 2023 and 2024, it's about half and half. The first half is separation-related items. For example in 2023, we had a partial year of interest, a partial year of company costs. And the other one were operational elements. In 2024, we had a particular year end where we didn't have the normal number of working dates at the end of the year. So, from an AR perspective, we had a headwind. And remember, we're also investing in our view forward. We're reinvesting to exit the TSAs. So, we're very thoughtful and prudent about how we invest in our business for long-term success. So, that explains the 2023 to 2024. So, half and half. If you think about going forward, we are expecting to get closer to the cash conversion that I talked about, but we will not get there in 2025. We will continue to invest in our view forward. We still are investing in TSAs, particularly TSA exit, particularly in IT, which requires investment in SAP and other platforms. And it will give us an opportunity to become much more agile. So, those are the right investments that we're doing. And we also talked about the fact that we're moving to our Summit headquarters. It will drive the right energy, the right collaboration within our team. So, with those investments behind us, we see very clear line of sight to getting to that 90% to 100% cash conversion. But as you know, the separation and the investments that we're going through to set ourselves up for clear success require investment temporarily. And then we will have a very strong cash conversion, as we traditionally do. And we have very also clear building blocks to be able to get there from a cash conversion cycle perspective as we become a fully, fully independent company and operate in a consumer environment with the right payables, with the right inventories, with the right receivables and because we have two building blocks to get there. So, overall, line of sight to that cash conversion after a period of investment, which is the right thing to do. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Thibaut Mongon for concluding comments. Thibaut Mongon : So, thank you all for joining us today. We hope that this call gave you some color on our outlook for 2025. And as I said earlier, we enter 2025 very confident in our ability to deliver on our outlook, with the compounding impact of the transformation we led in 2024 and the strength of the plans we have for 2025. So, with that, we thank you for joining us today, and we will talk soon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
