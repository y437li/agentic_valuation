This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Wal-Mart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. [Operator Instructions].  This call will contain statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley's remarks in this call. Carol Schumacher : Hi, this is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Our press release and full transcript of this call are available on our website, www.stock.walmart.com.  Here's today' s agenda : Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will provide his thoughts about the quarter and some of his thoughts about his recent interactions with our customers. Jeff Davis, EVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. Then, we'll go to the operating segments. Bill Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. first; then Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International; and then Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club will round out that section. Charles Holley, Wal-Mart's CFO will discuss our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns and he'll also provide Q2 guidance.  A quick reminder about our guidance conventions : We update our full year EPS guidance only when we release Q2 earnings, so you'll hear that information in August, not today. Today, we will provide you Q2 guidance for both EPS and our U.S. segment comps. Let me also remind you about our comp sales calendar. Our comp week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. During fiscal 2014, we will report comp store sales on a 53-week basis with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. Because we didn't observe the 53-week retail calendar last year, our comp calendar for Q1 began on Saturday, January 26 and ended on Friday, April 26, 2013. Last year also included an extra day for leap year, so this year's fiscal calendar for Q1 includes 1 less day. Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Wal-Mart including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate are available on our website. Please note that this year, we no longer have discontinued operations, but we do have one new term we'd like you to make note of : corporate and support is now what we call our corporate areas, including core corporate, such as finance and legal, as well as Global eCommerce and global leverage services. Previously, we referred to this as other unallocated. Our Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held at 7 :00 a.m. Central Time on Friday, June 7, at the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. The meeting also is available via webcast through our website. Again, that's stock.walmart.com or via Wal-Mart's free IR app. So now let's get on to the results, Mike. Mike Duke : Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Wal-Mart grew first quarter diluted earnings per share 4.6% to $1.14. In a quarter marked by considerable headwinds to top line sales, we delivered solid EPS growth. Frankly, we had a more difficult quarter than expected when we announced our guidance in February. It's important to note that Wal-Mart U.S. continued to gain market share across several key categories. Sales were pressured primarily by delayed tax refunds, which caused customers to put off discretionary purchases. And though no one likes to talk about weather, it was a real factor across the United States. In fact, right here in Northwest Arkansas, we had the latest snowfall in the history of Arkansas reporting. I'm pleased that Bill and his team managed through these headwinds to deliver almost $67 billion in sales and leverage. This disciplined expense management allowed Wal-Mart U.S. to deliver solid operating profit despite the pressure on sales. I share Bill's optimism about the remainder of the year and I believe the underlying strength of the Wal-Mart U.S. business will deliver positive comps next quarter.  Now let me share some additional key metrics for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 1.8% to $114.2 billion, which excluded $1 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat and we are committed to achieving leverage for the full year. We are proud that our U.S. operating segments leveraged operating expenses. We generated $6.5 billion of consolidated operating income, an increase of 1.1%. As you know, I like to visit customers in their local markets around the world. I recently traveled to stores throughout South America and the U.S. It's gratifying to see how important EDLP is for our customers. Our mission is simple and focused : to help people save money so they can live better. When we simplify and focus our execution against this mission, it's easy for our associates to prioritize what they have to do. Listening to our customers ensures we deliver the merchandise they want and the experience they expect. We also evaluate how our daily decisions support our EDLC and EDLP priorities. This is our opportunity to get even better at being Wal-Mart. Our customers also remind me how they are integrating technology into their shopping locations. Our goal is to make their shopping experience seamless and we have fantastic talent, delivering a number of innovative solutions to enhance your experience. When I recently visited our eCommerce teams in San Bruno, California and in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I witnessed the tremendous quality of talent in our eCommerce organization. I have no doubt that we are making the right investments in this space to differentiate ourselves and become a better Wal-Mart. And with eCommerce sales growing more than 30% in the first quarter versus last year, these investments are paying off. Turning now to Sam's Club. Sam's delivered a positive comp for the first quarter. You'll hear more from Roz about our nationwide membership fee increase rollout that was announced yesterday and how Sam's is also driving member value through improved merchandise assortment and in-club marketing. Wal-Mart International's constant currency sales expanded 5.4%, while on a reported basis net sales were up 2.9%. We grew market share in a number of our markets despite headwinds from difficult economic conditions across several markets and weather. Online sales in the U.K. and Brazil were strong. Our focus remains on bringing Wal-Mart's low prices to customers in all of our markets and the transition to EDLP continues in key markets like Brazil and China. We are, however, disappointed in our expense control in international. As you know, we have put a lot of emphasis on the importance of leveraging expenses as a company, and Doug and his team are taking actions in each country to improve our cost management and expand on a number of productivity initiatives. I'm pleased that, overall, Wal-Mart International made progress on managing inventory this quarter. Across our segments, improving new store productivity is a priority. We have a more diligent process for reviewing grand opening performance and we're taking immediate actions to strengthen sales where they're needed. And as we discussed last year, we slowed the pace of store openings within selected international markets. Our corporate and support cost increased this quarter due to investments in leverage initiatives and Global eCommerce support, as well as higher compliance related expenses. Jeff and Charles will provide more details on the financials behind these investments. In the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our compliance programs around the world. We're working closely with third-party anticorruption compliance experts to review and to assess the programs in our international markets and to partner with us on anticorruption support and training. Beyond anticorruption, our comprehensive global compliance review continues in all of our markets to evaluate and reinforce our procedures and our programs applicable to 14 compliance areas, including license and permits, food safety and ethical sourcing, among others.  Wal-Mart continues to make strides on the issues that matter to our customers. I was honored to stand with First Lady Michelle Obama recently to pledge Wal-Mart's support of the joining forces initiative to benefit our U.S. Military veterans and their families. On Memorial Day, we will begin a program to hire recent honorably discharged U.S. veterans. We're proud of this initiative and appreciate the partnership of other large companies that are joining us in providing employment opportunities to these worthy Americans. As I close my remarks, I'd like to reiterate that I'm confident about our long-term strategy and the direction that Wal-Mart is headed. We didn't have the first quarter performance we wanted as a company due partly to various external factors and also the comparison to last year's great first quarter. You'll hear the specifics about why we feel better about our U.S. business' performance for the second quarter. This, coupled with more discipline in international and our investments in strategic initiatives, will allow was to improve our performance throughout the year. Our commitment to Wal-Mart's mission to save people money so that they can live better, benefits our customers and our shareholders alike. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff? Jeffrey Davis : Thank you, Mike. As you just heard, Wal-Mart reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.14 versus $1.09 last year. Recall last year-end, we stated the company's continued investment in eCommerce initiatives would negatively impact our fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share by an incremental $0.09. Consequently, our first quarter results were unfavorably impacted by these initiatives by approximately $0.02. Consolidated net sales increased 1% to $113.4 billion. I would like to remind you that the first quarter of last year included an extra day due to leap year and added approximately 100 basis points to net sales. Separately, first quarter net sales included $200 million from an acquisition and were also impacted by more than $1 billion of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Therefore, on a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 1.8% to $114.2 billion. With respect to comp sales for the quarter, total U.S. comp sales without fuel decreased 1.2%. Bill and Roz will provide more details in a minute. Membership and other income increased 1.6% compared to the first quarter last year. Please stay tuned to hear more from Roz regarding our recent advancements in club membership. Total revenue for the first quarter was $114.2 billion, a 1% increase over last year. This was on top of a strong 8.5% increase at this time, last year. Gross profit increased 1.2%, primarily driven by supply chain productivity and merchandise mix within our U.S. business segments. The gross profit rate was relatively flat to last year.  Now turning to expenses. Our operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 19.1%, which is relatively flat to last year. As you heard from Mike, our U.S. businesses leveraged operating expenses for the quarter. And you will hear more from Doug on the international teams' focus to reduce expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year.  Now let's take a closer look at corporate and support expenses. Corporate and support is comprised of : core corporate, Global eCommerce support and global leveraged services. Total corporate and support expenses increased approximately $200 million or 44.4%. Our core corporate expenses increased 37.2%, including $73 million in expenses related to FCPA matters, which was above our forecasted range of $40 million to $45 million.  Approximately $44 million of the expenses represent cost incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while $29 million covers costs regarding the global compliance review, program enhancements and organizational changes. Excluding the FCPA matters, core corporate increased by approximately 14.6%. The remainder of the corporate and support growth is primarily associated with global leveraged services. This increase is the result of investments to enhance enterprise information management, build global capabilities and leverage scale. Though we will continue to invest in these areas, we expect these expenses to moderate for the remainder of the fiscal year.  This leads us to consolidated operating income, which grew 1.1% to $6.5 billion, slightly ahead of sales growth. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased 0.9% to $530 million, as we continue to avail ourselves of low interest rate funding. And consolidated net income attributable to Wal-Mart increased 1.1% to $3.8 billion. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was 33.4%, essentially unchanged from the first quarter of last year. Full year guidance for fiscal 2014 effective tax rate continues to be between 32% and 33%. As a reminder, our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Now turning to our balance sheet. Consolidated inventory increased 4.5%, primarily driven by our U.S. operations. You'll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding the individual drivers of inventory growth. Payables, as a percentage of inventory, was 85.2%, which compares to 89.8% last year. This decrease was primarily the result of increased levels of inventory within our U.S. segments and the timing of disbursements. Our debt-to-total capitalization was 44.8% at the end of the quarter compared to 44.2% last year. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow versus $3.1 billion last year. An increase in income tax payments due primarily to changes in federal bonus depreciation rules and an increase in capital expenditures contributed to the free cash flow decline. Moving on to returns. For the quarter, the company returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 30 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. As of April 30, we have approximately $1.5 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization. To wrap up, return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2013, was 17.8% compared to 18.1% last year. This reduction was primarily the result of acquisitions and an increase in fixed assets within our base business. Now let's turn it over to the operating segments. We'll start with Wal-Mart U.S. Bill? William Simon : Thank you, Jeff. When we last spoke to you in February, we shared that the first quarter had gotten off to a very slow start, essentially due to the delay in income tax refund checks. When we provided flat comp guidance for the first quarter, we had expected, among other things, to recover a reasonable portion of these tax refunds and had also assumed that customers would follow historical spending patterns with these funds. This did not materialize as we had anticipated.  Similar to what you've heard from companies in various industries that have reported earnings, top line revenue was challenged by a number of issues. These included a $9 billion reduction in IRS estimated tax refunds versus last year, and we cashed less in income tax refunds in the prior year. Additionally, the 2% increase in payroll taxes reduced inflation and some of the most unfavorable spring weather we've seen in recent years across much of the country impacted our business.  While we don't generally like talking about weather, it certainly had an impact. Weather-sensitive departments like outdoor living, sporting goods, air movement and apparel were challenged, particularly from mid-March to mid-April when weather was much less favorable than last year. However, there were bright spots where weather was fairly normal in Florida, for example, we had positive comps for the quarter. In addition, as we gave guidance last quarter, we expected an increase in the level of grocery inflation, but it did not materialize in a meaningful way. We experienced very modest inflation, much lower than last year. And in fact, we had some deflation in areas like dry grocery. We estimate that the factors discussed earlier affected our comp sales by as much as 200 basis points in the first quarter versus our expectations. Primarily driven by these factors, we ended the quarter with a lower comp than expected at a negative 1.4% compared to a strong positive 2.6% comp last year. Traffic was down 1.8%, while ticket was up 0.4%. However, excluding the first 2 weeks of the quarter, comp sales were relatively flat and traffic improved.  Despite sales being lower than expected, I'm really proud of the work done by all of our associates during the quarter. The team did an excellent job managing the business, taking care of our customers and bringing in a solid profit result, with an operating income increasing 5.9%. We also continued to gain market share across several categories. According to the Nielsen Company, we gained 20 basis points of market share in the measured category of food, consumables and health and wellness, OTC during the 13 weeks ending April 27, 2013. As of now, we're encouraged by the start of sales in the second quarter because we've seen more normalized weather and we're getting past the main effects of the reduced tax refunds. Now let's cover the financial details of the first quarter. Net sales were up $220 million or 0.3% to $66.6 billion. Last year's leap day added approximately 100 basis points of net sales to first quarter fiscal '13. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $18.2 billion, with the gross profit rate increasing 10 basis points from the previous year, partly driven by supply chain productivity and cost of goods savings initiatives. We continue to leverage these initiatives targeting specific areas of our grocery business, providing savings to our customers in the first quarter. These actions, along with our ability to leverage expenses, enabled us to further strengthen our position as the price leader in the market. Our commitment to the productivity loop is a long-term, sustainable strategy. While we'll continue to be strategic about price investments, monitoring competitor price gaps, market share and other data to ensure we maintain an appropriate balance between price investments and margin. Our strategy is based on an everyday low cost structure. For the quarter, the team did a good job managing expenses, contributing 32 basis points of expense leverage. Although a large part of the leverage was driven by a decline in incentive expense versus historically high levels last year, every part of the organization was focused on operating for less, from our distribution centers and transportation fleet, to each one of our stores. Together, we reduced expenses by 1.3% versus last year, driving a 5.9% increase in operating income. For the quarter, inventory was up 4.6% driven partly by an expanded assortment in some merchandise areas in addition to challenging weather, which created headwinds for some seasonal categories. We feel good about our current inventory position, as the weather improves and customers get ready for summer. Before I discuss the performance of our merchandising areas, I'd like to spend some time covering a few things we're doing from an operational perspective that helped drive our quarterly performance. Our logistics team continues to be a key contributor to our results by generating savings that benefit our leverage goals and gross margin. In the first quarter, the team continued to improve processes within our supply chain. This enabled us to transport 3.1% additional cases per mile driven, helping us to reduce the overall cost per cases shipped versus last year. Our result and logistics quarter after quarter are proof that our strategy is sustainable. Within our stores, we continued to fine-tune our technology investments, including self-service checkouts and work assignment tools like My Guide. These initiatives drove another quarter of solid gains and productivity, as our management teams work towards continuous improvement. We continue to expand our self-service checkouts in the first quarter, with about 38% more stores and service versus last year. In general, customer response has been positive, with utilization across the chain up over 300 basis points year-over-year. In the back rooms, projects just like My Guide and OneTouch also enabled improvements in stocker productivity by helping to facilitate the process of moving merchandise from the truck to the shelf and prioritizing work for our associates. In the first quarter, these initiatives contributed to an increase of over 3% in cases handled per work hour. We're focused on driving productivity by implementing initiatives that make work simpler for our associates and enhance our customer experience. As you might expect from Wal-Mart, there are a number of metrics be monitor to ensure strong operational execution, including customer line lengths, customer experience scores and merchandise in stock levels. While we always strive to improve, we're pleased overall with our current performance against these metrics. Now let's revenue the performance of the various merchandising areas. Grocery, which includes food and consumables, generated a low-single digit positive comp on relatively flat inflation, a much lower inflation rate than last year. In food, we've made great progress in the quality of our fresh departments and I'm particularly excited about the momentum in the produce area. We've improved our process for handling and culling produce, allowing us to get the freshest assortment in front of our customers. In the first quarter, we started to see the positive results evidenced by mid-single digit positive comps in produce and market share gains for the 13 weeks ended on March 30, according to Nielsen. In consumables, we also continued to gain market share across most departments and I'm particularly encouraged to see customers respond to our Price investment strategy, evidenced by the Nielsen data that shows noticeably higher market share gains in areas where we invested in price in the first quarter. Overall, our performance in consumables was mostly driven by the everyday need categories. Health and wellness generated low-single digit negative comp. While units were up, we experienced the largest branded generic impact to date coupled with an overall increase in generic versus brand sales. While our Rx business was pressured by the brand to generic impact, we continue to see strength in OTC, with solid comp sales and market share gains according to Nielsen. Also noteworthy is our performance in the core nonseasonal categories, like vitamins, analgesics and antacids, which delivered a mid-single digit positive comp for the quarter. Hardlines, which includes our seasonal business, posted a low-single digit negative comp. Weather significantly impacted sporting-goods categories like fishing and camping in the first quarter, with non-weather impacted categories like stationery and crafts delivering positive comps. Stationery and crafts was driven by strong growth in needle craft, paints and other indoor categories. Our new assortment is resonating with the customer evidenced by our gains in market share across several of our stationary categories for the 3-month period ending April 6, according to the NPD Group. Comps in our seasonal business were also positive, driven by solid growth in Valentine's Day and Easter, with strong results in gifts, d\u00e9cor and party wear. We continue to be a destination for the holidays providing our customers with one-stop shop solutions to stock up for the big events of the year.  Entertainment including toys had mid-single digit negative comp. Softer discretionary spending impacted entertainment and created even more significant headwinds for higher ticket electronics like TVs. On the other hand, our Wireless business again delivered a double-digit positive comp, with Straight Talk sales hitting a record high in the first quarter. Let me remind you how we're reporting sales of wireless. Reporting convention calls for sales of Straight Talk and third party gift cards such as iTunes and restaurant cards to be included in sales net of the product cost. In other words, we only account for a commission on sales. We continue to make great strides for our customers in the wireless space, providing a broad selection of affordable solutions. According to NPD, Wal-Mart became the #1 retailer in handset unit share for the 3 months ending March 31, 2013. In toys, similar to the rest of the business, we experienced softness in outdoor categories like spring toys and bicycles, which was partly offset by strength in educational and preschool toys. Apparel reported a low-single digit negative comp for the quarter, mostly driven by soft demand for spring categories. I'm pleased with the work of the team in apparel and particularly encouraged by the performance of our basics offering, which delivered a low-single digit positive comp. Kids and accessories were also positive in the first quarter benefiting from assortment improvements. We've made great progress in this area and will continue to focus on quality throughout the year to drive results. In home, pronounced softness in outdoor living impacted the performance, driving the business to a mid-single digit negative comp. Our results were significantly better in areas of the country less impacted by weather. In the Pacific division, for instance, Outdoor Living delivered a high single-digit positive comp in the first quarter. In indoor living categories, we continued to work on assortment making national brands like Rachael Ray affordable for our customers in delivering a low-single digit positive comp in cooking and dining. Our customers are shopping our home aisles evidenced by our gains in market share across the business according to NPD. Other areas of the business where we're gaining momentum are Walmart.com and mobile. We continue to drive integration with our stores to deliver a seamless customer experience. In the first quarter, we continued to test the mobile self-checkout option Scan & Go, expanding it across more than 200 stores in 14 different regions. We're encouraged by the early results, with the majority of Scan & Go customers using the feature multiple times. The team is constantly making improvements and will soon be testing digital coupons and gift cards with Scan & Go. We also announced we'll be testing self-service lockers in select stores this summer. The goal of the program is to reduce the wait time for site to store orders, providing customers with an anywhere, anytime pick-up solution. We're also very excited about the opportunity to grow the ship-from-store program. You've heard us talk about the power of our physical footprint and how we plan to utilize our presence across the country as an additional asset in our fulfillment network. We're pleased with the initial results and are currently shipping certain orders from 35 stores straight to customer's homes. We expanded the pilot considerably in the first quarter and we'll continue to expand strategically throughout the rest of the year. Our eCommerce strategy complements a growing real estate portfolio. We're in a unique position to serve our customers whenever and wherever they want to shop, integrating our Walmart.com capabilities with an expanding presence of Supercenters in small formats. In the first quarter, we added 38 new units and converted 8 units to Supercenters through relocation or expansion. These 46 units added 3.6 million incremental square feet and included 1 discount store, 24 Supercenters and 21 small formats, most of which were Neighborhood Markets.  Neighborhood Markets continued their positive performance, delivering a low-single digit positive comp, primarily driven by solid traffic gains. The vast majority of Neighborhood Markets include pharmacies, providing an additional convenience for our customers and driving traffic to the store. Our optimized assortment and convenient shopping experience is resonating with the customer, evidenced by our positive comps across most of the merchandising areas.  Wal-Mart Express also continues to generate strong results, delivering another quarter of double-digit positive comps. In the second quarter, we'll begin testing various supply chain initiatives as part of the North Carolina density test, which will strengthen our understanding of supply chain strategies for smaller stores. During the second quarter, we're planning to open between 60 and 65 new units, including new stores, expansions and relocations. Our second quarter forecast represents about 4 million square feet of retail space, which will put us well on our way to deliver our previous guidance of 15 million to 17 million square feet of retail growth in fiscal year '14. This year started with many challenges for our core customer. Nevertheless, I'm confident in our position and in the ability of our teams to execute. We believe that our strategy works under any economic environment and our underlying business remains strong. From an operational perspective, we will continue fueling the productivity loop, improving every aspect of our operation so we can leverage expenses, invest in price and drive results. Our price investments will be supported by a solid marketing program that will communicate our strong price leadership. Throughout the rest of the year, we'll continue expanding our local basket challenge campaign through TV and radio, covering 70% of our markets across the country. Most important, we'll continue to run our business with our customers, our associates and our communities in mind. Earlier this year, we announced our veterans initiative with the objective of hiring any honorably discharged veteran seeking employment within his or her first 12 months off active duty. On Memorial Day, we'll be ready to launch the program and we believe the vast majority of applicants will be placed within 30 days. May is off to a good start, with positive comps. We continue to feel good about the underlying business, as evidenced by first quarter results in areas less impacted by weather, as well as by our market share gains. We'll continue to monitor the impact of the 2% payroll tax increase along with other factors like fuel prices. Based on these factors, we forecast comp sales to increase in the range of flat to positive 2% in the 13-week period from April 27 through July 26, 2013. Now I'll turn it over to Doug for an international update. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thank you, Bill. I'd like to start the update on international by reminding you of our priorities, balancing growth and returns. As you know, Wal-Mart International is an important contributor to topline growth. During the first quarter, we delivered a respectable top line. We feel good about the net and comp sales, especially given last year's really strong first quarter, the loss of leap day and weather issues. As a reminder, our first quarter last year was our strongest of FY '13, with international net sales on a reported basis up 15% and operating income up 21.2%. During this year's first quarter, on a reported basis, Wal-Mart International grew net sales 2.9% to $33 billion. On a constant currency basis, Wal-Mart International's first quarter sales were $33.8 billion, up 5.4%, a stronger dollar against key currencies impacted international results more negatively than expected and decreased the top line by $1 billion. Our acquisition increased sales by $200 million. Our stores in the U.K., Africa, Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, China and India delivered positive comp store sales. Comp sales declined in Canada and Japan. As mentioned, last year had an extra leap day for leap year and the comparison to last year impacted sales and customer traffic by about 100 basis points. From a relative performance point of view, we were encouraged with our market share gains around the world during the quarter. We grew our share in Canada, Africa, Chile, Argentina, Central America, China and Japan. We maintained market share in the U.K. and Mexico. And although we did not grow overall share in Brazil, we did increase share in food and consumables. Like revenue growth, another important priority is improving our returns. We were disappointed with our operating income performance this quarter, which impacted returns. In fact, we had a decline in profitability versus last year. This was partially due to having 1 less day of sales in all markets, as well as specific drivers that I'll elaborate on as I review the markets.  Operating income was $1.3 billion and decreased 4.7% on a reported basis versus last year. On a constant currency basis, operating income declined 2.4%. Our gross profit rate was slightly down and operating expenses grew faster than sales. Several factors contributed to us not leveraging expenses : softer sales, wage inflation, higher indirect taxes and strategic investments including those in eCommerce. These are investments beyond those covered in the corporate and support budget. Unfortunately, in the international markets, we have less workforce flexibility than in the U.S. In many markets, it takes more time to introduce and implement productivity improvements that help us to adjust wages to sales realities. Given our current headwinds, I expect second quarter expenses to remain under pressure. Let me assure you that all management teams are focused on reducing expenses throughout our operating segment, and we expect to demonstrate improvement in the second half of the year. Another priority has been inventory management. I'm pleased to say we've seen some improvement in this quarter that was aided by Easter being 1 week earlier for the markets that celebrate the holiday. Constant currency inventory increased 7.1% over last year, an improvement from the first quarter last year. On a reported basis, inventory was up only 3.6%. Now let's get into the results for our larger markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis and unless otherwise stated total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal calendar basis. Let's begin with EMEA. The U.K. had a solid first quarter in a challenging market. Personal income grew much lower than the cost of essential items, putting pressure on all consumers. According to Kantar Worldpanel, the market experienced stronger growth in the first quarter than in previous quarters, driven solely by inflation, while market volumes declined. The U.K. market as a whole experienced significant supply integrity issues within the quarter related to meat, ASDA responded by carrying out robust and rigorous testing and continues to focus on transparency for customers. In the first quarter, ASDA's net sales rose 2.6% and sales excluding fuel increased 3%. Comparable sales rose by 1.3%, excluding fuel, growing ahead of the market. Average comp ticket increased by 1.6%, while comp traffic decreased by 0.3%. As this market share was flat at 17.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 17, the latest data reported by Kantar's Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll. A bright spot continues to be ASDA's online grocery sales, which grew more than 16%. During the quarter, ASDA increased investment and reducing the price of key food essentials. As a result, ASDA's internal inflation measures continued to be significantly below the market and comparable food volumes were positive in the first quarter. Reinforcing this strategy, ASDA also won the Grocer 33 lowest-priced supermarket for 12 of the 13 weeks in Q1. Strong price and value gaps, combined with events such as Valentine's Day, Easter and Mom's day, drove food sales growth, with Easter categories such as lamb, salmon and bakery significantly outperforming. A January clearance event and seasonably appropriate weather drove strong general merchandise sales. ASDA's gross profit margin declined slightly in the quarter driven by sales mix and price investment. Considering the impact of fuel sales, operating expenses grew slower than sales. The We Operate For Less program continued to deliver savings, offsetting some of the cost headwinds across energy, property taxes, insurance and environmental tariffs, along with some weather-related costs. Operating income decreased by 0.8% from the prior year.  Moving to Canada. Wal-Mart Canada faced a challenging quarter, as consumer spending weakened due to higher household debt levels. Our results were impacted by the unseasonably colder weather this year, versus unseasonably warm weather last year and the leap year overlap. Net sales grew 6.1%, but Canada had a decline in operating income and did not leverage expenses. Comparable sales decreased 1.3%, with comp ticket up 0.7% and comp traffic declining 2%. We had strong comp sales in food, consumables and home lines, but continue to see softer sales in entertainment. The colder weather also impacted sales and hard lines and apparel. However, in the first quarter's challenging environment, we drove market share gains of 120 basis points in the Nielsen Company measured categories of food, consumables and health and wellness. Regarding profitability, gross profit rate increased due to improved initial margins from private label and direct important gains, as well as reduced shrink. However, operating expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to negative comp store sales, the lapping of costs related to the year-over-year growth in new store base and investments in eCommerce.  Moving to Sub-Saharan Africa. As you know, Massmart is a publicly held company in South Africa and only announces results every 6 months. For the 14 weeks ending March 31, Massmart increased sales by 10.3% and comparable sales by 6%. While these are good numbers, the trends are slower than we reported for Massmart at the close of fiscal 2013. The South African consumer environment remains cautious and sales growth is forecasted to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. Also note that Massmart will hold its annual meeting on May 22.  Now to Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different from Walmex-reported numbers. Walmex results for the first quarter were mixed. We had solid results in Central America and disappointing performance in Mexico that impacted the overall business. For the quarter, net sales grew 5.5%. Gross margin increased 60 basis points versus last year driven by improvements in both Mexico and Central America. Operating expenses grew more than sales. Management is focused on reducing expenses and increasing productivity savings. Operating income for the quarter grew 7.5%, faster than sales, primarily due to strong gross profit margins. For the first quarter, Mexico's sales increased 5.6% over last year and comparable store sales grew 1.1%. Average comp ticket in Mexico increased 4.4% and comp traffic decreased 3.3% over last year. Traffic was negative due to calendar effects and a general market slowdown in consumption. In relation to the market, we maintained market share on total sales, but Mexico's first quarter comp store sales for the self-service formats grew 0.8%. This was slower than ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, at 1.4%.  In Mexico, gross margin was up 48 basis points. Expenses grew 8.8%, above our sales growth. The biggest increases in expenses were in physical infrastructure investments like maintenance, repairs and depreciation. Operating income grew 5.5%. Central America is on track to deliver good results. Systems integration will conclude as expected in the second quarter and markets that were lagging, like Guatemala, are improving. Central America increased net sales from the previous year by 4.9%. Comparable store sales increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin increased 124 basis points versus last year as a result of better merchandising and EDLP execution. The transition to EDLP in our Central American countries is completed. Expenses grew more than sales. Operating income increased 40%. Moving on to Brazil. Brazil grew sales in the first quarter and had a slight operating profit. We continue our mantra of EDLC and EDLP, maintaining a 7% price gap in self-service formats, and we're pleased that we're gaining traction with customers. First quarter retail sales in Brazil grew 5.5% from last year with comparable sales growing 3.7%. Ticket grew 7.2%, and comp traffic declined 3.5% when compared to last year. There was strong performance in consumables, food and perishables as we gained market share in these categories. Sales of general merchandise were weak as we scaled down interest-free credit offerings. Gross profit rate increased slightly as a result of lower shrink and better markdown management, but we did not leverage operating expenses in Brazil due to our lower rate of comp store growth specifically in our wholesale formats and wage inflation. Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release first quarter earnings on May 30. Moving to Asia. Walmart China grew sales and operating income during the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter grew 5.4% over last year despite a weaker than expected Chinese New Year. Comparable store sales growth was 1%. As more Chinese families own a car and other amenities for their home, there is much greater trip consolidation. Comp ticket grew 8.9% in China, but traffic declined 7.9%. Traffic declines are consistent with the overall market. First quarter gross profit rate was slightly down from last year due to our investment in price. However, Walmart China leveraged operating expenses even with wage inflation. In China, we are near the end of our planning stage of our EDLP transition and have started to take a few steps. As in other markets, this is a multiyear effort, and we know it'll take time for our customers to see and appreciate the value brought to them by EDLP. On to Japan, where the economy continues to slow. Walmart Japan's net sales and comp sales decreased 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively, reflecting cautious consumer behavior. First quarter comp traffic decreased 1.9% and ticket decreased 0.4%. Traffic decreased due to an increase in competition in the convenience-related formats. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the first quarter declined by 3.3% from last year. So on a positive note, we outperformed the market. Walmart Japan's gross profit rate decreased by 96 basis points due to our increased investment in lower prices. Walmart Japan missed leveraging expenses by a slight margin due to the sales decline, but year-over-year operating expenses were down even with higher remodeling costs. Accordingly, Walmart Japan had a slight operating loss this quarter compared to positive operating income in the prior year. Turning to the opportunities in eCommerce. We are excited about the global capabilities we are strengthening and expanding in the key markets of the U.K., Brazil and China. ASDA's continued focus on offering a convenient shopping experience for customers drove strong online sales in the first part of 2013. During Q1, ASDA completed the rollout of Wi-Fi across our stores to enable a better smart device shopping experience. In addition, our ASDA team added its grocery Click & Collect offer in approximately 100 stores. ASDA also significantly expanded grocery home shopping capacity by opening a third dedicated online fulfillment center in Nottingham, providing increased accuracy, efficiency and delivery options. Customers can now tap into 20,000 additional delivery slots per week. Over the last 6 months, in Brazil, our Walmart.com.br site has become the largest traffic eCommerce site. For the first quarter, online sales in Brazil increased over 40%. In the previous year acquisition of Yihaodian, one of the fastest-growing eCommerce businesses in China, we now have a platform to compete in a market with broadband penetration that has exceeded the U.S. Yihaodian provides consumer goods on a same-day basis in Tier 1 cities, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. We grew market share already this year in eCommerce in the U.K., Brazil and China, and the integration of technology into our business is a key for future growth. We will expand our successes and learnings from the U.K., Brazil and China into other markets such as Mexico, Japan and Canada. We are also focused on building a world-class compliance program across the globe. Our comprehensive program spans 14 different compliance dimensions that address areas from ethical sourcing to licenses and permits. We are strengthening what already existed in each market, adding subject matter expertise, significant investments in talent, process, systems and training. For example, we recently announced a $16.2 million, 3-year investment in food safety in China. We are reinforcing Walmart culture based on our basic beliefs of respect for the individual, strive for excellence, service to the customer and as always, on a foundation of integrity. With our compliance program, we will operate more effectively in each market, and we are building a solid foundation for future growth.  In closing, it's been a tough start to the beginning of the year, but we're focused in each of our markets and have tighter discipline in our execution. As Mike said earlier, we are simplifying, we are focused and we are prioritizing. With our current outlook, we do not expect to leverage expenses in the second quarter, but we've begun to take actions that will demonstrate improvement as we progress through the year. For example, we're working hard to accelerate the improvements that we will receive from working with our global business process group. With that, we remain focused on the core tenets of our operating model and being the best Walmart we can be. Our global consumer is challenged with their household budgets, and we need to continue to provide them with the price and value they need. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks, Doug. This year, Sam's Club celebrates our 30 year anniversary. It's been an exciting journey ever since our first club opened in Midwest City, Oklahoma in 1983. I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our associates over the past 30 years who've delivered tremendous value to our members and made our business so successful. During the first quarter, we grew net sales, and comp sales were within guidance. We grew membership income by delivering superior value, responding to business member trends and enhancing our membership offering. Combined with reduced operating expenses, we generated operating profits more than 7% ahead of last year. Comp sales, without fuel, were up 0.2% for the 13-week period, lapping a 5.3% comp sales increase last year. Comp traffic was up 1.3% driven by our Advantage members, and ticket was down 1.1% driven by Business members. Unfavorable weather this year created a headwind in our weather-sensitive categories. In geographies with more moderate weather, such as the West, members responded positively to our seasonal merchandise, indicating sales in these categories improved as the weather changes. Additionally, inflation continued to moderate from Q4, impacting our top line results as inflation this quarter was approximately 50 basis points. Inflation ran between 250 and 300 basis points in the first quarter last year. Our business member is an integral part of our business, and comp sales and traffic patterns continue to indicate that they remain pressured. Small business optimism remains at historically low levels as businesses adapt to higher payroll taxes and cautious consumers. In response, we're focused on increasing awareness of the value Sam's Club offers. We're executing regional business expos and small business appreciation programs in May and June, in which our associates spend time working with members in their place of business. Despite these headwinds I mentioned in the first quarter, we drove sales and profit growth. Net sales, including fuel, were $13.9 billion, up 0.1%. Fuel created a 40 basis point headwind to sales growth as fuel prices were down 3.8% compared to last year. Gallons sold were up 1.3%. Gross profit rate was up 7 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved slightly. Operating income increased 7.4% to $525 million. Fuel is an important component of our strategy to provide more value to our members. Volatility in fuel prices, however, can notably impact our financial results. The remainder of our discussion, therefore, will be focused on the core business and exclude fuel for comparative purposes.  Net sales for the quarter were $12.2 billion, up 0.5% from last year. During the first quarter last year, we gained 1 additional day due to leap year, resulting in 1 less day this year. The addition of leap day last year provided a benefit of about 100 basis points. Our strongest divisional performance was in the West, with our strongest regional performance in the Mountain, mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions. Now let's move on to merchandising highlights for the quarter. Fresh comp sales were up low single-digits, with strength in dairy and produce. Members responded positively to our new pack-size innovation in certain frozen food items. These items contain smaller bags within the main pack, increasing convenience for our members. Grocery and beverage sales grew low single-digits driven by growth in dry grocery, partially offset by declines in our beverage business due to both weather and Business member softness. Sales of consumables posted a low single-digit comp. With the support of our strategic price investments, we delivered low- to mid-single digit unit growth in areas like paper and tabletop. Our baby category continues to be a strong source of growth with market share, according to Nielsen, growing by 20 basis points for the 13-week period ending April 27, 2013. Technology and entertainment posted a negative low single-digit comp. Pressures in office electronics and media were partially offset by compelling value in wireless, which posted double-digit comp and unit growth. According to the NPD Group, we gained market share in TVs for the 13-week period ending April 27, 2013. Sales in apparel and home were down low single-digits. Home saw modest gains driven by domestics and mattresses. Apparel was down due to seasonal merchandise, but our core basic apparel business posted mid single-digit comps, indicating strength in our underlying business. Jewelry, where we have strengthened our assortment and our price points, gained momentum throughout the quarter. Member responded very well to our improved selection of high-quality diamonds. Health and wellness including pharmacy experienced low single-digit comps. Over-the-counter merchandise continues to grow, especially diet products. We filled more prescriptions, but sales declined as the industry shifts more to generics. The majority of our prescription business remains maintenance related, generating regular traffic to our health and wellness area. We continue to increase awareness of the services available at Sam's Club, such as pharmacist provided immunizations and health screening programs.  During the quarter, we increased the number of health screenings by almost 30% over the same period last year. Sales of ancillary categories negatively affected the quarter due to a decline in tobacco sales, driven by softness from our convenience store members as they see increased competition from dollar stores. Moving to online. Innovation and collaboration with our Global eCommerce team resulted in double-digit sales growth for the quarter, driven by categories like portable electronics, baby and mattresses. These categories were not only strong online but also in our clubs, demonstrating that our members are finding great values no matter what channel they shop. Gross profit rate remained relatively flat as continued strategic price investments were offset by a more favorable mix due to softer sales and lower margin categories like tobacco and beverages.  Strong membership growth is critical to remaining a healthy club business, and we're focused on innovative ways to reach new prospects. We collaborated with LivingSocial from March 4 through the 6 to reach new Sam's Club members. The offer included a base membership, $20 gift card and a merchandise package that included a variety of take home meal solutions, all for $45, a total value of roughly $80. In just 48 hours, we had more than 157,000 people sign up for this offer, and we were pleased with the significant social media buzz and deal share volume generated.  Net membership income grew 2.4%, driven by Advantage member growth offsetting slight declines from Business members. Membership and other income was up 6.5% versus last year because of improved contract terms relating to our profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 12 basis points. A driver of this leverage was a decline in incentive expenses versus last year. Looking at the bottom line, first quarter operating income was $519 million, a 6.6% increase over last year. Inventory, including fuel, was up 6% year-over-year as softer sales significantly affected our sell-through rate across several areas. Our management team is focused on actively slowing the rate of inventory growth to better align with the rate of sales. We continue to focus on creating member value by executing our real estate strategy, enhancing the membership offering, improving item merchandising and offering members access anytime, anywhere. We are pleased with the performance of clubs opened within the last 2 to 3 years. During the quarter, we relocated 1 club in Texas City, which outperformed expectations. We plan to open 15 to 20 new and relocated clubs during the year, the majority of which we schedule for the third and fourth quarter.  Now I'd like to provide more details on our overall membership strategy. We apply key learnings from the last month of our membership pilot in Texas to enhance the value of a Sam's Club membership. The Texas pilot represents 12% of our total U.S. club base. As of yesterday, we increased our membership fee nationwide. The membership fee is now $45 for both Advantage and Business base membership, reflecting a $5 and $10 increase, respectively. The fee for our Plus membership remains $100. This is our first increase since January 2006, and we do not expect a significant impact to renewal rates or new sign-ups. We will continue to offer additional value to our members while driving strong membership income in the coming years as the full benefit of the fee increase will be recognized over the next 24 months.  Our first Instant Savings book, which is available to all members from May 15 through June 9, includes over $3,500 in savings on nearly 100 items, both in-club and through samsclub.com. Additionally, Plus members will continue to receive exclusive offers automatically loaded onto their membership card, which will now include fresh and private label items. With the exception of the Cash Rewards program for Plus members, these changes are consistent with our Texas pilot. Initial response to Cash Rewards has been positive. We will continue testing this benefit in Texas throughout the year to gain a better understanding of the longer term financial impact. You're also going to see a change in our merchandise strategy throughout the year. In the past, we've had great success treating our clubs essentially the same, but we recognize our member base varies around the country. Moving forward, members will experience exciting merchandise, heightened by local brands, all displayed with a new level of visual excitement.  We're also adapting to serve our members who are shopping online and in our clubs. Members are using their mobile devices before, during and after their shopping experience. The Sam's Club mobile app is giving our members personalized eCommerce and the ability to shop anywhere, anytime. Before visiting the club, members can build shopping lists and fill prescriptions. In the club, they can research merchandise information and compare cost. And alongside Walmart, we're piloting the Scan & Go app, which will be in 150 clubs by mid-June. Technology clearly enhances our members' shopping experience. The combination of our strategies position us well for the second quarter, and we have a number of events to drive sales. We were pleased with the first 2 weeks' start to the quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from April 27 through July 26 to range between 1% and 3%. Last year, for the 13-week period, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2%. The core business at Sam's Club is solid. We're confident that the combination of new club growth, membership improvements, exciting and locally relevant merchandise, as well as eCommerce and digital opportunities will drive momentum. We're proud of what we have accomplished in the past 30 years and are confident that we are well positioned going forward. Now I'll turn the program over to Charles for our wrap-up and guidance. Charles? Charles Holley : Thanks, Roz. To wrap up, let me provide some perspective on the quarter. First, we feel good about many aspects of our company's performance. We delivered 4.6% earnings per share growth in a tough sales environment. Both Walmart U.S and Sam's Club levered expenses and grew operating income faster than sales. We generated solid cash flows from operations. We grew our eCommerce sales more than 30% and grew market share in the U.K., Brazil and China. We issued $5 billion of fixed income debt at record low rates on the strength of our balance sheet. And in February of this year, we announced an 18% increase in our dividend. The first quarter also presented some challenges. As a company, our leverage ratio was relatively flat. And although we grew consolidated operating income faster than sales, the growth did not meet our expectations. Looking ahead, our financial priorities remain growth, leverage and returns and we usually talk about them in this order. But today, I'd like to start with a discussion on leverage. The company's leverage in the first quarter was relatively flat, and the second quarter will be challenging as well. Our largest challenges are with international, as Doug spoke about, and our leverage services area, where we are investing in projects and programs that will save costs in the long run. Operating expense leverage is a critical piece of our business model, and we remain focused on delivering the 5-year, 100 basis point goal through fiscal 2017. Though expense leverage is not expected to be achieved equally across the quarters every year, we are committed to leveraging operating expenses for this year. Early investments to expand our leverage initiatives will initially have a short-term impact on expenses. However, these investments will benefit Walmart for the long term. Our leverage teams are focused on 3 key areas : best practice implementation, building greater sourcing capabilities and back-office efficiency. Under the best practice umbrella, for example, our global business process teams continue to work on self-checkout expansion, auto replenishment systems and associate scheduling systems. Our sourcing teams are working to increase direct import volumes to deliver greater savings on cost of goods and transportation. We also continue to make progress on goods not for resale, especially in the refrigeration and energy areas. In our back office area, we completed the migration of work from 4 different finance offices in Central America to a regional center that is now serving most of our Latin American countries. Initiatives like this help us simplify, prioritize and focus. In addition, we continue to invest in our international markets through new store growth and our compliance organization. Jeff provided details earlier on the expenses related to the ongoing FCPA matters, as well as the processes we're putting in place to continue to strengthen our global compliance organization.  Now let's talk about growth. During the quarter, we added over 5 million square feet of retail space. Our total revenue growth was less than we expected, growing 1% versus last year. In addition, headwinds from currency impacted top line more than we anticipated. However, as you heard from Bill, Roz and Doug, we feel confident about our growth in the second quarter and the balance of the year. One final comment on sales. eCommerce will continue to grow in importance for our company. During the quarter, eCommerce sales increased by over 30%, and we continue to make strategic investments in the markets that offer us the greatest growth opportunity. We're focusing this investment in key areas, including our global technology platform and next-generation fulfillment networks, as well as scaling additional markets around the world. We remain focused on 4 important markets in eCommerce. From a traffic perspective, we see over 45 million visitors each month in the U.S. on Walmart.com, where growth and conversion are accelerating. In the U.K., we're the second largest online grocer while in Brazil, we were just named the #1 trafficked eCommerce site. And you've heard us talk about our investment in Yihaodian, one of the fastest growing eCommerce businesses in China. We're excited about the potential for growth in this space, and Neil Ashe has assembled the talent necessary to achieve our growth plans.  Let me finish our discussion on our financial priorities today by talking about returns. We deployed cash to grow our business and return value to shareholders. During the quarter, $3.8 billion was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Walmart has a long history of delivering great returns for our shareholders, and we remain committed to continuing this trend. Let's move on to guidance. As we think about earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, there are a couple of specific items that we've included. First, we told you during the fourth quarter last year that investments in Global eCommerce initiatives would have an incremental $0.09 impact for fiscal 2014. During the second quarter, we expect an impact of about $0.02 per share. This is in line with the $0.02 impact we had in the first quarter. Additionally, we believe costs associated with FCPA matters will be between $65 million and $70 million for the second quarter. Taking these factors into consideration, along with current business and macroeconomic trends including currency, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be between $1.22 and $1.27. Last year, Walmart delivered earnings per share of $1.18 in the second quarter. Thank you for your support of our company. Have a great day.

Mike Duke, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about the quarter and the challenging retail environment we face in all of our markets. Jeff Davis, EVP of finance and treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results. Then, we\u2019ll cover the operating segments. First up, Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. Bill will be followed by Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart International, and then we\u2019ll complete our operating segment discussion with Rosalind Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Given the level of e-commerce activity in many areas of the company, we\u2019ve invited Neil Ashe, president and CEO of Global eCommerce, to join us today for a progress report on our strategies to integrate e-commerce sales within our stores. Neil will follow the operating segment reports. Then, Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up the call with an analysis of our financial priorities, as well as EPS guidance for the third quarter and the full year. We continue to receive questions from you about our comp sales reporting calendar for this fiscal year for our U.S. operating segments. This fiscal year, we will report comp store sales on a 53-week basis, with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. As a reminder, our comp week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. Our Q4 reporting period begins Oct. 26 and runs through Jan. 31. Therefore, week 53 will be compared to week one of the current fiscal year 2014. Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Walmart, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate are available on our website. Please note that year to date, we no longer have discontinued operations. But, we do have one term we\u2019d like to remind you about. We started with this term last quarter. \u201cCorporate and support\u201d is now what we call our corporate areas, including core corporate, such as finance and legal, as well as Global eCommerce support and global leverage services. Previously, we referred to this as \u201cother unallocated.\u201d Our annual analyst meeting is Tuesday, October 15 in Northwest Arkansas. Registration is open, and we invite you to join us for a full day of presentations and updates on our global business. The meeting also is available via webcast through our website, again, that\u2019s www.stock.walmart.com, if you can\u2019t join us in person. We have a lot to cover today. Mike will start us off with the highlights and a report card on our business at the halfway mark of the year. Mike? Mike Duke : Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. Today, we reported a 5.1 percent increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.24 for the second quarter, which is within our guidance. Sales for the quarter were below expectations, but improved from the first quarter. We are executing plans to strengthen our top line performance for the rest of the year and expect sequential improvement in the back half. We\u2019re pleased that Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club leveraged expenses for the first half of the year. But, we didn\u2019t leverage expenses in the second quarter as a company. While it will be difficult, we believe the steps we\u2019re taking to control costs, especially in International, will bring us closer to our full-year leverage goal. We will continue to invest in leverage initiatives, compliance and e-commerce as we focus on future growth. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at how our businesses performed in the second quarter. Consolidated net sales and our Walmart U.S. comp were below expectations for the quarter. While the retail environment was challenging across all of our markets, the Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club businesses improved comp sales from the first quarter, and reported sales in International remained consistent. We expect to see improvement in all of our segments in the back half of the year. Walmart U.S. comp sales declined 0.3 percent in the 13-week period ended July 26. Traffic improved from the first quarter, and we gained market share in key categories. We continue to invest in price and we are focused on delivering positive comps during the next two quarters. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.7 percent for the 13-week period. The improved merchandise assortment and Instant Savings program drove membership growth. Business member traffic also improved. I\u2019m pleased that Sam\u2019s new membership enhancements and fee structure contributed to bottom line improvement. Walmart International\u2019s constant currency net sales were up 4.4 percent. Operating income was substantially better in the second quarter than our first quarter, and increased 40 basis points year-over-year. We achieved expense reduction in some countries, but as we said in the first quarter on our earnings call, we didn\u2019t leverage expenses this quarter given that sales were below expectations. In February, I outlined six key areas that are critical to Walmart\u2019s long-term success. So, let\u2019s look at our report card at the halfway mark this year. First, I said we need to deliver a strong Walmart U.S. business. The underlying business strategy is solid, but year-to-date sales were below our expectations. Traffic trends improved throughout the second quarter as weather normalized and customers responded favorably to the improved quality in our fresh offerings, especially produce. Our apparel and home categories rebounded this quarter, delivering very good comp sales. The team\u2019s cost discipline delivered leverage and strong operating income in the first half of the year and I expect this will continue. We\u2019re also making it more convenient for customers to access Walmart on their shopping terms. Our mobile and online technology investments increased customer engagement and drove double-digit sales growth for walmart.com. This fiscal year, we\u2019re on track to increase our Neighborhood Market fleet by more than 40 percent, reaching new markets and filling in grocery offerings around supercenters. To improve International returns, our second key priority, we must drive expense leverage and lower our cost structure to align with a more challenging retail environment. In the first half, our sales growth was less than we expected. International\u2019s ability to leverage is important to the company\u2019s overall leverage goal and we are committed to improving through productivity and expense savings. Effective cost management is vital to improving returns in International during this low-growth cycle, and we\u2019re taking steps to accomplish this. For example, our China and our global leverage teams partnered to launch a new productivity initiative that is yielding positive results in China. In Mexico, we\u2019re implementing an on-shelf availability application to target and improve in-stock opportunities. And across many of our markets, we\u2019re utilizing workforce management tools to better align associate schedules with customer traffic. These actions, among others, will contribute to International\u2019s leverage goal. On our third priority, I said we must increase capital discipline. I\u2019m pleased with the stronger performance of our new stores, and a number of recent grand openings delivered sales ahead of expectations. We\u2019re making better real estate decisions and driving greater efficiency in our construction of new stores and remodels. Our real estate review meetings are focused on improving returns by reducing costs and increasing sales per square foot. Next is our focus on leverage initiatives. Our leverage teams are partnering with the operating segments to drive greater expense savings. Increased direct import volumes are lowering cost of goods sold. These are savings that we pass along to our customers. In our stores, we\u2019re improving customer experience and reducing costs through enhancements to hybrid and self-checkout register technology. And, we just finished the migration of eight countries in Latin America to our Costa Rican Shared Services Center, which we expect to lower back office costs and improve service levels. The fifth priority that I outlined is winning in e-commerce, and I\u2019m pleased with our progress. Sales globally grew more than 30 percent in the first two quarters, led by the strong performance from our acquisition of Yihaodian. I\u2019m confident that these are the right investments to position the business for long-term success, despite the short-term headwind that they create on financial results. We have ambitious goals, and you\u2019ll hear more from Neil shortly. Last, I told you in February that we would continue to strengthen Walmart\u2019s compliance organization. We\u2019ve enhanced processes and procedures, associate training and organizational leadership. We now have chief compliance officers in substantially all markets and regions, and anti-corruption directors in almost all markets. Together, they are continuing to implement compliance systems, conduct regular risk assessments and increase training for our associates. Walmart continues to focus on areas that help our customers and our associates live better. Bill and I recently visited stores in Tennessee, West Virginia and Georgia. I saw how our associates appreciated the focus on opportunity in our recent Shareholders Meeting and the programs we have in place to help them achieve their personal objectives. When Doug and I went to stores in Brazil, Japan, Argentina and Chile, it was gratifying to see how our focus on the customer translates globally. In every market, we have the most committed associates who display a passion for helping our customers to save money and live better. I\u2019m really looking forward to visiting more of our stores again this quarter. Before I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m encouraged by our position to execute in the second half of the year, particularly with the steps we\u2019re taking to improve performance. There are areas of our business where we can do a better job, and we will. I\u2019m confident in our associates\u2019 ability to deliver for our customers with EDLP and for shareholders with improved sales and expense savings. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff? Jeff Davis : Thank you Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 14, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share of $1.24 versus $1.18 last year, a 5.1 percent increase. As we told you, we expect to invest an incremental $0.09 per share in ecommerce for the full year. This investment for Q2 was approximately $0.03 per share. In addition, EPS was impacted by approximately $0.01 due to a charge for a certain non-income tax matter recorded in operating expenses within Walmart International. Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to the detailed financial results for the second quarter. Consolidated net sales increased 2.4 percent or $2.7 billion, to $116.2 billion. The quarter included $216 million from acquisitions, which was offset by a negative impact of approximately $680 million from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.8 percent. With respect to our comp sales, total U.S. comps, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period ended July 26. You will hear more details on our separate Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club comps from Bill and Roz. While Sam\u2019s Club delivered positive gains in membership, consolidated membership and other income decreased 4.3 percent, compared to the second quarter of last year due to Walmart U.S. and International. Total revenue was $116.9 billion, a 2.3 percent increase over last year. Our gross profit rate for Q2 was 24.8 percent, an increase of 19 basis points compared to last year. The increase was primarily driven by our Walmart U.S. and International segments. You\u2019ll hear more from Bill and Doug on the specific drivers. Now turning to expenses, operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.5 percent, which represents a 20 basis point increase versus last year. As always, let\u2019s take a closer look at Corporate and support expenses, which increased 31 percent and is comprised of 3 areas : Core corporate, Global eCommerce support, and Global leverage services. Our core corporate expenses increased 12.2 percent. Expenses related to FCPA and compliance matters were approximately $82 million, which was above our forecasted range of $65 to $70 million. Approximately $48 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations. Approximately $34 million is related to global compliance programs and organizational enhancements. It is important to note that excluding these FCPA and compliance matters, core corporate expenses would have decreased approximately 2.2 percent. The remainder of Corporate and support expense growth is associated with our ongoing initiatives within global leverage services and Global eCommerce support. These expenses reflect investments for the future and remain a headwind for the remainder of the year. Neil will provide additional insights into recent developments and investments within eCommerce. This leads us to consolidated operating income, which grew 1.4 percent to $6.8 billion. Net interest expense increased 9.5 percent to $553 million. The increase was primarily the result of a prior year release of interest accruals on tax-related matters and higher debt balances. That brings us to consolidated net income. Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart was $4.1 billion, an increase of approximately 1.3 percent. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32.5 percent. As a reminder, we may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate as it may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, tax law changes, audit results, discrete items and a mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. A little later, Charles will provide an update for our projected tax rate for the fiscal year. From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 5.5 percent, primarily driven by softer than expected sales within our operating segments and timing of receipts of merchandise. You\u2019ll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding inventory levels. Payables as a percentage of inventory was 85.8 percent, which compares to 88.9 percent last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased levels of inventory within our Walmart U.S. and International segments and the timing of payments. Our debt to total capitalization was 44.4 percent at the end of the quarter, compared to 43.7 percent last year. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2013 compared to $6.1 billion last year. The timing of tax payments and growth of capital expenditures were the primary drivers of the decline. Clearly one of our financial priorities is to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In Q2, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends. In addition, we repurchased approximately $1.9 billion of shares, representing approximately 24.2 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $13.9 billion remaining under our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced in June of 2013. Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2013 was 17.9 percent, compared to 18.1 percent for the prior year. The reduction was primarily the result of acquisitions and an increase in fixed assets within the base business. Now, let\u2019s move on to the discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S. Bill? Bill Simon : Thank you Jeff. I\u2019m proud of the great work the team did, leading us to a solid quarter in profit in a disappointing sales environment. Net sales grew 2.1 percent to $68.7 billion, with about $1.4 billion added in sales year over year. For the quarter, we delivered a negative 0.3 percent sales comp. Traffic decreased 0.5 percent and ticket increased 0.2 percent. The lack of meaningful inflation and the 2 percent increase in payroll taxes impacted our results; however our performance reflects more than a 100 basis point improvement over Q1. Nevertheless, I was encouraged by the improvement we saw, as traffic and comp sales increased throughout the quarter. We also saw some slight increases in inflation towards the end of the quarter. In addition, there were some key parts of the business, like produce, home and apparel, that were very successful. We\u2019ll talk about these in a bit. We also continued to gain market share across several categories. According to The Nielsen Company, we gained 14 basis points of market share in the measured category of \u201cfood, consumables and health & wellness/OTC\u201d during the 13 weeks ending July 20th. Year to date, we\u2019ve grown sales by $1.6 billion versus last year to $135.3 billion, leading to almost $570 million in operating income growth, and putting us at $10.9 billion in operating income for the first half of the year. Now, let\u2019s cover additional financial details. During the quarter, we continued working with our suppliers to drive cost of goods savings. These initiatives, along with more favorable merchandise mix and logistics productivity, benefited gross profit rate. Overall, our gross profit rate was up 23 basis points, leading to an increase of 2.9 percent in gross profit dollars. We continue to monitor the pricing environment in each market to ensure price leadership, which is the cornerstone of our business strategy. Our stores and operations team did a great job managing expenses, delivering solid operating income growth in a challenging sales environment. Operating expenses grew by only 1.7 percent to $13.8 billion, providing 7 basis points of expense leverage. This leverage helped us deliver a strong bottom line for the quarter, with operating income growing at 5.2 percent, twice the rate of sales growth. Year to date, operating expenses were only up 0.25 percent versus last year. Inventory was up 6.9 percent, primarily driven by softer than anticipated sales trends, the delay in summer weather and timing shifts in the receipt of merchandise for back to school and the upcoming holiday season. While we\u2019re not concerned about the quality of the inventory, it will continue to be an area of focus in the coming months, as we get ready for the key holiday season and continue to balance in-stock and an expanded assortment. Now, let\u2019s turn to some of our savings initiatives. We continued to fuel the productivity loop in the second quarter, maintaining competitive price gaps while delivering strong profit results. Merchants, operators and our logistics team continued to work together on key leverage opportunities. The logistics team reduced cost per case shipped year over year for the eighth consecutive quarter. Continuous improvement in trailer loading efficiency, as well as alignment and routing optimization, helped the transportation fleet produce another quarter of solid savings, with an increase of 3.7 percent in cases transported per mile driven. Our store operations team continued to leverage technology and innovation to drive productivity across all areas of the store. The investments we\u2019ve made in self-service checkouts are increasing the flexibility of our front-end processes and at the same time reducing operating costs. We expanded self-service checkouts across the chain, with 1,400 more lanes added during the second quarter. Our customers appreciate the added flexibility, and we experienced a 4 percent increase in the utilization rate year-over-year. We\u2019ll continue our planned installations of self-service checkouts across the country during the third quarter. Our associates work hard to serve our customers, and we continue to emphasize the overall customer experience, even as we achieve productivity improvements within the box. I\u2019m pleased to say that, during the second quarter, customer experience scores improved versus the previous quarter. We\u2019re also exceptionally focused on in-stock, and we\u2019re pleased that this metric continues to improve. Our goal is always to have the right product on the shelf when the customer wants it. During the second quarter, we placed additional emphasis on select, core items most relevant to our customers, and experienced in-stock improvements. Our operations management teams continue to focus on the bottom performing stores to drive better on-shelf availability. As we gear up for the back half of the year, we\u2019ll continue to monitor these key measures, maintaining a healthy balance between our expense leverage goals and customer experience. Now let\u2019s look at the performance of our merchandise areas in more detail. I\u2019m encouraged by the strong performance in such key areas as produce, home and apparel, where our focus on quality and value fueled growth. For the quarter, grocery sales, which includes food and consumables, grew by nearly $1 billion. We delivered delivered a slightly negative comp for the retail period. Our results were influenced by lower than anticipated inflation, even deflation in some areas, including dry grocery, frozen and snacks and beverages. Softer performance among these larger categories impacted our overall comp by more than 50 basis points. Adult beverages continued a solid trend of results, delivering a high single-digit comp. Our produce business also continued to gain momentum, delivering a strong mid single-digit comp. We\u2019re getting more efficient at transporting the product from farm to shelf. We\u2019re executing weekly store audits and equipping associates with additional skills and tools to ensure quality and freshness. We\u2019re also letting our customers know about it through our \u201cfresh over\u201d marketing campaign and our new \u201c100 percent money back guarantee.\u201d What\u2019s even more encouraging was that we saw consistently improving comps in produce throughout the quarter, with a high single-digit comp in July. We also gained market share across our consumables business. However, similar to last quarter, our overall performance was somewhat soft as customers traded down, particularly in the categories where product loyalty is not the primary factor in a purchase decision. As the quarter progressed, our seasonal categories improved, but not enough to offset the early declines. Pets delivered another quarter of low single-digit positive comps and close to 30 basis points of market share gains, for the 13 weeks ending July 20th, according to Nielsen. We expect our grocery performance to improve in the third quarter, driven by new and exclusive products and innovation. Health and wellness reported relatively flat comps, while improving significantly versus the prior quarter. The improvement was led by our prescription business, which lapped major generic launches last year and saw an increase in overall script count. Our over-the-counter business continued its positive trend, driven by a strong assortment in active nutrition and weight control. An area that I\u2019m particularly excited about is our diabetics offering. The team has worked diligently to provide high quality products for our customers in both over-the-counter and prescription, driving a double-digit comp in diabetics for the quarter. Hardlines, including seasonal, had a low single-digit negative comp. When average temperatures improved in the back half of the quarter, sales picked up significantly in sporting goods, which delivered a low single-digit comp. Sales in sporting goods partly offset softer sales in other weather related categories. In our stationery and crafts department, we overlapped the re-introduction of fabrics last year. Overall, we gained close to 60 basis points of market share in the stationery category for the three-month period ending in June, according to The NPD Group. The seasonal business also saw moderate sales growth during the quarter, driven by Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day and Fourth of July. Entertainment, including toys, posted a mid single-digit negative comp. Our performance was pressured by soft results in both electronics and media and gaming. Mid single-digit industry deflation and softer discretionary spending continued to be significant headwinds for these categories, while the anticipation of new video game consoles caused further delays in spending for gaming. Within electronics, we\u2019re disappointed at the performance of the TV category, as we lost market share for the 3 months ending June 30, according to NPD. Wireless again showed sales strength, gaining over 350 basis points in unit share over an already large base, allowing us to remain the number one handset retailer in unit share for the 3 months ending June 30, according to NPD. In toys, summer seasonal categories, including water toys and pools, improved consistently over the quarter. However, the progress was not enough to offset the declines we experienced earlier in the quarter when the weather was cooler. While warm-weather categories were challenged, the team delivered strong growth in bicycles and indoor categories. Apparel delivered a low single-digit positive comp, on top of a solid comp last year. I\u2019m really proud of the team. We\u2019ve raised the quality of our offering through improved fabrics and fit and introduced quality brands, driving traffic and sales. For the quarter, children\u2019s delivered a mid single-digit positive comp, driven by strong performance in active wear, shorts and knit tops. Men\u2019s posted a mid single-digit positive comp over a strong comp last year. The addition of brands like \u201cBen Hogan\u201d and \u201cAnd1\u201d is driving excitement and momentum in the men\u2019s department. Shoes and intimate apparel also reported strong growth. We expect the progress we\u2019ve made in our apparel business to continue through the second half of the year, as value, innovation and increased quality fuel results. Home also reported a low single-digit positive comp. Outdoor living had a slower start, but the business quickly picked up helping us deliver a high single-digit comp. The team was ready to capitalize on the warmer weather with new and expanded brands like Snapper mowers and Weber grills. I\u2019m also pleased with our progress in live plants. We\u2019re making great strides to ensure the freshness of our plants and our customers are noticing, evident by our double-digit positive comp during the second quarter. In indoor living, cooking and dining continued on its positive trend, driven by small electric appliances. Our bath and bedding category also improved consistently throughout the quarter, finishing the period with a low single-digit positive comp. Our relative success in the softlines business helped contribute to our favorable gross margin mix I spoke of earlier. The back-to-school season is well under way, and we\u2019re committed to helping customers save money in time for school this year. We\u2019ll have consistently low prices all season long, both online and in stores, helping parents and students shop however they want to shop. This year, we\u2019re carrying more than 250 different school supplies for less than $1 each. Our price gap on back-to-school supplies is evident when you read various news reports that name Walmart the price leader for the season. Now, let me now change gears and talk about the growth opportunity we have with our small formats. We continue to be excited about both the Neighborhood Markets and the Express stores, as we enter several new markets, optimize the assortment and improve the convenience. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the performance of Neighborhood Markets. We continue to roll out this format aggressively throughout the country, opening more sites in the second quarter than in any other quarter in our history. In fact, we opened 12 stores in just one day this quarter. The format continued on a solid trend of results, delivering more than 30 percent top line growth and consistent solid comp growth. Our comp growth was driven by strong traffic trends, as customers respond to our expanded assortment and focus on fresh foods, with produce, adult beverages and consumables setting the pace, and driving customers\u2019 intentions for return trips. What\u2019s also encouraging is that we\u2019re running these smaller stores the Walmart way, fueling the productivity loop, leveraging expenses and driving operating income growth in our comp stores. Our Express format also delivered strong results and continued to provide important insights into small format operations. During the quarter, stores opened more than a year achieved another quarter of strong double-digit comp sales growth. We continue to integrate our e-commerce platform with our stores to create a unique shopping experience. During the quarter, we launched the locker test for site-to-store in the Washington, D.C. area. While this test is still in the early stages, the initial read on customer satisfaction and acceptance is very encouraging, with 90 percent of the customers who have used the service providing positive feedback. On the mobile front, we continued testing our \u201cScan and Go\u201d pilot, improving the experience and expanding it to Android devices. You\u2019ve heard us talk about how our physical presence represents a significant competitive advantage for our walmart.com business. Last time we spoke, we announced the expansion of our Ship from Store program, and I\u2019m proud to say the momentum continued. A steadily increasing percentage of all items shipped to customers\u2019 homes are now fulfilled through the Ship from Store program. The majority of orders are delivered in two days or less and at a lower cost. In the second quarter, our real estate team added 49 net new units, or 4.1 million incremental square feet, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. The new units were composed of 29 supercenters and 35 small formats, most of which were Neighborhood Markets. Our growth over the first half of the year puts us at 7.7 million incremental square feet. In the third quarter, we\u2019re planning to open approximately 90 units, representing 7 million additional square feet. On Memorial Day, we launched the veterans initiative and received an impressive response from the veteran community. In a little over 2 months, we hired more than 3,200 new Walmart veteran associates and continue to process applications. Given the current economic environment, we expect our comps to be relatively flat in the coming quarter. We remain confident about the back half of the year, as we continue to execute on initiatives to drive our business, and in particular, our top line. The customer remains challenged, but I\u2019m confident in our position and in the ability of our teams to execute. Our strategy is sound, our pricing position is solid and our ability to leverage is strong, all of which bodes well as our comps continue to improve. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug for an International update. Doug Doug McMillon : Thanks Bill. Across our International markets, growth in consumer spending is under pressure. During the first half of the year, we saw consumers in both mature and emerging markets curb their spending, and we believe these trends will persist through the remainder of the year. While this creates a challenging sales environment, we are the best equipped retailer to address the needs of our customers and help them save money. We clearly have plenty of opportunities to drive further improvement going forward, though we have made improvements in some markets. We\u2019re focused on three key areas : First, as we focus on growth, we are delivering price leadership. We track the savings we offer customers on a basket of goods across our markets and invest where necessary to ensure value for them. We continue to move toward more of an EDLP approach across the entire division, because this is the most effective way to deliver value to our customers. Delivering on our core merchandising and pricing strengths is foundational. In addition to that foundation, we are expanding our capabilities to serve customers through e-commerce, home delivery and relevant store formats. Driving sales growth, regardless of the market environment, is a top priority. Second, we\u2019re focused on driving the productivity loop. The work we started over a year ago to transfer our best operational practices into several of our key markets is helping us. The softer than expected sales growth and wage inflation in some markets masked the improvements we\u2019ve made operationally, but I\u2019m thankful we\u2019ve made them, or our expense position would be more difficult. We need to continue down this path and improve sales to show the benefits more clearly. As Mike mentioned earlier, our leadership teams in International are collaborating with our Global Business Process team to improve productivity through a focus on process. I\u2019ll give you some specific examples in a few minutes that show you how we are getting stronger at the basics. It\u2019s obvious that we should spread our best operational practices to situations where it makes sense, and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re finally learning how to do that more effectively. I believe this is an important part of our future and, ultimately, a key lever for us to improve returns in this division. And third, we\u2019re focused on efficient use of capital. We\u2019re investing significant time and energy into our new store program to make sure that each approved project delivers against our forecast and that we use our capital dollars efficiently as the buildings are designed and constructed. We\u2019re finding new approaches to lighting and refrigeration, for example, that help us create stronger returns and reduce the impact on the environment. In addition, inventory management is a priority. I\u2019ll cover the numbers in just a second, but given our softness in sales, you\u2019ll see that many of our markets have reacted fairly well. Net sales grew 2.9 percent over last year to $33.0 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales were $33.4 billion, up 4.4 percent as currency exchange rates negatively impacted reported sales by $680 million in the quarter. Acquisitions added $216 million. Gross profit rate, on a reported basis, rose 29 basis points, and on a constant currency basis, increased 44 basis points. This was driven by rate improvements on a constant currency basis in Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., and Africa. We will cover some of the drivers of this change later in the country highlights. Operating income declined 1.3 percent on a reported basis and improved 40 basis points compared to last year on a constant currency basis. As Jeff mentioned, these results were impacted due to a charge for a certain non-income tax matter of $52 million on a reported basis. Without this charge, our operating income results for the quarter would have been up 2.2 percent on a reported basis and 3.9 percent on constant currency basis. As expected, operating expenses grew faster than sales. Expenses deleveraged by 40 basis points on a reported basis and 54 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results include the charge for a certain non-income tax matter mentioned previously. Without this charge, International operating expenses deleveraged by 24 basis points on a reported basis and by 38 basis points on a constant currency basis. While operating expenses grew, these results don\u2019t tell the whole story. The Asia region leveraged expenses during the quarter, along with Chile, Central America and Africa. Mexico also achieved substantial savings in key areas, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the weaker than expected sales. Like the first quarter, several factors contributed to us not leveraging expenses -- weaker sales, wage inflation, higher indirect taxes, and strategic investments, including e-commerce. In many of our International markets, labor laws and employment contracts mean it takes more time and is more complicated to introduce and implement productivity improvements that can help us adjust labor costs to sales trends. While our core expense story has improved, we expect third quarter expenses to be under pressure, also due to the same factors I just mentioned. We are working hard to leverage expenses in the back half of the year, and our Global Business Processes team is part of the answer to our expense challenge as we drive productivity in key markets. The China team\u2019s efforts resulted in productivity gains, enabling us to reduce store labor hours by 12.4 percent during the second quarter. Those improvements helped us offset wage growth of 11.2 percent over the same period, driven mainly by China\u2019s wage inflation. This, in a nutshell, serves as an example of what we have to get done across most of our markets. Beyond China, the Global On-Shelf Availability application is being rolled out in Mexico, improving in-stock and the ability to target and address issues with product availability for the customer. And finally, Brazil is rolling out best practices in fresh operations, ordering, and inventory flow to reduce throwaways and improve quality for the customer. We also are rolling out the workforce management system across many of our markets to better match work shift needs and personal schedules. Inventory grew 3.7 percent on a reported basis and 7.0 percent on a constant currency basis. And, on a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales in Brazil, Chile, China, Canada and India. Now, let\u2019s move on and discuss the results by market. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis. In all of our countries except Brazil and China, our stores and e-commerce businesses are integrated and led by the same management teams. Therefore, our discussion of results is about the total operation. For Brazil and China, we will provide insights on the stores and e-commerce separately. In the U.K., we continued to grow both sales and operating income in the second quarter of the year. Net sales rose 1.6 percent, and sales excluding fuel, increased 1.1 percent. Operating income grew 7.5 percent, and we did not leverage operating expenses. Comparable sales declined by 0.4 percent, excluding fuel. Average comp traffic increased by 1.0 percent, but was offset by a decline in average ticket of 1.4 percent. Overall market share declined by 30 basis points for the 12 weeks ended July 7 according to the Kantar Worldpanel Total Till Roll. Our operating income performance in the U.K. this quarter was driven by three key themes : first, a significant price investment which is moderating comp growth; second, investment in and growth of convenient channels and formats; and third, cost savings delivered via the \u201cWe operate for less\u201d program to help offset some of the headwinds we\u2019re experiencing. The U.K. is an example of where we are leading with a core strength : investing in price on essential food items. The British consumer remains under pressure, with market inflation growing 2.8 percent, outpacing wage growth of 0.9 percent. Market product inflation is up, but our Asda basket is below market inflation. In addition, the UK is a market with unique competitive vouchering activity. Some of our competition provides a voucher for a discount on a future purchase. During the quarter, according to Kantar Worldpanel, the grocery market grew by 3.5 percent -- driven by inflation of 3.9 percent, meaning grocery volume declined in the market. Our price investment in key food essentials continued, especially in fresh produce, a key traffic driver. As a result, we grew market share in this category. The result was lower inflation across the overall basket for our customers. We continue to drive the \u201cwe operate for less\u201d program, achieving savings within both operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Our improvement of 67 basis points in gross profit rate helped operating income grow faster than sales despite the continued price investment and inflationary pressures in areas such as property taxes, insurance and energy. Our gross profit rate in Asda improved largely because we didn\u2019t repeat promotional activity from last year\u2019s Queen\u2019s jubilee event and the Olympic Games. Our Asda online grocery business is well developed and remains a model for us to leverage into other markets. Online sales, which are included in our net sales and comps, were strong in the quarter, growing over 16 percent. We continue to deliver an increasingly convenient, multichannel shopping experience for customers. In the second quarter, our first \u201cDrive Through Click & Collect\u201d site opened in York. We also connected our smart phone app to stores through a new shopping list feature that can search for products using voice recognition or barcode scanning technology. In addition, given the shift in online traffic from desktop to mobile, we\u2019re the first major U.K. retailer to launch a dedicated tablet website for non-food business. The quarter rounded off with some great awards showcasing our continued commitment to EDLP. Asda was recognized by The Grocer magazine in June, when we were named \u201cBritain\u2019s Lowest Priced Supermarket\u201d for the sixteenth year running and \u201cBritain\u2019s Favourite Supermarket\u201d for the third year in a row. Asda continues to make a difference in our local communities. During the quarter, we launched a market leading supply chain initiative delivering the equivalent of 3.5 million meals to local charities across the U.K. We partnered with the charity FareShare and more than 300 chilled food suppliers. This initiative alone will save more than 900 local charities 4.7 million British pounds, or $7.1 million, per year. As we look at Canada, we were challenged by unseasonably cooler weather that continued from the previous quarter, as well as flooding in Alberta. Despite these challenges, net sales grew 6.2 percent, supported by new store growth and expansion of existing stores. Operating income grew slower than sales at 2.3 percent as we invested in new stores and e-commerce. Comparable sales declined by 0.4 percent, with comp ticket up 0.2 percent and comp traffic declining 0.6 percent. We had strong comp sales in food, consumables and apparel, but continued to see softer sales in entertainment as industry-specific challenges persist. The colder weather negatively impacted sales in hardlines. On the positive side, we drove market share gains by investing in price on the items that matter most. In The Nielsen Company measured categories of food and consumables, Walmart Canada gained 110 basis points of share. We also drove a further 60 basis points in health and wellness. Gross profit rate increased 29 basis points due, in part, to cost savings from increased direct importing. Operating expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to negative comp store sales and costs related to year-over-year growth in our new store base, including the 39 Zellers stores we acquired last year. However, through EDLC initiatives, Walmart Canada has been able to offset some of the expense growth with various productivity initiatives. During the quarter, we opened one new supercentre, expanded four stores to supercentres and relocated one store. This includes our first supercentre in Atlantic Canada and provided us with a truly nationwide presence for our supercentre program. We responded to the floods in southern Alberta and the devastating explosion in Quebec through fundraising campaigns in partnership with the Red Cross. Cash and in-kind donations to support these victims exceeded $900,000. Turning to Africa, as you know, Massmart is a publicly-held company in South Africa and announces their results every six months. Massmart\u2019s next earnings release is August 22nd. For the 26 weeks ended June 23rd, net sales increased by 8.9 percent, and comp store sales increased by 5.5 percent. We remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us within Africa, and we\u2019re working to position ourselves for success in the future. Now, let\u2019s cover Latin America. As a reminder, the following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported its earnings on July 25th, under IFRS, so some numbers are different from the Walmex-reported numbers. Walmex results were solid in Central America, but growth slowed in Mexico, and this impacted overall performance. For the quarter, net sales grew 3.2 percent. Gross profit rate increased by 58 basis points versus last year, driven by increases in both Mexico and Central America. In Central America, the gross margin improvement was driven by both EDLC and EDLP execution and better inventory management made possible by the recent integration of Walmart systems. Operating expenses grew faster than sales in Walmex. Operating income for the quarter grew 4.2 percent, faster than sales, primarily due to strong gross profit margins. For the second quarter, Mexico\u2019s sales increased 3.1 percent over last year and comparable store sales decreased 1.6 percent, as they were negatively impacted by the Easter flip. Self-service and Sam\u2019s Club second quarter comparable growth was negative 1.8 percent, which is similar to ANTAD\u2019s comparable store sales reported for the rest of the industry at negative 1.6 percent excluding Walmex. Average comp ticket increased 1.4 percent, and comp traffic decreased 3.0 percent over last year. Traffic was impacted by the Easter calendar shift and a general market slowdown in consumption. In Mexico, gross margin was up 19 basis points. However, operating expenses grew faster than sales. As I mentioned earlier, we improved expense management, but it wasn\u2019t quite enough to offset the sales miss. Wages and utilities remain headwinds. Operating income decreased 0.7 percent, below our expectations. We are working hard to bring expenses more in line with sales. Central America increased net sales from the previous year by 4.2 percent. Comparable store sales decreased 0.1 percent. Gross profit rate increased 2.8 percent versus last year, as a result of better merchandising and EDLP execution. The transition to EDLP in our Central American countries is complete, and these results reflect the opportunity for growth through that strategy. Expenses grew slower than sales. Operating income increased 246 percent. Moving on to Brazil \u2026 second quarter net sales in Brazil grew 2.8 percent from last year, with comparable sales up 1.1 percent. Average ticket grew 6.6 percent, and comp traffic declined 5.5 percent when compared to last year. Sales were impacted by the Easter flip, a holiday which represents one of the biggest seasons for food sales in Brazil. Despite this impact, the retail formats showed positive comps, with good performance in consumables, food and perishables. Our results in the wholesale formats were below expectations. Gross profit rate increased 50 basis points, but we did not leverage operating expenses due in part to the lower comp sales growth and wage inflation. Operating expenses grew faster than sales during the quarter. The net effect of the sales shortfall and our expense performance was an operating loss for the quarter. We continue to focus on the productivity loop in order to invest savings back into price to further drive sales. Brazil is now taking steps to align expenses more closely to the volume of sales. We\u2019re pleased with the growth of e-commerce sales in Brazil. In fact, we grew from the #8 most visited site last October to the #1 spot now, according to comScore. Customers have responded well to the enhancements on the site, and sales are up more than 50 percent versus last year. 25 Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release second quarter earnings on August 30th. Earlier this year, we completed a merchandise training program in Chile focused on modular and buying strategies. Since that training, we have reduced the number of modular changes by 40 percent and reduced the number of price labels by 20 percent, while still maintaining strong price impression. This program is saving labor hours at the store level, but more importantly, it\u2019s improving trust with the customer through a more consistent set of modulars. This is another good example of where global experience can benefit a local market. Moving to Asia, in the second quarter, without the acquisition of Yihaodian, Walmart China\u2019 s net sales grew 6.3 percent over last year and comparable store sales growth was 2.5 percent. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, customers continue to shift from traditional daily shopping to larger consolidated shopping trips. Average comp ticket grew 9.3 percent in China, while traffic declined 6.8 percent. Our EDLP journey in China continues to move forward. We\u2019re building trust with the Chinese customer through our \u201cworry free\u201d program. Worry free pricing was launched last fall and continues to gain traction. The team in China continues to improve operations by focusing on optimizing the buying organization, investing in logistics and food safety and simplifying the supply chain. Gross profit rate declined 56 basis points compared to last year. We leveraged operating expenses despite wage inflation. As I mentioned earlier, Walmart China reduced store labor hours through various productivity initiatives and improved scheduling. Last year, we discussed our decision to moderate our growth in China and focus more on our store opening process and opening stores in more productive locations, an example of our commitment to simplifying and prioritizing. Our team in China is making progress with the customer and as a retail operator. I\u2019m really encouraged by the recent results in China and thankful for the strong leadership we\u2019re seeing from Greg Foran, Sean Clarke and the rest of the leadership team. And, a final comment on e-commerce in China. We\u2019re pleased with the acquisition of Yihaodian, with sales continuing to grow well in the double digits. The site continues to be one of the fastest-growing e-commerce businesses in the country. In Japan, consumer spending continued to be soft during the quarter. Walmart Japan\u2019s net sales growth remained flat and comp sales decreased 0.6 percent. During the quarter, we posted our first positive monthly comp since May of 2012. Our stores continue to create a better price impression for customers as they are shopping. Second quarter comp traffic decreased 1.1 percent, and average ticket increased 0.5 percent. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined 1.3 percent from last year, so we outperformed the market. Gross profit rate in Japan decreased 13 basis points, due to our investment in lower prices. Compared to last year, Walmart Japan had higher operating income and increased operating margin 13 basis points. Walmart Japan also leveraged operating expenses versus last year due to tight cost control efforts. In Japan, we continue to leverage Walmart\u2019s global scale to improve customer assortment and deliver better value to our customers. Examples are beef imported from the United States, and cherries, wine and beer from the U.K., and we had great results from introducing \u201cGolden Ale\u201d beer in Japan. In just one month, it became Japan\u2019s second best-selling beer in the 500 ml beer category and the most profitable in the entire beer category. As you are aware, we have a significant effort and investment under way to enhance compliance. We\u2019re committed to compliance and integrity everywhere we operate. These investments are building a stronger, better Walmart for our customers, our associates and communities, and will provide a more solid foundation for future growth. Although I only mentioned a couple of examples today, we remain committed globally to improving the communities where we live and operate. In addition to responding to disasters and helping those in need, other programs create a better Walmart and a better shopping experience for our customers -- like developing local farmers and supporting the growth of women-owned businesses. We appreciate all the hard work of our international associates. The third quarter is well under way for our markets. In a global macroeconomic environment where the rate of growth is less than expected, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our consumers through our EDLC-EDLP approach. EDLP improves our ability to deliver against our purpose and better serve our customers who count on us to meet their family\u2019s needs. We expect the third and fourth quarters to be better than our results in the first half, and we\u2019re working hard to deliver operating expense leverage for Walmart International. Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Roz for a look at our Sam\u2019s U.S. business. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks Doug. Before I start, I\u2019d like to compliment both our management teams and our Sam\u2019s Club associates. They are so energized by the changes taking place in our clubs and remain aligned on driving member value through price leadership, differentiated merchandise and a compelling experience. We still have work to do, but I\u2019m pleased to report that Q2 comp sales were within our guidance, and traffic improved. We are delivering solid membership income growth, and our recent membership enhancements, including the Instant Savings Book (ISB), continue to receive a favorable response. Let me take a moment to provide more background on our Instant Savings program, now a cornerstone of Sam\u2019s Club membership. In fact, we have renamed our Advantage members to Savings members because of our mission to deliver savings made simple for all of our members. The second quarter marked the launch of our Instant Savings program. Members received two Instant Savings Books during the quarter. Each book runs for about three weeks and includes special savings from our top suppliers beyond our normal member-only prices. We were pleased to see over half of the members who shopped during the events purchased at least one Instant Savings Book item. The book not only drove traffic to our clubs, but also broader awareness of our extensive merchandise offering available at samsclub.com. For example, during the first few days of the May event, we sold more of the office chairs online included in the ISB than we had year-to-date! We believe that the investment we\u2019re making in price, both through core reductions and programs like Instant Savings, are key to sales growth, and this strategy will continue throughout the year. Now back to the results. Sam\u2019s Club generated a comp of 1.7 percent, without fuel, for the 13-week retail sales period. Our investment in the ISB program decreased our overall average selling price, resulting in a comp ticket decline of 1.0 percent. This was countered by comp traffic growth of 2.7 percent, driven by positive traffic for both our Savings and business members. We were pleased with our improvement in business member traffic, reversing the first quarter\u2019s decrease in business member traffic. Small business owners report through our monthly Small Business Owner study, that they are more optimistic about the upcoming months and perceive that the current economic climate is gradually improving. We believe their businesses are beginning to show signs of recovery, as evidenced by the improved traffic trends. As part of our commitment to this portion of our member base, Sam\u2019s Club recently launched the 25-city \u201cGrow Your Business Boot Camp\u201d series. It\u2019s a program that allows leaders at Sam\u2019s to support small business owners and entrepreneurs in their local communities. Now on to our core financial news \u2026 Net sales, including fuel, were $14.5 billion, up 2.6 percent over last year. Fuel prices increased 1.6 percent compared to last year and gallons sold were up 2.6 percent, thus creating a boost to overall sales of 22 basis points. Sam\u2019s gross profit rate declined by 15 basis points, and we leveraged expenses, improving operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 3 basis points. Operating income increased 3 percent to $551 million. Our goal remains to grow inventory at half the rate of sales, and we are pleased at the progress compared to the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel, was up just 2 percent.  : Net sales for the quarter were $12.8 billion, up 2.4 percent from last year. All geographic divisions had positive comps. Inflation, excluding fuel, was about 30 basis points. Inflation in fresh meat and dairy was coupled with continued deflation in electronics. Last year, retail inflation was between 175 and 225 basis points, primarily in food. Fresh posted a low single-digit comp, driven by strength in breads and produce. Lingering effects of unseasonably cold weather affected produce availability in some of our key summer fruit items, such as strawberries and watermelons. We overcame this headwind with exceptional quality in other seasonal produce items such as blueberries and apples, resulting in a mid single-digit produce comp. Unit sales of fresh meat remain strong; however, we have seen some trade-down from steaks to lower price point items, such as chicken and pork. \u201cBetter for you\u201d items continue to resonate with our members who are searching for healthier options. Our grocery and beverage category generated a low single-digit comp. Members responded positively to our dry grocery Instant Savings Book items. However, the growth was not enough to offset seasonal softness in beverages, as Q2 this year was cooler than last year. We continue to execute our strategy of bringing newness and differentiation to these categories, particularly in areas such as craft beers. Our efforts to reach families with babies continued to pay off, with market share gains in the baby category for the 13-week period ending July 6, 2013, according to Nielsen. Additionally, the ISB events contributed to the growth in consumables, resulting in a low single-digit comp for the quarter. Technology and entertainment posted a low single-digit negative comp. Positive Instant Savings Book event performance and continued strength in wireless was tempered by softness in the overall consumer electronics market, as shoppers continue to shift spending from TVs and laptops to mobile devices. In home and apparel, we were pleased that sales rebounded from the prior quarter, delivering a high single-digit comp in Q2. As the weather warmed, our offerings in apparel and seasonal categories resonated with members and generated low double-digit comps and mid single-digits, respectively. Home continues to be strong, as price leadership in domestics drove double-digit comp and unit growth. Health and wellness, including pharmacy, reported a mid single-digit comp, propelled by sustained strength in the over-the-counter products and growth in optical. During Q2, we lapped the branded-to-generic status change of several popular prescriptions, which should serve as a tailwind to pharmacy sales during the back half of the year. Tobacco sales growth was essentially flat. A nationwide price increase in June drove business members to accelerate tobacco purchases, providing a moderate benefit to the beginning of the quarter. Sam\u2019s Club online business continues to grow, driven by solid traffic and improved conversion rates. Merchandise strength came from outdoor living, portable electronics, baby care, and mattresses that offset some of the general softness in other electronics categories. Recently, the team has made enhancements to our mobile app, helping to increase the number of mobile orders, compared to the prior quarter. Now, let\u2019s continue with the results. Gross profit rate grew 6 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 2 basis points. Membership and other income grew 9.2 percent. On May 15, we took our first nationwide membership fee increase in 6 years. During the quarter, net membership income increased 4 percent. Our primary base continues to grow year-over-year, driven by Savings member sign-ups. Plus sign-ups and upgrades also showed strength, partially offset by softness in business member sign-ups. Remember, we recognize the full benefit of the fee increase over the 12-month membership period. Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income grew to $552 million, a substantial increase of 8 percent over last year. As I mentioned earlier, the level of engagement among our club associates is very strong. In our annual engagement survey conducted this past spring, Sam\u2019s Club associate engagement scores rose 600 basis points over last year, with gains in each geographic division across the country. Over the past quarter, I\u2019ve visited several recently remodeled clubs. I\u2019ve been pleased with the disciplined progress the team has made to increase the consistency of our remodels. Next quarter, we will open 13 new and relocated clubs, the greatest number of clubs opened during one quarter within the past several years. The team is ready to continue growing the Sam\u2019s footprint, serving even more members in more communities. Last quarter, I mentioned that you will begin to see a change in our merchandise strategy. We\u2019ve begun this transformation, specifically in areas such as home and apparel. Our members look to us for great values on the best quality items, and we will continue working hard to deliver, striving to be a house of brands for our members. This transformation will continue, especially as we enter the holiday season. I\u2019m excited to invite you to our upcoming VIP event. Please join me, on August 18, as we open our doors exclusively to Plus members, appreciating them with exceptional values on an array of back-to-school items and unique, one-time buys. VIP events such as these are just one of the ways we have worked to strengthen our value proposition for Plus members. We will continue to stress seasonal offerings throughout the third quarter. We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 27 to October 25 to range between flat and 2 percent. Last year\u2019s comp, without fuel, for the period was 2.7 percent. The core business at Sam\u2019s Club is strong. I\u2019m confident that the things we\u2019re doing today to strengthen our value proposition will benefit Sam\u2019s over the long term. Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Neil for e-commerce. Neil? Neil Ashe : Thanks Roz. In eCommerce, we\u2019ve continued to deliver key capabilities, and we are growing sales, including acquisitions, at over 30 percent globally. Bill, Roz and Doug touched on some of the accomplishments from around the world, and I\u2019ll put those in the context of our overall eCommerce strategies. As a reminder, the four strategies we are executing are : Excelling in the fundamentals of e-commerce; innovating in new areas like big data, social and mobile; we\u2019re growing in key markets, namely the U.S., U.K., Brazil and China; and we\u2019re providing the tie to unite and expand the Walmart customer experience to do what no one else can do. We\u2019re building best-in-class e-commerce capabilities, and only we can combine those with the assets of the world\u2019s largest retailer. The result is a new approach to commerce that lets customers shop when, where and how they want across online, mobile and stores. To support the strategies, we\u2019re investing in three key areas : further developing our global technology platform; growing services and capabilities in our four key markets; and developing our next-generation fulfillment network that integrates dedicated online assets with Walmart\u2019s transportation fleet, distribution centers and stores. Before I jump into each of these, let me cover our progress in building talent density. We\u2019ve continued to bring on great people organically and through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we had a hiring blitz which ramped up our visibility in the Bay area and added nearly 200 associates. We saw an offer acceptance rate well over 90 percent. People in Silicon Valley are excited to come to Walmart. We also closed four acquisitions -- Tasty Labs, OneOps, Inkiru and Torbit. They brought us some proven innovators in Silicon Valley, and technical capabilities and expertise to contribute to the development of our global technology platform. We continue to develop and release elements of our technology platform, like search and the walmart.com home page. We\u2019re pleased with the progress to date and excited the experience for our customers is already improving as a result. The platform is also at the core of expanding our product assortment, especially in the U.S. We doubled the number of products on walmart.com in the first half of the year through our own inventory and through new marketplace sellers. We expect to double it again in the second half of the fiscal year. On the fulfillment front, we are optimizing how we use online fulfillment centers in conjunction with Walmart\u2019s shipping network, DCs and stores. Bill touched on how we are activating supercenters as part of our work to deliver a better customer experience, and we\u2019re seeing great results on that front. We are now using 35 stores as additional nodes in our online fulfillment network. As Bill mentioned, those stores now handle a double-digit percentage of walmart.com orders, and the majority of those are delivered in two days or less at a significantly lower cost. As you know, the Pick Up Today option gives customers the ability to buy an item online and pick it up in a store that same day. We have more than tripled the items available for Pick Up Today since the beginning of the year. And, we have developed a new capability that automatically searches our broader inventory for an item if that item isn\u2019t available in a customer\u2019s primary store. That has significantly improved our fill rate. We\u2019ve also talked about our plans to test lockers as another option for customers picking up online orders in stores. The test is successful so far, showing 90 percent customer satisfaction ratings. On the grocery delivery front, Asda is a leader in online grocery delivery, and we\u2019ve leveraged that experience in the U.S. pilot program. In the San Francisco/San Jose test, we\u2019ve proven we can successfully use a supercenter for online grocery delivery, and we\u2019re getting high marks from customers. Many of these are new customers. 75 percent of the customers say they would have purchased through another retailer other than Walmart. And, 83 percent would recommend Walmart grocery delivery. Roz talked about the e-commerce growth at Sam\u2019s Club, and we\u2019ve been working together to enhance the customer experience across online, mobile and clubs. We built a new mobile app for Sam\u2019s Club that helped increase the average basket by almost 25 percent over the last quarter. We also made enhancements on the mobile site that helped double the number of orders from the last quarter. As Doug discussed, we had several global successes as well. Continuing on the mobile theme, we\u2019re making great progress in China. Yihaodian saw 10 times growth in mobile sales in the first half over last year and won a Cannes Media Lions award for its boundless Yihaodian 2.0 app. Yihaodian overall continues to grow quickly. We are pleased that we have more than doubled the number of active site users in the past year, meaning those customers who made at least one purchase in the last 12 months. In the U.K., we just completed a major relaunch of the Asda site. In addition to a new experience, we made some foundational changes that allow us to enhance the site much more quickly and easily. Major redesigns like this one take a bit of time for customers to get used to the enhancements, so we\u2019re pleased to see initial site satisfaction is up 9 percent versus the previous site. Finally, we are excited about the opportunity we have in Brazil and the world-class leadership team we\u2019ve built there. During the quarter, we made several site enhancements to walmart.com.br, including streamlined navigation and check-out flow. We are the largest traffic consumer e-commerce site in Brazil and our revenue growth \u2013 led by electronics and appliances \u2013 is more than double the rate of the total Brazilian e-commerce market according to eMarketer. And, we were recognized by eBit as the top e-commerce site over 4,000 other sites. To wrap up \u2026 we are making great progress on our core strategies. We are continuing to invest for the long-term and are building the talent base, the technology platform and the fulfillment networks we need to serve customers around the globe seamlessly across online, mobile and stores in a way that only Walmart can. Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Charles for the close. Charles? Charles Holley : Thanks Neil. Normally on our earnings call, I begin by talking about growth, leverage and returns and then conclude with our guidance. Today, I\u2019d like to start by providing our expectations for sales and earnings for the third quarter and the full year. Economic conditions in many of our markets around the world remain difficult. The U.S. retail environment remains challenging, with virtually no inflation in food and the higher payroll tax instituted earlier in the year. High fuel prices can impact spending as well. Our expectations for the back half of the year are through a lens of cautious consumer spending. Our mission to save people money so they can live better remains critical to customers and to our ability to drive stronger sales. Our plans are aggressive. We are going after sales and investing in price. And, we continue to focus on leveraging expenses. As Mike said, we are taking steps to increase our leverage potential for the full year. We are revising our consolidated net sales growth to range between 2 and 3 percent for the full year, versus our previous range of 5 to 6 percent. This revision reflects softer sales performance in the first half and our view of current global business trends, including a challenging retail environment, and significant ongoing headwinds from anticipated currency rate fluctuations. In fact, approximately one-third of the net sales revision is due to currency impact. We believe expenses for FCPA matters and for the work on enhancing our compliance program will be higher than originally anticipated for the rest of the year. Year to date, we have spent approximately $155 million. We\u2019re forecasting the run rate for the combined work on the compliance programs and the ongoing investigations to be between $75 and $80 million each in the third and fourth quarters. E-commerce is important to our customers and our company\u2019s future. Our forecasts also take into account that we will continue to invest in technology, talent and infrastructure, including fulfillment centers. Year to date, the incremental impact from e-commerce investments is approximately $0.05 per share. We anticipate the incremental impact to third quarter earnings per share will be about $0.02 per share. Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 to range between $1.11 and $1.16. This compares to $1.08 per share last year. For the full year, we are updating our prior earnings per share guidance to $5.10 and $5.30 per share. This guidance takes into account the challenging sales and operating environments. As we\u2019ve seen in the past, discrete tax items have had a meaningful impact on our effective tax rate and on our reported results in the back half of our fiscal years. We anticipate that a wider range of between 31 and 33 percent is now possible for our full year effective tax rate versus our previous range of 32 to 33 percent. What isn\u2019t changing is our continued focus on Walmart\u2019s financial priorities -- growth, leverage and returns. The company\u2019s growth during the second quarter included 98 net new stores and clubs, comprising 5.9 million new square feet of selling space. Now, let\u2019s talk about leverage. We told you during the first quarter call that achieving operating expense leverage during the second quarter would be challenging \u2013 and that proved to be true. The productivity loop is top of mind across the organization, and we remain focused on delivering leverage for the company by year-end. Long-term strategic investments by our leverage services area pressured operating expense leverage during the past quarter, but we believe the benefits of these investments to our customers and shareholders outweigh the near-term impact on expenses. Earlier, Mike covered a few examples of our leverage progress. We are piloting new programs in logistics to lower the cost of delivery and improve profitability for e-commerce orders. The modular excellence program for Walmart U.S. is helping to maximize holding power for key items in food and consumables. Modular planning processes created by the Global Business Processes team are helping to reduce labor hours in China and Brazil while improving associate productivity. Moving on to returns, we feel good about our earnings per share growth, especially in light of the retail environment. The company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. We also generated solid cash flows from operations, and our free cash flow is now at $5.2 billion for the year. The company continues to deliver strong, consistent returns to shareholders. As I wrap-up the call today, let me leave you with a few key takeaways. First, we know we have to improve the top line. With our expense leverage, stronger sales will flow through our results. Second, our updated guidance reflects the current view of the business and difficult retail environment, but also considers the significant impact from currency, along with the ongoing investments in leverage, e-commerce and compliance initiatives. And, last, we continue to build on our long history of returning value to our shareholders. Thank you for your support and interest in our company. Have a great day!

Carol Schumacher : Hi, this is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Walmart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call of fiscal year 2014. Our press release and transcript of this call are available on our website and again that\u2019s www.stock.walmart.com. Here is today\u2019s agenda. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc., will kick us off with an overview on the quarter\u2019s results and our company\u2019s strategies for this important fourth quarter. Jeff Davis, EVP and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results. Then we\u2019ll move to the operating segments. Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will start followed by Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International and then Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up the call with comments on our financial priorities, as well as detailed analysis on guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Discussions about e-commerce are included throughout the operating segments. We recognize that our retail comp reporting calendar for Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club is different than some of our competitors. Our comp sales week begin on Saturday and runs on Friday. As a reminder, this fiscal year we utilized the 53-week reporting calendar with 4-5-5 reporting for Q4. Therefore, week 53 of this fiscal year will be compared to week 1 of the same current fiscal year 2014. Our fiscal 2014 Q4 reporting period began on October 26 and runs through January 31, 2014. This compares to the 14-week period last year from October 27, 2013 through February 1, 2013. We have posted a fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the Investors portion of our website. Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Walmart, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate are also available on our sites. We have a lot to cover today. Mike will start us off. Mike? Mike Duke : Thanks, Carol and good morning everyone. Today, I am pleased to report a 6.5% increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14 for the third quarter. Walmart delivered solid earnings growth that was also within our guidance range. Our most important priority is growing top line sales, including comps by providing quality merchandise at great prices to customers around the world. The retail environment, both in stores and online, remains competitive. At the same time, some customers feel uncertainty about the economy, government, job stability and their need to take care of their families through the holidays. Walmart has aggressive plans to help our customers enjoy the holiday season and find fantastic gifts for the loved ones while maximizing their budgets at the same time. There is no doubt that we plan to win for our customers and shareholders throughout the holidays. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at how our business performed in the third quarter. Consolidated net sales impacted significantly by currency were below expectations. However we had strong operating income across our segments, Walmart U.S. grew operating income almost 6%, Sam\u2019s Club was up more than 9% and International delivered an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis. Consolidated operating income was $6.3 billion, an increase of 3.6%. Walmart U.S. grew net sales 2.4% to nearly $68 billion in the third quarter. Comp sales declined 0.3% in the 13 week period ended October 25. Traffic continued to improve from the first half of the year and we gained market share again in some of our most important categories. Our neighborhood markets produced comp sales in-line with best in-class competitors. We\u2019re on pace to increase this small format fleet by almost 50% this year. And as you heard in our October Analyst Meeting we\u2019re utilizing our small formats to develop the market eco-system that is a critical part of our long term growth strategy. Bill\u2019s team continues to invest in price to drive sales utilizing savings from our supply chain, logistics and operational efficiencies to help fund these investments. We kicked off the holiday season already starting with some Walmart.com early bird specials on November 1st. We\u2019re excited about some incredible merchandise opportunities for Black Friday. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales without increased 1.1% for the 13 week period. Traffic increased for both business and savings members this quarter. Ross team had one of our strongest grand opening quarters in years with 13 clubs added this quarter. These clubs are well ahead of plan, an example of our greater discipline and focus on delivering higher capital returns. Like Walmart U.S. Sam\u2019s is well positioned for the holiday\u2019s and will offer members tremendous value during two instant savings books. Walmart\u2019s International\u2019s constant currency net sales were up 4.1%, operating income on a constant currency basis increased at nearly twice the rate of sales. Doug\u2019s team is progressing on lowering expenses to rate that\u2019s more in-line with sales and is improving our inventory performance. As you know last month we announced decisions to streamline our international business by actively managing our portfolio and being the best in class operator. International continues to be an important growth engine for Walmart and we will add stores that will position us better in the future for stronger returns. Global e-commerce continues to deliver impressive sales results, including sales from Yihaodian acquired last year, third quarter sales grew nearly 40%. We\u2019re investing in fulfillment centers like the facility recently opened in Fort Worth, Texas to be closer to our customers and to expedite the delivery of their merchandize and we\u2019re accelerating the integration of e-commerce with our business segments. I\u2019m really excited about the fantastic growth opportunities that lie ahead of us as Walmart serves millions of additional customers through our e-commerce sites in 10 countries. Throughout the company we constantly focus on effectively managing our cost so we can provide the low prices that our customers count on. During the third quarter we continue to make progress with expense leverage. On a consolidated basis we improved expense leverage 22 basis points from the second quarter. Walmart U.S. delivered strong expense leverage in the third quarter and international made progress in expense management. By taking advantage of opportunities in area such as technology, logistics, sourcing and workforce planning. We have reinforced our long term commitment to leverage on an annual basis. As you all know our five year goal is to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales by at least 100 basis points by 2017 and we are committed to that note. Today, one of the success areas that I am most proud of is our work on capital discipline. We have really made great strides. Our renewed focus on the productivity of our stores around the world is producing meaningful results. We are bringing down the cost to build, expand and remodel and we are able to open source more throughput. In fact, over the past two years, the cost per square foot for new construction of both super centers and small formats in the United States has come down by over 15%. And when I was in China last month, I saw firsthand, our great store layouts can dramatically improve customer experience and new store openings performance. Clearly, this type of capital discipline is critical to the future growth of this important market. Compliance is in the central part of our growth strategy. In the third quarter, we continue to invest in strengthening Walmart\u2019s compliance organization through enhanced processes and procedures, increased associate training and improved organizational leadership, we have become an even better company. Our progress with compliance makes us a stronger business for the long-term. Walmart has tremendous associates. They are passionate about serving our customers and we appreciate everything they are doing throughout this very busy fourth quarter. When I visit our stores in the U.S. and around the world, like I did recently in China, associates often tell me about their opportunities for building a career and expanding their skills. I love these testimonials. We want to see our talented and dedicated associates advanced to positions of greater leadership within the company. In fact, Walmart U.S. will promote more than 160,000 associates to jobs with higher pay and more responsibility this year. We are also pleased with the progress we made in our veterans initiative since Memorial Day when we kicked off this program Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club have now hired more than 20,000 U.S. veterans to our associate teams. As I close my remarks let me reiterate that Walmart is geared up for the holidays. We are focused on delivering a strong fourth quarter performance. We have the merchandise that customers want online and in the stores all at great prices. And our associates are energized to serve our customers and grow sales. On behalf of everyone at Walmart I wish you happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a great New Year. I hope to see you shopping in our stores and on Walmart.com in the weeks ahead. Now, I will turn it over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff? Jeff Davis : Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart $1.14. This was within our guidance of $1.11 to $1.16. This compares $1.07 last year and reflects a $0.01 per share from the VIPS restaurant business in Mexico. You should note that we reflected the operating results of VIPS as discontinued operations in our financial statements for the current and prior periods. The VIPS sale is subject to regulatory approval, but we expect it to be completed by year end. As you recall, our plan was to invest an incremental $0.09 per share in e-commerce for fiscal 2014. In Q3, we invested $0.03 per share bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $0.08 per share. However, we now expect the fiscal 2014 incremental impact to be approximately $0.10 per share. Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to the detailed financial results for the quarter. Consolidated net sales increased 1.6% or $1.8 billion to $114.9 billion. Net sales were impacted by approximately $1.6 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations and we benefited $314 million from acquisitions. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.7% to $116.2 billion. The membership and other income increased 12.3% to $800 million primarily driven by a solid 8.1% increase in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club. Therefore coupled with net sales total revenue was $115.7 billion a 1.7% increase over last year. Our growth profit rates for Q3 was 24.5% an increase of 13 basis points compared to last year. The increase was primarily driven by Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart U.S. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 19.8% an increase of eight basis points compared to last year. However this represents a 22 basis point improvement from last quarter, we appreciate our teams across the globe for their collective hard work to reduce expenses. As we do every quarter we will review corporate and support expenses which increased 21.2% and are comprised of three areas. Core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services. Core corporate expenses increased 15.1%, FCPA and compliance related expenses were approximately $69 million which is below our guidance of $75 million to $80 million. Approximately $43 million of these expenses represent a cost incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations. Approximately $26 million is related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements excluding these FCPA and compliance matters core corporate expenses would have increased approximately 10.4% are primarily due to the timing of charitable giving. Remaining areas, global levered services and global e-commerce support selective increased approximately 31.9% for the quarter. As a reminder global levered services includes investments for technology. We continue to invest in the global roll-out of our SAP enterprise systems across our finance, people and merchandising organizations. A little later you will hear more from Charles regarding our global e-commerce investments. This leaves us the consolidated operating income which grew 3.6% to $6.3 billion. On a constant currency basis consolidated operating income was up 5% to $6.4 billion. It is important to note that all three business segments through operating income at a faster rate than sales. Net interest expenses was up 6.2% to $580 million. Though interest expense increased slightly, interest income declined $32 million primarily attributable to the reclassification of certain international accounts payable discounts to cost of sales. That brings us to income from continuing operations attributable to the Walmart of $3.7 billion, an increase of 2.8% over the last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32.5% and Charles will cover our tax guidance for the year. Turning to our balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 4.6% from primarily driven by increases within our U.S. operating segments to support our upcoming holiday plans. Payables as a percentage of inventory was 79% which compares to 85% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of payments and higher inventory balances. Debt to total capitalization was 45.7% at the end of the quarter compared to 43.7% last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher short term debt balances and a slight reduction to shareholders equity. The reduction in equity is principally related to foreign currency translation losses and a fair value adjustment to redeemable non-controlling interest on our balance sheet. During September certain minority interest shareholders in Chile exercised their irrevocable put options to Walmart whereby Walmart\u2019s ownership of Walmart Chile will increase from approximately 75% to approximately 97%. As result of the exercise a redeemable non-controlling interest was mark-to-market on the balance sheet in the third quarter with a corresponding offset to capital in excess of par value. We expect this transaction should be completed in early calendar 2014. Free cash flow was $3.8 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2013 compared to $7 billion last year. Timing of payments associated with taxes and payables as well higher capital expenditures were the primary drivers of the reduction. As Mike and Charles affirmed during the Investor Meeting last month, we have a financial priority to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In Q3, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately 23 million shares of approximately $1.7 billion. This leaves approximately $12.2 billion remaining under our $15 million share repurchase authorization announced in June 2013. Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2013 was 17.5% compared to 18% for the prior year. The decline is principally due to investments in fixed assets, broken working capital and the impact of acquisitions. The U.S. business segments will provide more details regarding the significant additions in net new store and club openings this quarter. Now, Bill will start off the discussion of our operating segments with Walmart U.S. Bill? Jeff Davis : Thank you, Jeff. In the third quarter, we delivered strong profit results in a challenging sales environment. I continue to be impressed by the resilience of our customers and the pace of economic headwinds and fiscal uncertainty and I am proud of our associates for their commitment to managing the business and serving our customers. Net sales grew to $67.7 billion, up approximately $1.6 billion or 2.4%, while comp sales declined 0.3% driven by a 0.4% decline in traffic. Comp traffic was up slightly from second quarter. Operating income increased 5.8% to over $5.1 billion. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of market share gains with an increase of 18 basis points in the measured category of food, consumables and health and wellness OTC during the 13 weeks ending October 26 according to the Nielsen Company. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see strength in produce, home, apparel and wireless. Our focus on improved quality, pricing and brand innovation produced strong sales in these areas. Overall, the quarter started slower than we would have liked. The comp sales picked up in September and October and team aggressively drove value through two mass merchandising events Stock Up and Save and October savings events. These events featured core multi-pack consumables at a great value and helped offset additional consumer noise in the third quarter related to the government shutdown and debt ceiling discussions. As the quarter progressed, we also saw improvement in the more challenging categories of TVs and snacks and beverages. We will continue to drive excitement in value across the store through these kinds of events focusing on key areas and delivering a strong holiday season for our customers. Let me share more details about our financial results for the third quarter. Our gross profit rate was up slightly at 9 basis points with gross profit dollars up 2.7%. This was less than the 23 basis points increase in the second quarter. We continued to strategically invest in price funded by cost of goods savings and expense leverage. Inventory grew 5.1% partly due to aggressive holiday buys. This is down from the 6.9% increase at the end of the second quarter. Our stores and logistics teams again did a great job diligently managing expenses allowing us to deliver strong profit growth and leverage for the quarter. Operating expenses grew only 1.6% to $13.8 billion providing 16 basis points of expense leverage. I am really proud of how we leverage expense. We have a great team and they are generating efficiencies while keeping a close eye on in-stock and customer experience. In fact, our in-stock performance across our three business units is at the highest levels of the year and our customers are telling us their experience at our stores keeps improving. One of our greatest areas of improvement is in our fast scores and it\u2019s indicative of our focus on higher share productivity along with our investment in self-checkouts. Customers continued to tell us the convenience of self-checkouts (Technical Difficulty) and ready for the customer. This has an additional benefit of associates consistently getting more hours versus last year. Before I cover the performance by merchandise area. Let me remind you that the majority of lay away sales are deferred for reporting purchases until the fourth quarter and are not reflecting in the third quarter results discussed here. As we discussed at our investor conference a few weeks ago we\u2019re seeing strong comps in a number of departments with challenging results in areas like dry grocery and entertainment. I\u2019m pleased with the strength of our seasonal business which continues to deliver solid results across the store. The Halloween comp sales were higher than last year mostly driven by strength in candy and costumes. For the quarter our grocery business which includes food and consumables had a low single digit negative comp at 0.7%. Inflation in diary, meat and produce was slightly higher than last year however overall grocery inflation was muted and in-line with last year. I\u2019m pleased with the continued strength in produce and adult beverages which delivered a mid-single digit and high single digit positive comp respectively. I\u2019m also encouraged by the improvement throughout the quarter from our aggressive mass merchandising event. As I mentioned stock up and save in October savings help sales particularly in areas like snacks and beverages, baby consumables and paper product. In fact in carbonated soft drinks, an important traffic driving category, these initiatives helped us gain over 240 basis points of unit share to the 13 weeks ending October 26 according to the Nielsen Company. Throughout the fourth quarter we will be focused on mass merchandising, featured items and special holiday promotions in grocery to help customer stretch their pay checks a little further. Health & Wellness reported a low single digit positive comp which is also an improvement over the prior quarter. Our prescription business delivered a low single digit positive comp now that we have left the majority of the generic drug launches from last year we anticipate less branded generic impact going forward. Comps script counts were essentially flat. Our over the counter business also posted another quarter of low single digit positive comps, the continued sales strength in core categories such as Analgesic, Diabetics, and first aid. Hard-lines including seasonal at a low single digit positive comp. Sporting goods led hard-lines through the mid-single digit positive comp and sales were driven by expanded assortment and outdoor categories such as camping, hunting and fishing. New brands like Bostitch and Hitachi helped the hardware and paint category achieve a low single digit positive comp. Stationary and crafts also had a low single digit positive comp with over 50 basis points of market share gain in stationary for the three months ending September according to the NPD Group. We saw significant market share growth in back to school categories such as writing and activity and notebooks and paper. Entertainment including toys posted a mid-single digit negative comp due to ongoing industry softness and deflation. We made some progress in TVs as we have sharpened our pricing strategy on key brands and improved our offering overcoming share losses in the second quarter. In fact we gained 80 basis points of market share for the three months ending September 2013 according to the NPD Group. We also saw continued strength in wireless and are pleased with the early results of new smartphone and tablet trade-in program. In Toys, the industry faced some challenges as kids are adopting electronics in an early age. However we\u2019re encouraged by a strong finished to the summer season and the early results of our top toys for the holidays. For the first time approximately 1000 kids selected their favorite toys and we have marketed our Chosen by Kids items for holiday. We\u2019ve aggressive plans in toys this holiday season to be the retail destination of assortment and price and we will adjust as necessary to deliver for the customer. Apparel reported a low single digit positive comp; we remained focused on basics and the addition of national brands both of which continue to deliver results. We saw sales improve throughout the quarter in our men\u2019s, ladies, and children\u2019s department due to a strong fall of seasonal assortment. From a brands perspective customers are responding to the quality and value of our apparel, the launch of Avia continues to benefit shoes which finished in the third quarter with an impressive mid-single digit positive comp. We\u2019re also excited about early results of the Russell brand in the men and boys department. Home also reported low single digit positive comp; similar to apparel we\u2019re focused on getting the basics right by adding top national brands. We continue to refine our assortment in bath and bedding and so our comp sales improved throughout the quarter. We also had a mid-single digit positive comps in cooking and dining. National brand such as Farberware, Rachael Ray and the newly launched Calphalon provide our customers with a broad assortment of top merchandize. We\u2019re focused on providing customers with great products at everyday low prices and our domestic manufacturing commitment will help us do more. Since our Made in USA Summit in August, manufacturers have committed to create more than 1,600 jobs here in the U.S. and there are more than 150 active projects underway. Together with our suppliers, we have announced new facilities to supply toys and home and apparel items, which will help our customers and our communities by adding quality jobs. As we discussed during our investor conference last month, we have a robust real estate strategy to further strengthen customer access and market share across the country. In the third quarter, we open 54 supercenters, including new stores, expenses, relocations and conversions. Supercenters remained a strong growth vehicle for us as we focused on opportunities to reinforce our brand position within core markets. We also continue to accelerate our small format opening 32 neighborhood market and an additional express store during the quarter. I am excited by the consistent performance of our neighborhood market fleet, that\u2019s delivered a comp of approximately 3.4% for the third quarter. We saw continued strength in our fresh departments, particularly in produce and meat along with the adult beverages and key consumable categories. In addition, our focus on pharmacy has driven consistent growth with notably stronger prescription accounts in new stores. The strength of our neighborhood market results is an indication of the unique combination of convenience, price and quality this format provides. Walmart Express Stores continued to deliver solid results. We continue to refine this format and we are encouraged about the role they can play in the future as we look to fill in and expand our presence in core markets. For the third quarter, Walmart added 7.1 million net new square feet across the country. In the fourth quarter, we planned to open about 50 stores, including new stores expansions, relocations and conversions. These will be comprised of both large and small formats and represent approximately 3.7 million incremental square feet. Each of our formats is rapidly converging with our digital platforms for the continued development of programs like Ship from Store, Scan and Go, Lockers and more. We are focused on innovative ways to serve the customer like the grocery delivery test, which we recently expanded in Denver. To complement these programs, we are expanding our endless isle giving our customers the ability to shop anytime and anywhere. We have more than doubled our online assortment over the last year going from 2 million SKUs to more than 5 million primarily driven by marketplace growth. We are also investing in our digital platform, building fulfillment facilities to further enable convergence, improve shipping speed and drive supply chain efficiencies. As Mike said, we are geared up and ready to serve our customers in the fourth quarter. The team has developed what I believe to be our best holiday plan ever. Starting in November with Thanksgiving and all the way through January, we are committed to being the number one retail destination for customers. We invested heavily in marketing this year to ensure everyone hears our message. We will have the number one share of voice each week of the season with approximately 25 billion impressions this year. We are making through ourselves are well-stocked with the most popular toys and we are guaranteeing low prices all season in the store for the Christmas Ad Match program. We also launched holiday specials on walmart.com a month earlier than last year and are offering free shipping on the basket of $50 and more. Our customers across the country continue to take advantage of our free layaway program with no opening fees. CDs, tablets and videogame consoles are the top items on layaway. What\u2019s really exciting is our Black Friday plan. As always, we will have great prices on key items across the store, including nearly seven times the number of one hour guarantee items compared to last year. This exciting program guarantees our shoppers access for the most popular items of the season at our Black Friday prices, while other retailers may have limited quantities as long as you are in our stores during the event times we guarantee you will get one. On Monday, we shared publicly many of the items in our Black Friday event. So let me highlight a few. Some of the top guarantee items include a 32-inch LED TV for $98, the 16-gigabyte iPad Mini Wi-Fi for $299 with $100 Walmart gift card and Furby Boom for $29. It will also be the exclusive destination for several new products. Black Friday at our stores will become a full weekend of excitement and value across all departments. And we are making it easier than ever for our customers. We will be enhancing the in-store towing process for the one hour guarantee items by distributing wristbands. So customers can shop the entire store instead of waiting in the line for one item. Also the Black Friday held at walmart.com will be the shoppers\u2019 number one source for all shopping tips, maps and item research. Not to mention, there will be exciting offers both in stores and online for Cyber Monday, a truly integrated experience. We know our holiday plans wouldn\u2019t be possible without the work of our associates. I\u2019m inspired by their dedication and confident in their ability to execute in the fourth quarter. With a special focus on career opportunities and to appreciate our associates for their hard work, members of the leadership team recently surprised several store associates with on the spot promotions across the country. This is an exciting time for the associates and a great opportunity for us to remind our teams in the stores that the company is in best year [ph] of success. We\u2019re product that we promote more than a 160,000 associates this year, the jobs with higher responsibility and pay. We have robust plans in place to help our customer save money this holiday season. But we\u2019re somewhat encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter we know the customer continues to be challenged by ongoing uncertainty around healthcare cost. The payroll tax increased and recent SNAP reductions. Based on these factors we\u2019re currently forecasting a relatively flat comp in the fourth quarter for the 14 weeks ending January 31 of 2014 according to our five retail calendar, last year\u2019s 14 week comp was up 0.3%. With that we move to international, Doug? Doug McMillon : Thanks Bill. Let\u2019s talk about international\u2019s overall results and then I will move on to a discussion of our 6th largest market. As Jeff covered we had significant impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales. We had 0.2% increase in net sales achieving $33.1 billion, on a constant currency basis net sales were $34.4 billion up 4.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $1.6 billion and our Yihaodian acquisition in China added $314 million in sales. Our gross profit rate, on a reported basis was relatively flat to last year. On a constant currency basis, it increased 28 basis points driven by rate improvements primarily in the UK and Mexico. We\u2019re committed to leveraging expenses and continue to work on our goal of reducing spending to a rate that is in-line with slower sales. As we covered in our recent investor conference we also continue to deal with the headwinds of wage inflation, and higher indirect taxes. We also continue to make investments in e-commerce. Operating expenses increased 0.5% and 5% on a constant currency basis. So you can see we made progress on the absolute expense dollar growth but the softness in sales hurt our ability to leverage. Operating income increased 1.7% to $1.5 billion and improved 8% on a constant currency basis to $1.5 billion also. I\u2019m proud of our team for delivering that 8% increase in the slow growth sales environment. Inventory was up 2.6% compared to sales growth of 0.2%, on a constant currency basis inventory grew 7.6% on sales growth of 4.1%. Inventory days on hand were well managed in Canada, Brazil and Japan. You will recall that on October 15th, we covered several actions to improve our operational effectiveness. We had announced in September the pending sale of our VIPS Restaurants in Mexico. We also made the decision to independently run our 20 unit cash and carry business in India and end our joint venture with Bharti and we announced the closure of approximately 50 underperforming stores in Brazil and China. As Jeff mentioned earlier this is now reflected in our third quarter results as discounted operations and we expect the sales to finalize in the fourth quarter. We expect the net result of ending our India joint venture and store closure decisions will be reflected in our financial results in the fourth quarter. Both this and India transactions require regulatory approval. As Jeff also mentioned certain minority shareholders in Chile exercised their put options and Walmart will buy the corresponding shares increasing our ownership of Walmart Chile to approximately 97%. This transaction is still not complete but we\u2019re excited about our business in Chile and our increase in ownership. Let\u2019s turn to the results by market, the following discussion is on a constant currency basis and unless other stated net sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal calendar basis. In all countries except Brazil and China our stores and e-commerce businesses are integrated and led by the same management teams. Therefore our discussion of results is about the total operation. For Brazil and China we will provide insights on the stores and e-commerce separately. The UK economy experienced some green shoots during the third quarter with GDP growth of 0.8%, up slightly from Q2. However, customers continued to feel pressure on the family budgets. The latest adds the income tracker issued on October 18 showed costs of essential food and household items growing at 2.8% well ahead of wage growth of 0.8%. Growth within the grocery channel was driven entirely by price inflation with negative unit growth. According to Kantar\u2019s data, as the market share declined by 40 basis points for the 12 weeks ended October 13, total market growth for the 12 weeks ended October 13 was 3%. Net sales increased 3% and sales, excluding fuel, were up 2.4%. Comparable sales grew 0.7% excluding fuel driven by an increasing traffic of 1.4% but offset by a ticket decline of 0.7%. Gross profit rates increased 48 basis points due to improved efficiency and sourcing through our IPO and GAAP businesses and reduced non-food markdowns. As noted in the first half of this fiscal year, property taxes and insurance continued to pressure expenses. However, our we operate for less program helps offset some of those pressures. Operating expenses grew only slightly ahead of sales at 3.2%. Operating income grew faster than sales at 13.2%. We maintained our focus on driving EDLP and price leadership and has the essentials and produce while investing further in rollbacks for seasonal fresh items, such as salads and vegetables. As a result, we drove share across these categories and maintained our overall food price inflation at roughly half that of the market. Online sales were up more than 15%. We significantly increased capacity rolling at 120 additional click and collect sites to 218 stores representing almost half of our total events. In addition, we launched the delivery pass during Q3, which allows a customer to receive a free delivery of one order of grocery or general merchandise per day. We also continued to make a difference in our communities and we are recognized by winning the Community Retailer of the Year award at the 2013 Retail Industry Award. In addition, we continue to support efforts to fight hunger by expanding our fair share program mentioned in our Q2 call. Our program was extended to all 17 of Asda\u2019s chilled warehouses and all chilled suppliers. More than 1,000 local charities are benefiting from this program to fight hunger. In Canada, our net sales grew 3.8% benefiting from last year\u2019s record expansion program. Operating income grew 3.6% slightly slower than sales due to our investments in new stores and our rapidly growing e-commerce business. Comparable sales decreased 1.3%, with ticket up 0.2% and traffic down 1.5%. We had strong comp sales in food and consumables, but continued to see softer sales in entertainment as industry specific challenges persist. In the Nielsen Company, measured categories of food and consumables reinforcing the strength of our supercenter food business. Warmer weather in September and early October negatively impacted sales and hardlines and apparel. Gross profit rate decreased as we continued to invest in price for our customers. We have realized increased (Technical Difficulty) Canada leveraged operating expenses by 6 basis points through EDLC initiatives focused on supply chain and operations productivity. Walmart Canada\u2019s website offers primarily general merchandise with an emphasis on heritage categories, including home, apparel, electronics and hardlines. Information about our fresh food selection available in our supercenters is also provided. Walmart Canada offers shipping to home and in the majority of cases it is proved. We are pleased with the results of our e-commerce business in Canada. During the quarter, traffic was up 42% and sales up 96% over the prior year. During the quarter, we completed four supercenter expansions and six in-box conversions. We now operate 380 stores across all Canadian provinces with 227 supercenters and 153 discount stores. Included in these projects were four new supercenters in Atlantic Canada as we continue to bring our one-stop shopping offer to Eastern Canada. Now, let\u2019s take a moment to discuss Africa. As you know Massmart is a publicly held subsidiary that operates in 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The fiscal year ends in December and the company will release their year-end results in February 2014. I just got back from spending last week in South Africa and I continue to be excited about the Massmart business. We have a strong, deep management team abreast of relevant formats and room to grow. The environment in South Africa remains challenging in the short term with high-end employment, rising utility rates and tighter consumer credits. But our team continues to take steps to make the business even stronger for the future in food and general merchandise for example during my visit I saw our first small pilot of George baby apparel and our macro units in Johannesburg. Now let\u2019s take a look at Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America, and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported third-quarter results on October 23 under IFR so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. As I mentioned Walmex announced on September 10th that they had reached a definitive agreement with Alsea under which Alsea will acquire 100% of the restaurant division of Walmex. A closing of the transaction is still subject to approval of regulatory authorities. This quarter the result of our VIPs business were reported as discontinued operations. For the quarter consolidated net sales grew 2.2% led by Central America. Gross profit rate increased by 49 basis points driven by increases in both Mexico and Central America. In Central America the gross margin improvement was driven by both EDLC and EDLP execution. The consolidated operating expenses deleveraged 12 basis points. Operating income grew 6.3% faster than sales primarily due to strong gross profit margin. Mexico's sales increased 1.7% over the last year and comparable store sales decreased 2.8% negatively impacted by the country's economic slowdown. Ticket was up 0.4% and traffic was down 3.2%. In the third quarter (indiscernible) had comparable store sales excluding Walmex decreased 2.2% while our self-service and Sam's Club comps declined 2.8% and 1.6% without Sam's Club. In Mexico gross margin rate was up 30 basis points. Operating expenses grew 1.9% only slightly higher than sales as we worked to offset expense growth with productivity initiatives and disciplined expense management. Operating income increased 5.8% growing faster than sales. Given the current consumption slowdown in Mexico our focus is on reinforcing our price leadership by driving simplicity, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. We continue to focus on bending the cost curve in Mexico were over the same quarter last year we improved case productivity in our distribution centers by 3.9%, labor productivity and our stores about 4.1% and decreased energy usage at comparable-stores by 4.2%. Central America, increased net sales from the previous year by 4.8%, comparable store sales grew 1.1%. Gross profit rate increased 1.6% versus last year, driven by our investments in distribution and integration of Walmart systems. Expenses deleveraged 60 basis points growing faster than sales. We're focused on maintaining an adequate price gap in each country and format increasing productivity and controlling expenses is a top priority. Operating income increased 17.9%. Moving onto Brazil third-quarter net sales grew 6.9% with comp sales up 4.7%. Average ticket grew 8.8% and traffic declined 4.1%. Gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points and operating expenses grew faster than sales deleveraging 14 basis points. We reported an operating loss for the quarter. We continue to invest in price and systems integration in both retail and wholesale formats. We\u2019re pleased with the growth of e-commerce sales in Brazil where we now average 12 million monthly visitors. Our Brazilian website was voted the top e-commerce site, E-Bit who also awarded the Blue Diamond Award to us for the third year in a row. We expect to add one million SKUs by the end of the year. After updating the site last month, page views are up 40% since the update. Customer spends more time on the site. Overall, sales were up more than 50% versus this time last year. Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release third quarter earnings on November 29. Now, let\u2019s move on to Asia. Walmart China grew sales 2%. During the past 12 months, we opened 17 net new stores bringing our total store count to 401. We continued to focus on being the clear price leader in China by lowering expenses through our supply chain and our worry free pricing initiative. Worry free is the best English translation to describe how we are communicating our EDLP transition pickup. Comparable sales were negative 0.9%. Comp ticket grew 7.1% in China while traffic declined 8% as the customer behavior shift towards fewer trips continued in the third quarter. Our growth was slightly below the market compared to modern retail. Yet according to the Nielsen Company, we outperform the hypermarket segment for the quarter. Through our ongoing decentralization program, we continued to buy for less a portion of these savings was reinvested and priced and a portion into profitability resulting in our gross margin rate increasing the 61 basis points. China did not leverage operating expenses for the third quarter, but operating income was up over 90% growing faster than sales. While within China in October, we announced that we will open approximately 110 new stores between now and the end of 2016. While we are growing, we are also dealing with a number of store locations that are not performing at acceptable levels. Yihaodian continues to be one of China\u2019s fastest growing e-commerce sites covering both grocery and general merchandise. We won a Cannes Media Lions Award for the Yihaodian 2.0 app. We continue to leverage the sourcing opportunities with Walmart\u2019s global network everything from Asda milk to Danish cookies. In fact, Yihaodian is now selling over 90,000 units of imported milk per day. Japan continues to be a challenging retail environment. Net sales increased 1.2% and we delivered positive comp sales. The first comp increased since the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Average ticket was up 2% and traffic was down 1.9%. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, overall supermarket comparable sales for the third quarter declined 1%, indicating that Walmart continues to outperform the market. To restrict expense management, we gained efficiencies in our supply chain and store labor productivity and leveraged operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Gross profit rate increased 73 basis points versus last year. Operating income was slightly positive compared to a loss last year. We continue to be excited about our iconic \u00a585 pricing equivalent to dollar pricing and we will continue this program through the end of the year. Our Japanese customers continued to appreciate our EDLP position in the market and we continue to invest in price to keep our competitive advantage. We continue to grow within international and I am pleased to report that we added 3.3 million net square feet this quarter moving to our goal of 14 million additional square feet this fiscal year. As an international division, we continued to invest in compliance in every country in which we operate, we are focused on improving processes, increasing training and strengthening leadership. We view compliance as a foundational issue that strengthens customer confidence, which in turn supports business growth and serves as another competitive advantage to help people save money and live better. The fourth quarter is well underway for our markets. The slow growth macroeconomic environment is persisting through the first month of this quarter and the markets continue to be competitive. Expense leverage will be difficult as sales growth continues to be challenging. We will manage our cost dollars well and stay focused on growing sales to give ourselves the opportunity to leverage. We also remain committed to growing our e-commerce business drastically. Now, I will turn it over to Ross for an update on the Sam\u2019s Club business. Ross? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks Doug. At Sam\u2019s Club, we continued to deliver superior member value driving strong membership income and profit growth. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter results especially our positive comp sales and steady increase in traffic. I would like to take a moment to cover the highlights of the quarter before discussing our financial results. During the third quarter members notice our merchandise transformation. There was a great deal of excitement and itself that translated into traffic and sales. Our merchants are bringing in great new items at exceptional values and our operators are making the merchandise come to life with inviting displays. I'm pleased with this merchandising evolution which will continue both in club and online. We remain satisfied with the investments we\u2019ve made in price leadership as well as our strategy to provide differentiated merchandise and to accelerate our club opening. These investments will continue to strengthen our topline results going forward. We have ramped up our new club opening sharpening our focus on new member acquisition. In Q3 we opened 13 new and relocated clubs the greatest number of clubs opened during one quarter within the past few years. I attended several grand openings, and it's clear that both member and associate excitement levels are high. Many of our new clubs are exceeding sales expectations based on the strength of the new club member acquisitions such as helping generate early momentum and driving traffic. We strive to be the overall price leader in the club channel for consistently low prices and strategic price investment. Our instant savings program is one form of price investment allowing us to provide additional value with special offers that are above and beyond our normal members only prices. In Q3 members received one instant savings book valid from August 28th through September 22nd that included more than $4500 in saving. These savings are automatically loaded on to every member\u2019s card. The books are bringing members into categories previously not shopped and some of these members have continued shopping these category after the event. Now let\u2019s discuss third quarter results. Sam\u2019s Club generated a comp of 1.1% without fuel for the 13 week retail sales period. Comp traffic grew 2.4% and comp ticket (indiscernible) by 1.3% driven by softness in our tobacco business. Both business and savings members posted positive traffic this quarter with growth primarily coming from our savings members. Net sales including fuel were $14.1 billion up 1.1% over last year. Fuel prices decreased 7.7% and gallon sold were up 2% creating a burden to overall sales of 1%. Sam\u2019s gross profit rate increased 26 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 31 basis points. Operating income increased 9.2% to $474 million. Inventory including fuel grew 6.3% during the third quarter, significantly less than this time last year. New club growth, strategic builds for our instant savings events and holiday merchandise inflated our inventory position while sell through of summer inventory was in line with expectations. Volatility and fuel prices can influence our financial results. Therefore the remainder of our discussion is focused on our core business, excluding fuel for comparative purposes. Net sales for the quarter were $12.4 billion up 2.1% from last year. Comps remain positive across all divisions with performance led by the mid-Atlantic and South-West regions. Retail inflation across the club excluding fuel was essentially flat compared to 70 to 100 basis points last year. If you exclude both fuel and tobacco our business was actually deflationary. Now let\u2019s discuss the merchandising highlights of the quarter. (Indiscernible) low single-digit sales comp. In Fresh, mid-single digit comp growth was partially offset by disinflation within freezer cooler. In Gourmet Deli and Home Meal solutions our professional chefs have developed new gourmet items like Chicken Marsala and Lobster Ravioli. Members love these delicious entrees which are helping to list comp and unit growth mid-single digits. Grocery and beverage reported a low single-digit comp. The introduction of new products within our snacks category such Brownie braille and Greek yogurt drizzled popcorn benefited dry grocery sales. Within beverages, craft beers and high-end spirits are performing well. In our adult beverage Instant Savings program now in 11 eight is driving awareness and sales. Consumables had a low single-digit comp. During the Instant Savings event, we gained 60 basis points of share in tabletop according to the Nielsen Group for this four-week period ending September 28, 2013. Tobacco sales were essentially flat this quarter in line with prior quarters. Technology and entertainment posted a mid-single-digit negative comp. In August, we hosted a successful VIP event rewarding our plus members of exceptional values on great items. Solid event performance was not enough to offset deflationary pressures in electronic. However, member response to our new extreme value gift card program has been very well received. The program includes both nationally branded and locally relevant third-party gift cards for outlets like restaurants and movie theaters all at a significant value. Continued momentum in home and apparel driven by a more robust offering led to a mid-single-digit comp sales increase. Back-to-school, back-to-college and fall merchandise enabled us to have a faster to the quarter. Apparel and jewelry posted double-digit comp and unit growth driven by differentiations, new brands in trend-right items. Health and wellness, including pharmacy continued its sales momentum with the mid single-digit comps. We recently moved our immunizations program in-house training and certifying our pharmacists to administer a range of shots and to provide a more holistic health and wellness experience. Pharmacy sales remained solid with pharmacy script volumes increasing. E-commerce traffic continues to grow at a double-digit rate increased mobile web and app usage. We remain focused on integrating our physical and digital resources providing a deeper relationship with members. For example, we recently enhanced a special order tire experience on samsclub.com. This service lets members order tires from our broad online assortment and have them shipped and installed at the club of their choice. This reverse showrooming service is enabling a seamless experience both in club and online at a significant value for our members. Now, let\u2019s continue with the financial results, excluding fuel. Gross profit rate increased 16 basis points driven primarily by merchandise mix shifts. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 23 basis points due in part to our increased investment in pre-opening expenses associated with the 13 club openings and a state excise tax refund credit we received last year. Membership and other income grew 16.9%. In other income, we realized a financial benefit from a profit-sharing arrangement with our credit card provider as new account growth and existing account performance were both above last year. Membership income grew 8.1%, up from 4% last quarter as the benefit of the fee increase implemented earlier this year accelerates. The benefit will continue to be a tailwind in the upcoming quarter and throughout the next fiscal year. In terms of membership, our primary base continues to grow driven by strong finance performance in the new clubs opened this quarter, plus renewals and upgrades also showed strength partially offset by soft business member sing-ups. Sam\u2019s third quarter operating income grew to $466 million, an increase of 9.4% over last year. I would like to transition to our strategy to enhance new club productivity. By increasing our upfront membership acquisition investment, we have been able to build a critical mass of members. In some cases, we have opened new clubs with a member base well beyond our average size. We have customized the approach by market to incorporate regionally relevant road shows and incredible one-time buys creating plenty of pre-opening buys. Throughout each club first year, we are engaging extensively with these new members demonstrating value and encouraging renewals. Given these results, we are accelerating this strategy to protect share in competitive markets while also investing in densely populated areas. During the fourth quarter, we planned to open two new clubs and one relocated club. At Sam\u2019s Club, the holiday season is well underway and we\u2019re investing in price for the fourth quarter. First our members will be rewarded with two instant savings books and an exclusive VIP events for our plus members at Sunday before Thanksgiving. Second, we've collaborated with the global e-commerce team to provide the best online program we've ever had. Finally in December alone, we will transition our club three times providing members with more than double the number of new general merchandise items versus last year before. Before I close I want to thank the entire Sam\u2019s team. We\u2019ve recently empowered our buyers to make more calculated risk. Their focus on newness and excitement has transformed our merchandise assortment. We have also invested to further develop our operators through the next generation leadership program. We\u2019re identifying and building talent in the field to serve our members and their community. Together our merchants and operators form a critical piece of the business, and I'm confident their efforts will translate into a great holiday season for our members. I hope to visit our clubs this holiday season. We have a comprehensive plan to finish the year and expect to deliver a club comp sales increase excluding fuel, a flat to 2% for the 14 week ending January 31, 2014. For the comparable 14 week period last year comp sales excluding fuel increased 1.8%. Looking towards the future we are excited about the long-term position of Sam's Club. We remain committed to delivering superior value to our members, through differentiated merchandise anytime, anywhere access and a compelling experience. With that I'd like to turn the program over to Charles. Charles Holley : Thanks Ross. Last quarter I told you that our expectations for the back half of the year would be through a lens of cautious consumer spending and I believe that we\u2019re seeing that play out. In the third quarter we invested strategically in price across all of our segments and we made progress on expense leverage. Although it was a challenging quarter from a self-standpoint, we\u2019re encouraged that we continue to manage our business well and deliver consistent, solid returns for our shareholders. On the quarter, we added approximately $1.8 billion of consolidated net sales. On a constant currency basis we would have increased net sales by more than $3 billion, currency exchange rate fluctuations against the U.S. dollar have clearly been a headwind for us this year and if foreign currency rates remain where they are today I expect a similar impact for the fourth quarter. Around the world the company added approximately 11.7 million net new square feet of retail space during the quarter, bringing our net year-to-date additional square footage to 22.7 million. We\u2019re also pleased with the growth of our smaller formats in Walmart U.S. In fact we have close to 400 neighborhood markets by year-end. Our e-commerce growth was extremely strong, during the quarter we increased sales by almost 40% due in part to last year's acquisition of Yihaodian in China. Without Yihaodian we still grew global e-commerce sales by over 20%. The investments we\u2019re making or generating additional site traffic and sales particularly in our key e-commerce market of U.S., UK, Brazil and China. We expanded our fulfillment network around the world, including new facilities in Texas, Brazil and China across our four websites @WalmartLabs team made significant advances in personalization by building a new sophisticated recommendation engine that is a big leap forward from where we were previously. Our goal is to have a robust product offerings for our customers in every market and we continue to add assortment both through the core businesses and through our marketplace partners. The team also dramatically accelerated the deployment of Pangea, our global technology platform that runs every site around the world. This allows us to enhance the site experience by regularly releasing both the front end and back end capabilities. As we enter the fourth quarter it's important to note that we are laser focused on improving top sales in every segment and through our e-commerce channel. Now let's turn to leverage, as you heard from Jeff we made progress and expense leverage on a consolidated basis since the second quarter. While Walmart U.S. continues to lead the company and operating expense leverage. We\u2019re encouraged by the overall progress of international. Given the soft sales environment and our increased investments in e-commerce and compliance, we know that expense leverage for the company will be challenging for the full year. Two years ago, we committed to levering 100 basis points of our expense to sales ratio by fiscal year 2017. We made progress on this goal last fiscal year and while the road got a little bumpy this year, we remain committed to this goal. Moving on to returns. Our goal is to grow operating income at the same rate or faster than sales. And in the third quarter, we delivered on that objective. Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flow of over $13 billion and free cash flow is now at $3.8 billion. The company returned $10.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases so far this year clearly reinforcing our commitment to deliver solid returns to shareholders. Now, let\u2019s move on to guidance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our earnings guidance today assumes several important factors. First, we anticipate continued pressure on sales as consumers face tough economic conditions around the world and the competition remains aggressive for every holiday purchased. Second, we anticipate that currency exchange rates remain at current levels meaning a continued negative impact on sales and profits. Next, our full year effective tax rate remains unchanged with our prior forecast and will range between 31% and 33%. Fourth, we expect the incremental impact of investments and global e-commerce to be approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.10 per share for the full year. And last, expenses related to FCPA matters, including our compliance program enhancements and the ongoing investigations will be between $75 million and $80 million in the fourth quarter. Taking these factors into account, we are forecasting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 to range between $1.50 and $1.60. This range includes two items that I mentioned at the October Analyst Meeting. First, we are closing approximately 50 underperforming stores in Brazil and China. The impact of these closures will be dilutive to earnings per share from continuing operations by about $0.06. Second, the company will independently own and operate the wholesale format in India and will end its franchise agreement with Bharti for the retail business. This transaction is still subject to regulatory approval. We expect the impact to be in the fourth quarter and to be dilutive to earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately $0.04. Therefore, underlying diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter is expected to be $1.60 to $1.70. The last item I mentioned is the sale of our VIPS restaurants in Mexico, which is scheduled for the fourth quarter pending regulatory approval. The expected gain on this transaction will be accretive to earnings per share from discontinued operations by approximately $0.06. Now, when we look at the combination of all of these items, we believe diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart for the fourth quarter which takes into account the sale of VIPS and discontinued operations will range between $1.56 and $1.66. Let\u2019s move on to guidance for the full year. We are updating our guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 to a range between $5.01 and $5.11. Accounting for the $0.10 of certain items that will impact the fourth quarter, our underlying full year earnings per share from continuing operations will range between $5.11 and $5.21. Thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. On behalf of the management team and our 2.2 million associates, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a merry Christmas, happy holidays and a healthy New Year.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the fourth quarter and full year results of fiscal 2014. The date of this call is February 20, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way.  This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call. Our press release and transcript are available on our corporate website \u2013 stock.walmart.com. Please also note that we have two additional releases out this morning. One release announces our annual dividend for fiscal 2015, and a second details our small store expansion strategy in Walmart U.S. for this fiscal year.  As a reminder, for fiscal 2014 which ended Jan. 31, 2014, we utilized a 53-week comp reporting calendar, with the 53rd week being included in the Q4 reporting period. Back in our Q3 earnings release, we provided you with an adjusted fiscal year 2013 Q4 14-week comp for comparability to our Q4 comp guidance for this fiscal year. Our Q4 reporting period began on Oct. 26, 2013 and ran through Jan. 31, 2014. Consistent with industry practice, we will not adjust the reported fiscal 2014 comps. Therefore, for this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based upon 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We have posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the investor portion of our website.  In case you missed it, Walmart issued a pre-release about fourth quarter earnings on Friday, Jan. 31. That release updated EPS guidance, and included comments on comp sales performance. We refer to that release a number of times during this call. It\u2019s also available on the website. In this quarter we have significant discussion about underlying performance. Underlying EPS \u2013 by Walmart standards \u2013 is calculated to adjust for the impact on the company\u2019s reported EPS for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of certain discrete items that totaled $0.26 per share and that occurred in the fourth quarter. Additional information regarding this term \u2013 underlying EPS \u2013 and others used in today\u2019s release including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are also available on our website.  One last reminder : As many of you know, on Monday, February 24, we will co-host our annual international meeting for the investment community with Walmex in Mexico City. For those of you unable to join us, the meeting will be webcast in both English and Spanish, and can be accessed via the investor portion of our corporate website, as well as the Walmex site.  So, now let\u2019s get down to our agenda for today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, who took over Feb. 1 as president and CEO of Wal- Mart Stores, Inc. will cover key results and provide an overall assessment of our strengths as he leads us into fiscal 2015. 3 Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP of finance and treasurer, in her first call as Walmart\u2019s treasurer, will cover the financial details for both the fourth quarter and the full year.  Then, we\u2019ll cover the operating segments. Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., followed by David Cheesewright, who succeeded Doug as president and CEO of Walmart International on Feb.1. Rosalind Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, will follow Dave. Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of how we did on our financial priorities of growth, leverage & returns, and as always, he\u2019ll cover guidance.  Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our new CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off our call. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to share with you how excited and humbled I am to serve as the CEO of Walmart. It\u2019s truly an honor to lead this company and serve our associates. We have a dedicated team of associates around the world who work hard every day to deliver on our purpose. As I complete my third week in this role, I appreciate the support from Mike and the leadership team on carrying out a smooth transition. Being part of Walmart for over 23 years gives me some perspective and appreciation of the past, but most of all, I\u2019m excited about our future.  Now, let\u2019s get to the business of today. On a consolidated basis, Walmart\u2019s underlying EPS rose 2.0% for the full year to $5.11, including the fourth quarter\u2019s EPS of $1.60. On a reported basis, EPS for fiscal 2014 decreased 3.2% to $4.85, including $1.34 in the fourth quarter. Claire will cover the details behind our EPS shortly. 4  Our company added $11.9 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis this year to reach more than $477 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year. This excludes the negative impact of more than $5 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations and an approximately $730 million benefit from acquisitions. While we made operational adjustments to lower our expense base, they were not sufficient to deliver leverage for the full year.  Consolidated underlying operating income rose 0.2%, but on a reported basis, operating income decreased 3.1% for the year. Walmart U.S. was a key contributor to our overall profit growth, with operating income up 4%.  Walmart U.S. also added almost $5 billion in annual net sales. We were encouraged by our comp performance in the first half of the fourth quarter, including the holiday period. But, like many other retailers, weather got the best of us throughout the back half, resulting in a fourth quarter period comp decrease of 0.4%. It\u2019s a credit to Bill and his team that Walmart U.S. leveraged expenses and invested in price for our customers. Sam\u2019s Club had the strongest annual membership income growth in many years, driven primarily by the fee increase. But, net sales grew more slowly than expected. Roz and the team have taken steps to rebalance Sam\u2019s operational structure and enhance merchandise offerings. We expect these actions to provide a foundation for future growth and further benefit our fiscal 2015 financial results.  Walmart International delivered solid constant currency net sales growth to reach almost $141 billion, including more than $39 billion of constant currency net sales in the fourth quarter. The team improved operational efficiencies to lower expenses and reduce inventory, and this will continue to be a priority.  I\u2019m pleased to have Dave Cheesewright leading Walmart International. Since joining the Walmart family over 15 years ago, Dave has been instrumental in strengthening our business, as well as gaining market share in our international markets. I\u2019ve seen Dave make tough strategic decisions to better position us for long-term success, and I\u2019m confident that his leadership will serve associates, customers and shareholders well.  Each operating segment strengthened its e-commerce platforms, and customers responded, driving annual Global eCommerce sales above the $10-billion mark, a 30% increase, including sales from our Yihaodian acquisition. We know that technology is changing how customers around the world shop, and we are changing with them. Under Neil\u2019s leadership and with company-wide support, we will continue to invest in this area that is critical to our success.  I\u2019d like to spend my remaining time with you outlining what I see as Walmart\u2019s strengths that we will further capitalize on, and the areas that make me so excited about our company\u2019s future. One of Sam Walton\u2019s fundamental principles that I really like is that we need to serve Walmart customers around the globe as if they\u2019re our boss, because they are. Listening to our customers and exceeding their expectations are the keys to our success. I will lead Walmart with a customer-centric focus.  I am working with the leadership team on enhancing the business to improve our customer relevance. We have a compelling customer proposition, but we can get better at running some of our core operations, and we will.  Walmart has a long history of embracing change. And this year, we\u2019ll certainly make some changes to improve our business. These changes will be made with a filter on increasing customer relevance. Customers\u2019 shopping habits are changing more rapidly than ever before. We must be more nimble and flexible as we operate our businesses to adapt to these changes. So, our focus is to invest in the capabilities that connect with customers on their terms.  We can accomplish this by accelerating our growth across the enterprise. This includes delivering improved comp sales by sharpening our EDLP focus and increasing merchandise innovation to drive more traffic. Comp sales improvement is a key priority, and we\u2019ll use a combination of price investment and enhanced service to accomplish this.  We will also continue to get closer to our customers and provide them with additional shopping options. In the U.S., we see a great opportunity to accelerate our small format store rollout to complement Walmart\u2019s core supercenter fleet. Customers want this convenience, and they are responding by driving strong comps at existing small formats. You\u2019ll hear more from Bill about this shortly.  We also see an environment to create transformative growth in Global eCommerce and mobile commerce. Our ability to combine online and mobile with the assets of the world\u2019s largest retailer positions us to win at the intersection of physical and digital retail, which is a competitive advantage.  Over the past year in particular, we have invested more significantly to improve our customer experience and fulfillment capacity. Cycle times on e-commerce related to capital investments are much more fluid than those for stores, so we can move faster and make decisions with speed. We\u2019ll increase our e-commerce investment as opportunities present themselves. And, we\u2019re committed to updating you more often on this important growth area.  Another area of focus is on operating with excellence. I am a firm believer in EDLP, because it builds customers\u2019 trust in Walmart. EDLP is a competitive advantage, and we will continue to transition the rest of our international markets to this pricing strategy. With EDLC, we can lower our cost structure so we can pass on savings to customers. Our operational excellence mindset compels us to deliver expense leverage by growing sales and driving the productivity loop. We\u2019ll also improve our capital efficiency in our core business and foster an environment that leverages best practices.  Our goal is to become the model of excellence in global compliance and ethics, and we\u2019ve made significant progress on this commitment during the year. We also will continue to lead on social and environmental issues that build public trust with key stakeholders. I\u2019m proud that Walmart enables and empowers associates with opportunities to succeed. My career is testament to this. I\u2019m also grateful for the opportunity I was given, starting as an hourly associate, to learn the business and what it takes to be a good merchant. And of course, we never stop learning.  In fact, when I was riding along with one of our trucks delivering a load to a supercenter on my first day as CEO, the driver, Rickey, displayed a personal passion for serving customers. I saw that same passion from Rosie, one of our department managers, in a Memphis store last week. I was reminded how each of us, regardless of our roles at Walmart, has an important responsibility to serve our customers to the best of our abilities.  And because of this, we will continue to invest in and develop talent that will move us into the future. This is really critical to our success. Before I close, I want to appreciate Mike Duke for his service and accomplishments as CEO over the past 5 years and throughout his 18-year career with Walmart. Mike was instrumental in positioning Walmart for long-term success by making critical investments in technology and talent. He also broadened our company\u2019s commitment to lead on some of the most pressing social and environmental issues of our times. Under Mike\u2019s leadership, the company delivered strong financial results, and total shareholder returns improved dramatically.  Without question, Mike\u2019s passion for retail and drive for continuous improvement has benefitted Walmart\u2019s associates, customers and shareholders. As you\u2019ve heard these past few minutes, we have much to achieve this year, and this will inevitably include change. But things that won\u2019t change include our core beliefs, our winning culture and our purpose of serving customers so that they can save money and have the freedom to do more with their hard earned money.  I\u2019m confident in our very strong leadership team and our more than 2 million associates to deliver for Walmart\u2019s customers, shareholders and each other. I\u2019m honored to lead this incredible company and optimistic about our future. In this changing retail environment, Walmart will lead.  Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire? Claire Babineaux-Fontenot:  Thank you, Doug. I\u2019ll begin by going through our fourth quarter P&L results and wrap up with a summary of our full year.  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.34, compared to $1.67 last year. On January 31, we updated EPS guidance, including details on a number of discrete items, which impacted our fourth quarter results.  The total EPS impact of these discrete items on continuing operations for the quarter and the year was $0.26 per share. A detailed explanation for each of these items is indicated within today\u2019s press release. The discrete items and the respective EPS impact were as follows : Brazil non-income tax contingencies $0.06, Brazil employment claim contingencies $0.05, Brazil and China store closures $0.06, China store lease expense charges $0.03, India transaction $0.05, Sam\u2019s Club U.S. staff restructuring & club closure $0.01 Therefore, our underlying EPS \u2013 meaning EPS excluding the discrete items \u2013 was $1.60.  Last quarter, we also increased our full-year estimate for our incremental investment in e-commerce to $0.10. However, during the fourth quarter, this investment was approximately $0.04 per share, bringing the total fiscal 2014 incremental investment in e-commerce to $0.11 per share. Consolidated net sales increased 1.4%, or $1.8 billion, for a fourth quarter total of $128.8 billion. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 2.8% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter to $130.6 billion.  With respect to comp sales, total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.4% for the 14-week period ended January 31. Bill and Roz will provide more details for Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club.  Consolidated membership and other income increased 12.7% to $920 million. The increase was primarily driven by the sale of certain real estate assets within our U.S. segments, which was recognized in other income, and a solid 9.0% increase in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club.  Strategic price investment within all three operating segments contributed to a 40 basis point reduction in our gross profit rate, bringing it to 23.9% for the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.9%, an increase of 73 basis points, driven primarily by Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart International.  Discrete items impacted operating expenses by 71 basis points. Excluding the impact of discrete items, operating expenses as a percentage of sales, would have increased 2 basis points to approximately 18.2% compared to last year.  Corporate & support expenses, which include core corporate, Global eCommerce support, and Global leverage services, increased 8.3% for the quarter. Core corporate expenses increased 5.8%. FCPA and compliance-related expenses were approximately $58 million, which was below our guidance of $75 to $80 million for the quarter.  Approximately $38 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while the remaining $20 million was related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Excluding these FCPA and compliance matters, core corporate expenses would have increased 6.3%, primarily driven by technology investments for people systems and training.  Fourth quarter operating income decreased 14.4% to $7.3 billion. Discrete items impacted operating income by 10.6%. Excluding the impact of discrete items, operating income would have decreased 3.8% to $8.3 billion.  Net interest expense increased 16.1% to $554 million. The increase was primarily driven by interest accruals related to non-income tax discrete items in Brazil and higher debt balances, offset by a reclassification of certain international accounts payable discounts to cost of sales.  This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart of $4.4 billion, a decrease of 21.0% compared to last year. Discrete items impacted income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart by 15.5%. Excluding the impact of the discrete items, income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart decreased 5.5% to $5.3 billion.  Capital expenditures were approximately $3.6 billion for the quarter. We added approximately 9.9 million retail square feet through 206 net new, expanded and relocated units. Moving on to returns, during the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 11.2 million shares for approximately $877 million and also paid $1.5 billion in dividends. That wraps up our report of Q4. Now, let\u2019s review highlights for the entire fiscal year. For fiscal year 2014, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share of $4.85, versus last year's EPS of $5.01, a decrease of 3.2%. Our underlying EPS increased 2.0% to $5.11. Our effective tax rate was 32.9%, compared to 31.0% for the prior year. This was within our full year guidance of 31 to 33%. Consolidated net sales were $473.1 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion, or 1.6%, over last year. Acquisitions added approximately $730 million to net sales, while fluctuations in currency negatively impacted net sales by $5.1 billion. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.5% to $477.5 billion. For the 53-week period ended January 31, U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.4%. While our gross profit grew 1.5%, our gross profit rate declined 3 basis points to 24.3%, which reflects our ongoing investment in price, as well as our global merchandise mix. For the year, operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 27 basis points to 19.3%.  Discrete items impacted operating expenses by 19 basis points. Excluding the impact of the discrete items, operating expenses as a percentage of total sales would have increased 8 basis points to 19.1%.  Corporate & support expenses increased 24.1% for the full year, primarily from our investments in leverage services and Global eCommerce. Core corporate expenses, which included $282 million in charges related to FCPA matters, increased 15.6%.  Approximately $173 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while the remaining $109 million was related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Excluding these FCPA and compliance matters, core corporate expenses would have increased 6.7%.  Now, turning to our full year operating income\u2026 Operating income decreased 3.1% to $26.9 billion. Discrete items impacted operating income by 3.3%. Excluding the discrete items, operating income would have increased 0.2% to $27.8 billion.  Income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart for the full year decreased 5.7% to $16.0 billion, compared to $17.0 billion last year. Discrete items impacted income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart by 5.0%. Excluding the discrete items, income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart would have decreased 0.7% to $16.9 billion.  Consolidated inventory grew 2.4%, driven primarily by both U.S. operating segments. You\u2019ll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding the individual drivers of inventory growth.  We ended the year with capital expenditures of $13.1 billion, slightly above our range of $12.0 to $13.0 billion, primarily the result of additional small format activity in Walmart U.S. For the year, the company added approximately 32.6 million retail square feet through 529 net new, expanded and relocated units. You will hear more from Bill and Charles on our revised fiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan. With respect to leverage, our debt to total capitalization was 42.6%, compared to 41.5% last year. Free cash flow for the 12 months ended January 31 was $10.1 billion, a decrease of $2.6 billion. The timing of tax payments, as well as slightly higher capital expenditures, were the primary drivers of the reduction.  Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2014 was 17.0%, compared to 18.1% last year. The reduction in ROI is primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income, investments in fixed assets, and the impact of acquisitions. Discrete items impacted return on investment by 40 basis points. Excluding the impact of discrete items, ROI would have been 17.4%.  The company repurchased approximately 89.1 million shares for $6.7 billion and paid $6.1 billion in dividends. As of January 31, 2014, we have approximately $11.3 billion remaining under our current $15 billion share repurchase authorization. Now, let\u2019s turn it over to our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S. Bill? William Simon : Thank you, Claire. In the fourth quarter, the U.S. retail business environment was challenging. It was marked by a shortened holiday season, severe winter storms, and reduced government benefits. While these factors impacted our business, they also brought out the best in our associates and have further cemented our customers\u2019 reliance on our commitment to price leadership.  Net sales grew by $1.8 billion or 2.4%. For the 14 weeks ending January 31, comp store sales were down 0.4%, with ticket up 1.3% and traffic down 1.7%. In the absence of a reduction of government SNAP benefits, which represented approximately 40 basis points of impact to comp sales, we believe the quarter would have been flat. Additionally, comps were pressured by winter storms, which forced the closure of over 200 stores at some point over the course of quarter. While we\u2019re disappointed with comp sales, there are a number of things that made me particularly proud. We kicked off the season with a successful Black Friday event, led by strong customer response to the one-hour-guarantee program. We followed that with an excellent Cyber Monday, which marked the biggest sales day in walmart.com\u2019s history.  I\u2019m pleased with our event execution and coordination between our online business and our physical stores. Our commitment to price leadership, aggressive marketing and strong execution helped us deliver a positive sales comp during the 6-week holiday season ending December 27, 2013. Due in large part to our holiday performance, we gained share across all of our tracked general merchandise categories, including entertainment, toys, automotive, stationery, home and apparel, for the 13 weeks ending January 4, 2014, according to The NPD Group.  In addition, we continue to be pleased with the strength of our small formats. These stores continue to deliver positive comp sales and traffic increases each quarter. In fact, comp sales, without fuel, for Neighborhood Markets grew approximately 5% for the 14-week period.  Now, let me share more detail about the financial results for the fourth quarter. We had modest year-over-year operating income growth to $6.4 billion. Gross profit increased 0.8%, with our gross profit rate down 41 basis points, driven primarily by a commitment to price leadership.  Our customers rely on us to deliver low prices on the items they want most. We believe our price investment was a material driver to accelerated share gains and positive comps during the holiday season.  We delivered 17 basis points of expense leverage. For the quarter, expenses increased only 1.4% in spite of headwind related to group health care costs. The operations team executed holiday plans extremely well and efficiently transitioned stores between a normal day-to-day business and holiday events to serve a record number of customers during the Thanksgiving week.  In fact, during the peak 4-hour period, our associates processed more than 10 million transactions. That\u2019s over 40,000 transactions per minute. We also benefitted from a $33 million gain related to the sale of real estate that was recorded in other income. Q4 inventory grew 3.8%, moderating from prior quarters, but still higher than the rate of sales. We remain committed to disciplined inventory management and are well positioned for spring seasonal conversion. Now, let me cover some of the highlights from our merchandising areas.  Grocery, which includes food and consumables, gained 24 basis points of market share for the 13 weeks ending February 1, 2014 according to The Nielsen Company. Our overall grocery comp was in the low single-digit negative range, due in part to SNAP benefit reductions. Excluding those impacts, we\u2019re encouraged by the underlying business. We saw strong mid-single-digit positive comps in produce and adult beverages, which benefitted from enhanced quality and price investments. Additionally, we had positive comps in other fresh departments, including meat, deli and bakery.  Health & wellness continued its momentum, delivering a low single-digit positive comp. Our prescription business was particularly strong, with a mid-single-digit positive comp due in part to inflation. This helped offset pressure from a soft flu season, which also adversely impacted our over-the- counter business.  Hardlines, including seasonal, had a low single-digit positive comp for the quarter. Our Christmas seasonal business performed well, with strength across the entire business, including lights, trees, and d\u00e9cor. Hardware and paint, as well as automotive, also delivered solid comps, with strong sales in cold weather categories, such as car care and heaters.  Entertainment, including toys, posted a mid-single-digit negative comp. However, we were able to grow market share. Our one-hour guarantee program, the \u201cChosen by Kids\u201d program and a strong Black Friday event performance led to share gains for the 13 weeks ending January 4, 2014, according to The NPD Group. While we were pleased with our share performance, we continued to face challenges related to ongoing entertainment industry contraction.  Our home business reported a low single-digit positive comp. Broad assortment helped both bath & bedding, as well as cooking & dining, deliver strong mid-single-digit positive comps. National brands such as Calphalon, Farberware, Keurig, and SodaStream also drove traffic and sales growth in home.  Our apparel business delivered a low single-digit positive comp, with strength across several categories. Sales of national brands, such as Avia and Russell, led the way during the quarter. Cold weather apparel and active wear posted particularly strong comps.  I\u2019m happy to report that our e-commerce business continued to perform well. For the fourth quarter, it contributed approximately 30 basis points to the total Walmart U.S. comp. As I mentioned, we had our strongest Cyber Monday ever. Customers are rapidly adopting mobile, and we\u2019re evolving quickly by enhancing the experience through improved apps. Continued enhancements of our e-commerce platform and fulfillment network are top priorities, and we invested strategically to strengthen these areas. Our Texas dotcom fulfillment center processed more orders than planned, and our new Pennsylvania center opens within the next few weeks. The strategic location of these fulfillment centers complement others already in place and allow us to reduce the time to deliver merchandise.  Now, let me now cover the financial results for the full year. During the fiscal year, net sales increased $5.0 billion, or 1.8%, to $279.4 billion. Comp sales declined 0.6% for the 53-week period ending January 31, while operating income grew 4.0% \u2013 or more than twice the rate of sales \u2013 to $22.4 billion. Gross profit for the year increased 1.8%, with a slight gross profit rate decline. Price investments were offset by cost of goods savings initiatives.  Expenses were up 0.9%. We successfully leveraged each quarter of the year. Within our supply chain, logistics utilized optimized routes and distribution center mechanization to drive efficiencies. Store operations leveraged technology investments, such as self-checkouts and MyGuide, to improve associate productivity.  We\u2019re proud of our ongoing commitment to expense leverage. Since fiscal 2010, we\u2019ve delivered 83 basis points of cumulative leverage. Those savings allow us to invest in price and fuel the productivity loop.  Despite improvements in overall operational efficiency, group health care expenses were a headwind for the year and will continue to be in fiscal 2015. As our health care plans already exceed the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, we didn\u2019t expect the implementation of ACA to materially impact our benefits costs. However, we\u2019ve experienced higher-than- anticipated enrollment. This has placed pressure on our benefits expense. We\u2019ve accounted for this in our financial guidance and will monitor it closely throughout the year.  With regards to real estate, our strategy is centered on providing customers access to the broadest array of products through a digitally connected, multi-format portfolio. To this end, we accelerated the growth of our small format stores. We added 105 new Neighborhood Markets this year, bringing our current fleet to 346 total units.  These stores delivered an approximately 4% sales comp for the year, driven by fresh and pharmacy. In fact, our Neighborhood Market fleet is performing comparable or favorable to leading grocers around the country. We also opened 7 Walmart Express units this year, bringing the total to 20. We continue to learn from these stores and are excited by the options this format offers.  Supercenters will also continue to play a role in our overall growth and are essential to the grocery stock-up and broader shopping trips. Including expansions, conversions and relocations, we opened 130 units this year.  Let me share with you some positive developments in our growth plans. Recall in October that we announced plans to build 120 to 150 new small stores for fiscal 2015. We\u2019ve been working to improve our speed to market and lower capital costs to allow us to move more aggressively.  I\u2019m very pleased to announce that we\u2019re further accelerating our small store growth and now anticipate opening between 270 and 300 this fiscal year. Our customers\u2019 needs and expectations are changing. I believe these stores will enable us to exceed their expectations by providing convenience and easy access to fresh foods, pharmacy and fuel. Through the intersection with walmart.com, we can connect our physical asset base to the broad assortment that is available online. These increases will nearly double our small store fleet, driving retail growth as we enter the next generation of retail. Including expansions, conversions and relocations, we will deliver 385 to 415 new units versus our prior guidance of 235 to 265 new units. Total incremental square footage is anticipated to be between 21 and 23 million square feet, versus our previous guidance of 19 to 21 million square feet.  Given the small format acceleration, we are also updating our capital expenditure guidance, from a range of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion to a new range of $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion.  We currently have over 4,200 stores and will grow that significantly this fiscal year. Our full fleet will serve as the physical access points for our digital business, combining these two worlds in a unique way. Site to Store, Ship from Store, Pay with Cash, and Scan & Go are great examples of what we\u2019re currently doing to marry digital and physical experiences.  In October, we expanded the grocery delivery test to the Denver market, and we\u2019re getting a great response. Almost 90% of the customers rate the service above average or outstanding. And just last month, we announced an easy pick-up option for online grocery and general merchandise orders in Denver. We\u2019re leveraging our global learning from the Asda Click and Collect program, a highly successful model. And, we\u2019ll continue to innovate in this space and invest in meaningful opportunities.  Reflecting on the year, I\u2019m really proud of the impact we\u2019re having on our customers and communities. We launched our veterans hiring program in May and have since hired more than 30,000 honorably discharged veterans. We\u2019ve also made great strides in our domestic manufacturing initiative. Our activity to date will lead to the creation of an estimated 58,000 new U.S. manufacturing-related jobs. We have strong commitments from suppliers and recently announced a $10-million, 5-year Walmart U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund to spur innovations that support America\u2019s growing manufacturing footprint.  For fiscal 2015, we\u2019re focusing on growth and returning to positive comps. We\u2019ll leverage what\u2019s already working well in areas, such as home, apparel, and produce, and continue to drive improvement in opportunity areas such as dry goods, snacks & beverages, consumables, and entertainment.  We\u2019ll also address underperforming stores. We recognize the need to win at the convergence of digital and physical, and we\u2019ll leverage our more than 4,200 stores as access points for our digital business to further spur growth through e-commerce. And, of course, we\u2019ll do this in the Walmart way \u2013 leveraging expenses and remaining true to our everyday low price promise.  In the first quarter, we expect the retail landscape to remain challenging. Comp sales were down at the beginning of the 13-week period, due largely to continued winter storms. However, we\u2019re encouraged by our underlying business trends and anticipate a positive sales comp for the balance of the quarter. Therefore, we expect a relatively flat sales comp for the 13-week period ending May 2. Last year\u2019s 13-week comp ending April 26, 2013 was down 1.4%.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David for an update on Walmart International. Dave? David Cheesewright : Thank you, Bill. Let me start by saying how honored I am to lead Walmart\u2019s growing international business. I\u2019m proud to be part of such a strong leadership team that is committed to advancing our global mission of saving people money so they can live better around the world.  As we\u2019ve said for some time now, we\u2019re operating in a challenging global environment, with low inflation, relatively high unemployment and fragile consumer confidence leading to modest consumer spending. Having said that, we\u2019re aggressively focused on leading the business with a long-term view on our customer, and we\u2019re confident that our teams are aligned on the right strategies to succeed and deliver our core mission. Our strategy is a simple promise of being in good businesses and running them well. This lays the groundwork for delivering our financial priorities \u2013 growth, leverage and returns. We\u2019ve initiated actions in Mexico, Brazil, China and India to improve our operating model in those key countries, and this will continue to be a priority this year.  Looking forward, we\u2019re focused on several key areas : \u2022 First is to deliver on our role of being a strong growth vehicle for the company. This can come in many forms, but we will continue to focus aggressively on driving comp sales in each of our markets. This is the most efficient manner for us to drive top-line as well as returns.  We will be the lowest cost operator in each market. We\u2019re in good shape in many markets, but we have room to improve everywhere. Driving the productivity loop is core to our operating model and how we serve our customers. We will be passionate about price leadership wherever we operate. We will build a platform for profitable growth in China. We\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made here and will continue to make this a priority. We\u2019re focused on stabilizing Brazil. This has been a challenging market for a number of reasons, and we\u2019re working on many fronts to improve our competitive position here. I\u2019m very excited about our continuing growth in e-commerce globally. It\u2019s a big part of our plans going forward, and we\u2019re working closely with Neil\u2019s team around the world to ensure we\u2019re leading at the intersection of physical and digital. Just in the last year, we\u2019ve grown Yihaodian and Brazil ecommerce sales at nearly twice the market rate.  We\u2019re also seeing great progress in the U.K., Canada and Mexico. Let me remind you of our announcement on February 6 of the completion of our purchase of approximately 25% of the shares of Walmart Chile from certain minority shareholders. As a result of this transaction, Walmart now owns approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of Walmart Chile, and we recently launched a cash tender offer for the remaining shares. We believe in the potential of this market, and this purchase continues Walmart\u2019s growth strategy.  Let\u2019s now turn to our results for the fourth quarter. Claire has provided detail on the discrete items that I\u2019ll be referring to. On a reported basis, International net sales were $37.7 billion, down 0.4%, with currency exchange fluctuations unfavorably impacting sales by approximately $1.8 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4.3%. Around the globe, the holiday season was softer than we would\u2019ve liked, particularly in our larger markets, as we continue to see customers manage on a relatively tight budget. Gross profit rate, on a reported basis, fell 53 basis points and on a constant currency basis, decreased 44 basis points.  This was primarily driven by price investments in Brazil, Canada and Mexico. 21 Relatively soft sales, along with the previously disclosed discrete items, impacted our ability to leverage expenses during the quarter. Operating expenses increased 12.5% on a reported basis, and increased 18.8% on a constant currency basis. The discrete items impacted operating expenses by 13.2 percentage points. Excluding these items, operating expenses would\u2019ve grown 5.6%.  We are disappointed in our leverage performance for the quarter. As always, our teams are focused on operational efficiency and are making progress on several cost reduction initiatives. For example, in the U.K., plans are in place to roll hybrid checkout registers across 130 stores in early FY 15 and to expand on global scan and go initiatives. Mexico is improving associate productivity by optimizing modular, financial and promotional planning to drive improved layout accuracy and in-stock.  On a reported basis, operating income decreased 45.8%, compared to last year and decreased 44.3% on a constant currency basis. The discrete items impacted operating income by 37.8percentage points. Excluding these items, operating income would\u2019ve declined 6.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating expenses and price investment. Inventory grew faster than sales, but we\u2019ve made significant progress across our markets. Let\u2019s turn to the results for the year. For fiscal 2014, reported net sales were $136.5 billion, growing 1.3% over last year. Currency exchange fluctuations negatively impacted sales by approximately $5.1 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 4.6%.  This is the first quarter our Yihaodian acquisition is included in our constant currency numbers. During the first three quarters of the year, Yihaodian contributed $730 million in sales, which were not included in our constant currency results. We are especially pleased that in this tough environment, we grew market share in most countries and maintained share in a challenging Mexico market. We did experience share loss in the U.K. and Brazil. Competitors remained very aggressive with vouchering in the U.K., and around the world, we continue to focus on expanding price leadership. Operating expenses on a reported basis were $27.4 billion, up 5.5%. On a constant currency basis, expenses increased 9.7%. Discrete items impacted operating expenses by 3.6percentage points. Without these items, operating expenses would have grown 6.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by headwinds in Brazil and Mexico and investments in e-commerce.  The combination of soft sales, price investments, higher expenses, and investments in e-commerce, caused operating income for the year to decrease 17.6% on a reported basis and 14.8% on a constant currency basis. The discrete items impacted operating income by 13.8percentage points. Without these items, operating income would have declined 1.0% on a constant currency basis.  Now let\u2019s turn to the individual market results. As a reminder, the following discussion is on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, net sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal, calendar basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. For Brazil and China, we discuss stores and e-commerce separately.  For the fourth quarter, net sales in the U.K. increased 1.3%, while comparable sales declined 0.2%. We are pleased that traffic increased 0.2%, offset by a ticket decline of 0.4%. Gross profit rate was flat for the quarter, as sourcing benefits and efficiencies were invested into maintaining a strong price position. The U.K. macroeconomic environment improved slightly in the fourth quarter with GDP growth of 0.7% and unemployment falling to a four-year low of 7.1%. However, the macro picture is masking a slower recovery from a consumer perspective, with staple item price inflation continuing to outstrip personal earnings growth.  In this tough economic environment and with inflation slowing, total market growth for the 12 weeks ending January 5 was relatively modest at 2.9%. With online growth and a growing discount sector, all major retailers, including Asda, had overall share declines. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose by 18 basis points. Headwinds in indirect taxation, employment costs and investments in e-commerce were offset somewhat by cost discipline across operations. We improved check-out efficiencies, procurement savings on supplies, supply chain efficiencies and energy savings, and we expect to deliver more benefits this year. Due to the expense headwinds, operating income decreased 1.5%.  Inventory was reduced 2.7%, driven by improved stock to sales control, as well as the conversion to the Global Replenishment System earlier in the year. We recently announced a new strategy at Asda that we expect will redefine value retailing in the U.K. This will involve improving our core business by investing UK1.25 billion in price and quality over the next 5 years. We will bring this value to more customers by improving access and reach across the U.K., focusing on online growth and expanding stores into the faster growing South East and London markets.  We became the first mainstream U.K. retailer to introduce a Black Friday event. Special prices across electronics and toys, procured with our global sourcing team, helped drive strong traffic growth, with 450,000 additional transactions on the first day of the event. We started off the New Year with a 50-pence store event designed to provide customers value when they need it most.  Our multichannel offering in the U.K. continues to strengthen, and online sales increased 18.6%. We added 87 Click & Collect sites in the U.K., including 6 Underground station locations as part of an innovative collaboration with Transport for London. We also added 160,000 square feet of net selling space within the quarter, adding stores in carefully selected areas, bringing access to new customers.  We continue to focus on supporting local communities in the U.K. Over the year, we raised over UK7 million for a number of national charities and community organizations, exceeding our goal by 36%.  In Canada, fourth quarter net sales grew 0.4%, while comp sales decreased 1.7%. Comp traffic decreased 2.7% with ticket increasing 1.0%. The decrease in comp store sales was due to several factors, including exceptionally severe winter weather during December, declining consumer spending and price competition.  Although we saw solid low single-digit comps across the board in food and consumables, this was offset by our Walmart discount stores, which struggled particularly in electronics and hardlines.  Despite the soft comp sales, we achieved an overall increase of 45 basis points of market share according to The Nielsen Company\u2019s measured channels for the most recently reported 12-week period ending January 25. We remain excited about our e-commerce business. In fact, we had our best online sales day ever during our Black Friday event. For the quarter, online sales grew 145%.  Our gross margin rate decreased 88 basis points due to continued aggressive price investment. Operating expenses grew 0.9%. Higher costs for utilities, maintenance and repair, and investments in e-commerce were offset somewhat by store wage leverage. As a result of this, operating income decreased by 5.3%. Despite the sales softness, inventory was well managed, with total inventory flat to last year.  During the fourth quarter, we completed 9 new supercentres, 5 expansions and 7 in-box conversions in Canada. For the year, we added 10 net new stores, bringing our total count to 389 retail locations. In addition, we recently announced a C$500 million capital investment to continue our growth for stores and e-commerce.  Now, let\u2019s move to Africa. As you know, Massmart is a publicly held subsidiary that operates in 12 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its fiscal year ends in December and the company will release its year-end results on February 27. We are pleased with the progress our management team is making in this market.  Now let\u2019s move on to our larger Latin American markets. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported fourth quarter results on February 18, under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex-reported numbers. Our Mexico results exclude the impact of the pending Vips sale, whose operations results are recorded in discontinued operations.  For the quarter, Walmex consolidated net sales grew 3.5%. Gross profit rate decreased 44 basis points, driven by a decrease of 77 basis points in Mexico. Central America had a 183 basis point increase in gross profit rate that was driven by better markdown management and merchandising mix. Walmex operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 72 basis points. Operating income decreased 8.1%.  In Mexico, net sales increased 3.1% over last year, but comparable stores sales decreased 1.6%. Sales were negatively impacted by the country\u2019s continued economic slowdown and especially soft performance by Sam\u2019s Club. Mexico\u2019s self-service formats \u2013 Bodega Aurrera, Superama and Walmart Supercenters \u2013 plus Sam\u2019s, lagged the market by 60 basis points. Excluding Sam\u2019s, our self-service formats, outpaced the market by 70 basis points.  Gross margin declined 77 basis points as a result of price investment and an aggressive competitive environment. Operating expenses increased 9.0%, and operating income declined 10.3%. Operating expenses were negatively impacted 3.3percentage points by a non-cash charge to rent expense to properly state certain store lease liabilities. Excluding this item, operating expenses would\u2019ve increased 5.7%. Operating income was impacted by 3.8 percentage points, resulting in a comparable operating income decrease of 6.5%. Inventory grew faster than sales, but inventory quality remains good, and we expect to right-size our position in the first quarter.  During the quarter, we opened 100 net new stores and 211 during the year to bring our total store count to 2,199.  For fiscal 2015, we expect continued economic pressures, including a new tax on high-calorie food and beverages, and an increase of VAT in border cities. We expect moderate improvement in the economy, driven by government investment and increased remittances from the U.S.  In addition, our co-branded credit card agreement with BBVA Bancomer ended, which is having some impact on extending and usage of credit for our customers. We are exploring strategic alternatives to strengthen the financial service offerings to our customer.  Mexico is reinforcing its fundamentals and is reaffirming its price leadership position in the market. In our Sam\u2019s Clubs, we\u2019re improving the value proposition for our members by offering better assortment and lower price points. We continue to invest in and are pleased with our e-commerce sales growth. According to Comscore, we are the third most visited site in Mexico, and according to Euromonitor International, we are number one in online grocery sales due to our Superama delivery program.  We are encouraged by the performance of Central America, where net sales increased 6.1%, with comparable store sales increasing 1.8%. Gross profit rate increased 183 basis points, due to improved markdown management compared with the prior year.  Operating expenses increased 9.5% and operating income increased 39.4%. Operating expenses were impacted 3.7percentage points by the similar rent expense charge as mentioned earlier with Mexico. In addition, operating income was also impacted by 19.6percentage points by the rent charge. Excluding this charge, operating expense grew 5.8% and operating income increased 59.0%.  During the quarter, we opened 4 net new stores and 19 during the year, bringing our total store count in Central America to 661.  Moving on to Brazil, fourth quarter net sales grew 5.3%, with total comp sales up 4.6%. We\u2019ve seen improved performance in our retail formats, driven by our food and consumables categories, but wholesale formats remain soft. Average ticket grew 8.0%, and traffic declined 3.4%. Gross profit rate decreased 328 basis points, as we continue to invest to drive price leadership. We\u2019re driving the productivity loop, with investments in systems integration in both retail and wholesale formats.  Operating expenses were up 75.2%, resulting in an operating loss for the quarter. The discrete items mentioned earlier impacted operating expenses by 68.5percentage points. Excluding the discrete items, operating expenses increased 6.7% and resulted in a smaller operating loss.  Confronted with wage inflation, the Brazil team has responded with productivity initiatives to help offset these headwinds. As a result, labor productivity for the year increased approximately 7%.  With a new site launched in October, Brazil\u2019s e-commerce continued its strong track record of sales growth and market share gains. We had a strong performance in unique visitors during the period. The top-performing online categories included phones, phone accessories and electronics. For the year, online sales grew at about twice the rate of the market.  Our position in Brazil remains challenging, but we are implementing a number of initiatives to stabilize the business and to put us on a stronger foundation going forward. Now let\u2019s move on to Asia. Walmart China sales grew 3.7% during the fourth quarter, with comp sales up 0.4%. Comp was driven by an 8.6% increase in ticket, while traffic declined 8.2%, as customer behavior continued to shift towards fewer trips and larger baskets.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales during the quarter improved 42 basis points as \u201cBuy 4 Less\u201d initiatives delivered cost savings even with investments in price. China had an operating loss for the quarter, driven by expense growth of 34.2%. However, expenses were impacted 38.8percentage points by the discrete items. After adjusting for the discrete items, expenses decreased 4.6%, and operating income increased by 416.4%, measured against a relatively low base.  On a full year basis, China\u2019s sales grew 4.3%, with comp sales growth of 0.7%. Operating income decreased 139%. The discrete items impacted operating income 177.5percentage points. Excluding the discrete items, operating income would have increased 38.5%. We\u2019ve made progress on our \u201cWorry Free\u201d price campaign in China. Continued price investments, supported by our \u201cBuy 4 Less\u201d initiatives, have saved customers money, while increasing full year gross margin by 11 basis points versus last year.  The China strategy embodies our \u201cEvery Day Low Cost\u201d philosophy, and we continue to lower expenses and increase wage productivity. Operating expenses were up 11.3% for the year. The discrete items impacted operating expenses by 9.9percentage points. Without the discrete items, operating expenses would have increased 1.4% for the year.  The overall market in China remains challenged, due to headwinds from the ongoing government austerity campaign on gift giving, as well as price deflation in key categories such as liquor, edible oil and rice.  Yihaodian sales grew at triple digit rates, significantly outgrowing the market. In Q4, we improved our customer experience by recombining the marketplace with the Yihaodian site. We continue to be the top seller of key merchandise, such as imported foods, including milk, which is helping to drive loyalty and repeat visits. Turning to Japan, I\u2019m happy to share that we delivered positive comp sales for the second straight quarter. Comp sales grew 0.7%, with an overall sales growth of 1.6%. While comp ticket grew at 3.0%, store traffic declined 2.3%.  Net sales for the year grew 0.3%; however, comp sales were negative 0.5%. Despite investments in price, Walmart Japan increased gross margin 15 basis points, driven by increases in private brand penetration, direct imports, as well as managing fresh throws. In addition, Japan has been able to increase the price gap with the competition.  I also want to acknowledge the effort put in by the Japan team on controlling costs, leveraging full year operating expenses by 34 basis points as a percentage of sales, despite continued increases in energy costs. The benefit from insurance proceeds related to the 2010 earthquake helped offset operating expenses. Benefiting from a relatively small base, Japan ended the year with an operating income increase of 25.2%.  Looking forward in Japan, we are monitoring the potential impact of the new consumption tax that will take effect on April 1. We expect that the pending tax will pull forward buying activity for bigger ticket items into the first quarter. We are pleased with our continued improvement in Japan.  In India, we completed the separation with our joint venture partner, Bharti Enterprises, on December 31, 2013, and now own 100% of the Best Price Modern Wholesale Cash & Carry operations. Cash and carry stores delivered a healthy comp of 19.7% this year, and we remain committed to the Indian market with this strong format.  Looking ahead for the International segment as a whole, we expect global macroeconomic conditions to remain challenging, but are seeing some green shoots of economic recovery in various markets. For example, the economic outlook in the U.K. is improving, the outlook for China appears to be stable, and inflation should help a few markets.  As a global company, we have responsibilities to the countries in which we operate. We earn trust through our commitment to compliance, social and environmental issues. Over the past year, we\u2019ve invested in compliance processes, training and building talented teams and will continue to do so. These processes are very important for us going forward.  In addition, I\u2019m delighted to be part of a company that\u2019s donated millions to support charities and is leading on environmental sustainability. I\u2019m very proud of the work Walmart does to support our communities around the world.  In closing, let me stress again how excited I am to be in this role and how optimistic I am about what the future holds for Walmart International. We are sharply focused on the priorities I discussed earlier. We have the talent in place and the right strategies to meet these objectives, and I look forward to updating you in the months and years to come about our progress.  Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the Sam\u2019s Club results. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : : Let\u2019s begin with the Q4 results. Similar to other retailers, the unforeseen winter weather was a significant headwind to the quarter. There were a number of bright spots, however, such as positive savings member traffic and their strong response to our new merchandise. Let me walk you through the highs and lows of Q4.  Going into the quarter, we were solidly positioned to have a successful holiday season. Sales and club traffic accelerated at the beginning of Thanksgiving week, led primarily by our exclusive Sunday evening VIP Event, which posted a very strong high single-digit comp.  However, traffic slowed following Thanksgiving, as severe winter weather covered geographic areas where we are highly penetrated, particularly the Midwest and the Plains regions. This caused a rather pronounced sales lull prior to Christmas, disrupting critical holiday shopping weekends and cancelling many holiday functions. This impact was further compounded by a shortened selling season, which limited our opportunity to recover sales, particularly in our food and beverage categories. While this boosted our online performance, we were disappointed to see that sales did not materialize as expected.  Our comp for the 14-week period ending Jan. 31, 2014, excluding fuel, declined 0.1%, comprised of a traffic increase of 1.2% and a ticket decline of 1.3%.  On a positive note, our new merchandise is resonating well with our savings member segment, or those shopping for their personal needs. However, the continued shortfalls in our business member segment, driven primarily by convenience store consolidation and a declining tobacco business, pressured our results. Business member traffic and ticket were both negative this quarter. If you\u2019re familiar with our business, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that our business member base has been declining. Many of the small businesses we serve make a big difference to the economic environment that we all share. According to Gallup, micro-businesses \u2013 those with five or fewer employees \u2013 make up about 80% of all companies in the U.S. Clearly, the efforts of these businesses matter to the health of the economy, and they especially matter to us at Sam\u2019s Club.  To serve our business members, we\u2019ll be rolling out new member services this coming year, initially geared at supporting the needs of our micro-business members and strengthening renewal rates. You\u2019ll hear more about these services in the coming year.  Now, on to the financials \u2026 As Claire previously mentioned, there are two discrete items affecting comparability of our reported financials that represent an unfavorable net impact. During the quarter, we recorded operating expense charges of approximately $59 million related to the implementation of a new in-club staffing structure and the closure of one club. Net sales, including fuel, were $14.7 billion, up 1.3% over last year. Fuel prices decreased 2.6% compared to last year, and gallons sold were up 4.5%, contributing 10 basis points to overall sales. Sam\u2019s gross profit rate decreased 18 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 82 basis points. Operating income decreased 15.3% to $425 million. Inventory, including fuel, was up 3.2%, largely a result of new club openings. , : Net sales for the quarter were $13.2 billion, up 1.2% from last year. Retail inflation across the club was essentially flat. Cost inflation remained slightly inflationary.  Now let\u2019s discuss the merchandising results. Over the past year, we have worked to sharpen our merchandising focus around price, bulk, quality and excitement, with very positive results. Our home and apparel categories have done exceptionally well, as our merchants brought in new, exciting merchandise that really resonated with our members. In the coming months, we will roll out even more new merchandise to additional areas across the club.  There were three factors that affected our Q4 merchandising results \u2013 the winter weather I mentioned, the reduction in SNAP benefits and disinflation. Despite these headwinds, the majority of our merchandising categories reported positive comp sales. We continue to place an emphasis on fresh, driving a low single-digit positive comp within fresh, freezer and cooler. A focus on newness and quality helped boost our Thanksgiving meal performance, with fresh sides and fresh meat both delivering low single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Deflationary pressures, specifically in dairy and cooler categories, tempered our growth.  Grocery and beverage reported an essentially flat comp. The combination of price investments and new SKUs drove unit growth in our snacks category. This growth was offset by sales declines in weather-sensitive categories, such as juice and water.  Tobacco performance was in line with prior quarters, with a low single-digit negative comp. Our Instant Savings events are driving awareness of our merchandise offering, resulting in market share gains in categories like table top, trash bags, and food storage, as measured by The Nielsen Group for the 13-week period ending January 18, 2014. This growth was offset by declines in our pet business, resulting in a flat comp for consumables.  We are optimistic about the growth opportunities in health and wellness. For the quarter, health and wellness delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Member response to our pharmacist-administered immunizations drove traffic and pharmacy script counts grew. Over-the-counter sales decelerated from the prior quarter, as we lap strong prior year performance in key diet and nutrition items.  Home, apparel and hardlines delivered a mid-single-digit comp. The merchants have really transformed this area, bringing in new items and driving excitement. In December alone, we transitioned the clubs three times, focusing on apparel at the beginning of the month, giftable items prior to Christmas, and then a home gallery vignette set on December 26, that performed exceptionally well.  Within technology and entertainment, our VIP event and cyber week delivered solid growth. Samsclub.com is becoming even more important, with member usage increasing. During non-peak times, however, sales were soft, especially in highly competitive categories like TVs, portable electronics, and wireless.  This ultimately led to a mid-single-digit negative comp. Technology and entertainment has been challenged over the past year, experiencing deflationary pressures and ever-changing member preferences. The team is actively working to reenergize our assortment, predominantly in mobile, driving sales with new and exciting technology.  As our eCommerce business continues to strengthen, Black Friday and Cyber Week offers led to another quarter of double-digit sales growth. E-commerce sales contributed approximately 40 basis points for the 14- week comp period ending January 31, 2014. Year-long site improvements have strengthened conversion, particularly in mobile transactions. To continue supporting this growth, we\u2019ve named Jamie Iannone CEO of samsclub.com, fully integrating the Sam\u2019s Club eCommerce team with the Walmart Global eCommerce team. The integration allows us to build on our collective strengths and improve the member experience.  Now let\u2019s continue with the reported financials \u2026 Gross profit rate decreased 21 basis points. The gross profit rate was unfavorably impacted by an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities of $39 million, or 30 basis points. Excluding this adjustment, our gross profit rate increased 9 basis points due to the merchandise mix. Our merchants continue to invest in price leadership and have managed our gross profit rate well in a very competitive pricing environment.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 91 basis points, due to changes in our staffing structure and sales challenges. The charge related to our new staffing structure and the closure of one club negatively impacted operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 45 basis points. Excluding this, operating expenses as a percentage of sales would have increased by 46 basis points. Expense reduction, improved productivity, and innovation are even greater priorities for us in this fiscal year. Now, I\u2019d like to call out membership income, which grew 9.0%, making Q4 our strongest quarter of the year. Back in May, we took our first fee increase since 2006 and coincidently launched Instant Savings for all. Response to Instant Savings has been incredibly well received, providing a disciplined opportunity to demonstrate price leadership. Our members have welcomed Instant Savings, both in-club and online, and it will continue to be one of several ways we communicate value.  Investments such as Instant Savings and our new merchandise have strengthened our membership offering, growing our new sign-ups and improving our Plus level membership renewals and upgrades. While part of our growth is attributable to new clubs, we\u2019ve also utilized innovative ways to reach new prospects, such as leveraging social media campaigns. In November, we launched a social media initiative to drive new membership growth through compelling online offerings. This drove over 160,000 redemptions and helped grow our member base.  In other income, sales charged to the Sam\u2019s Club credit card reached record highs, resulting in a financial benefit from a profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider. Additionally, we realized gains of $24 million for the sale of two real estate properties, increasing other income as a percentage of sales by 18 basis points. These factors contributed to our membership and other income growth of 23.4%.  Our fourth quarter operating income was $412 million, a 15.7% decline from last year. Excluding the charges for the new club structure, the closure of one club, product warranties and the real estate gains, which net to $74 million, operating income declined 0.6%. Let\u2019s turn to the results for the year. Our annual performance was solid, especially for the first half of the year. With fuel, net sales were $57.2 billion, up 1.3% over last year. Our gross profit rate was flat. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 26 basis points. Operating income increased 0.8% to $2.0 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $50.6 billion, up 1.6%. For the 53-week period ending January 31, 2014, comp sales increased 0.7%. Comp traffic was up 2% and ticket was down 1.3%.  Membership income increased 5.9%. This has been our strongest year of membership income growth in many years, driven by new member signups and the fee increase taken last May.  Gross profit rate was essentially flat. Operating expenses grew 3.8%. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 26 basis points. Operating income was $1.9 billion, a 1.9% increase over last year, growing slightly faster than sales.  The charges we took in Q4, along with the real estate gain, impacted our gross profit rate by 8 basis points, operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 12 basis points, and operating income by 3.9%. Excluding these items, gross profit rate increased 7 basis points, operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 14 basis points, and operating income grew 5.8%. That concludes our fiscal 14 discussion.  Fiscal 15 is now under way, and we are confident that we have the right strategy and the right structure in place to execute our growth plans. The investments we made in fiscal 14, such as transforming our merchandise offering, raising our base fee, rebalancing our field structure and accelerating real estate openings positions us well to boost our top-line performance. To accomplish this, we have three key areas of focus. First, we will continue to elevate our merchandise offering, building upon the success of home and apparel this past year. Our strategy of merchandise differentiation has resonated extremely well with our savings members, and we are excited to continue this transformation. When you visit our clubs this year, you should expect to see a strong merchandise assortment and unrelenting price leadership.  Second, we\u2019re committed to growing at the intersection of \u201cbricks and clicks,\u201d delivering anytime, anywhere access for our members. This includes two key areas of investment to propel our growth \u2013 samsclub.com and member personalization. We\u2019re going to utilize Big Data to serve our members better, and we\u2019re going to invest not only in samsclub.com, but the connection between our online presence and our clubs. Finally, the importance of delivering member value has never been greater, as we strive to become an even more valued membership organization. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities, and plan to open between 17 and 22 new, relocated, and expanded units this year. Most of our capital commitment goes to new clubs. We will, however, continue to maintain and improve our fleet by remodeling between 55 and 60 units this year.  Continued severe winter storms have resulted in a soft start to the quarter. Because of this, we expect comp sales, without fuel, for the 13- week period from February 1 to May 2, to be relatively flat. For the 13- week period last year, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.2%.  We remain optimistic about the growth opportunities at Sam\u2019s Club. The underlying health of the business is sound. The restructuring efforts implemented are allowing us to be more agile, focusing on the growth opportunities within the club channel. The strategies we have in place will deliver value to our members, helping to grow the business and drive strong financial performance in fiscal 15. Now, I\u2019ll pass things over to Charles. Charles? Charles Holley :  Thanks, Roz. Let me wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on the company\u2019s performance last year. On the positive, we delivered over $473 billion in net sales. E-commerce sales grew over 30% to more than $10 billion, including acquisitions.  Walmart U.S. continued their excellent trend of leveraging expenses. International made progress on reducing inventory. Sam\u2019s Club had solid growth in membership income. And, despite tough, sluggish economies, we grew underlying operating income over last year.  Now, we did have some challenges. Currency negatively impacted consolidated net sales by over $5 billion. Our U.S. businesses faced several headwinds this past year, including the reversal of the two% payroll tax cut, the overhang of sequestration, a reduction in government food benefits, and severe weather in the fourth quarter affected sales more than we had anticipated. All of these negatively affected comp sales.  Sluggish sales, our stepped up investment in Global eCommerce, as well as ongoing investments in our leverage and compliance organizations, made it difficult to leverage operating expenses as a company. We also did not anticipate the 26 cents of discrete items in the fourth quarter.  Now, let me frame the remainder of my comments today around the areas where we need to focus. Our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns continue to guide us. I\u2019ll begin with growth.  As Doug said, Walmart needs to be more nimble and responsive to stay ahead in the fast-changing retail industry. We\u2019re very focused on driving better customer traffic and growing comp sales. You should expect that we will continue to invest in price and improving service. We will also continue to invest in growing our store base. Small formats represent a great growth opportunity for us in many of our markets, including the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. You heard earlier from Bill about the opportunity for us to accelerate the rollout of Neighborhood Markets and Walmart Express, given their strong comp sales performance.  Customers appreciate the convenience and assortment these two formats offer, and today, we\u2019re expanding our capital allocation plan to increase the Walmart U.S. budget by approximately $600 million to accomplish this goal. It\u2019s an aggressive plan, considering that we are doing this in addition to our original forecast of large and small formats. Walmart International will continue to grow, with new store square footage predominantly across some of our key markets, including the U.K., Canada, Mexico and China. And, Sam\u2019s Club will also open between 17 and 22 clubs in the U.S. this year, building on the 12 clubs opened in fiscal 2014.  Our company will continue to invest in and grow through ecommerce. We\u2019ve already made significant progress through site enhancements, search capabilities and fulfillment. We would expect this improvement to continue. We\u2019ll also continue to make strategic acquisitions to build out our technology, talent and capabilities, and we will increase our investment when the right opportunity or acquisition presents itself. The acquisition of Yihaodian, for example, has helped us build a strong e-commerce base in China.  We expect to grow Global eCommerce sales to over $13 billion this fiscal year, with continued focus on the U.S., U.K., China and Brazil. Our websites in Canada and Mexico are starting to gain even more customer traffic. We continue to step up investments in Pangaea, our global technology platform, which helped drive sales across our retail websites in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil.  This growth is enabled by investments we\u2019re also making in fulfillment and replenishment. Our online websites had their most successful year in fiscal 2014, and we continue to offer a great omnichannel experience for our customers. We launched a new fulfillment center in Texas in September, and it exceeded expectations during the busy holiday season. We\u2019re also launching two new fulfillment facilities in Pennsylvania and Brazil in the coming weeks.  Now, let\u2019s turn to leverage. The productivity loop is the basis on which we deliver on our promise of everyday low cost and every day low price. We\u2019re committed to operating expense leverage across our businesses. We will continue to focus on being best-in-class operators, which will allow us to invest heavily in price and deliver stronger top-line results. We made significant price investments during the fourth quarter in Walmart U.S., along with all of our markets, and in this fiscal year, you should expect to see even greater investment in price leadership \u2013 whether you\u2019re a customer in London or Louisville.  We continue to receive great support from the Walmart leverage organization, and this is an area where we will continue to invest. The teams are helping us build better sourcing capabilities, implement best practices across the organization, and improve back office efficiencies. We are strengthening our ability to leverage Big Data and analytics to help us better understand buying patterns so we can put the right product on the shelf for the right time. This allows us to better anticipate and serve the needs of our customers. Let\u2019s move on to returns. Return on investment for the 12 months ended January 31, 2014 was 17.0%, down from the 18.1% we reported at this time last year. Remember that our reported results included the discrete items we\u2019ve already mentioned. If you exclude these items that accounted for 40 basis points, return on investment would have been about 17.4% when compared to the prior period. As Claire has already covered, return on investment was impacted by the decrease in operating income, investments in fixed assets, and acquisitions. Improved operating results and better management of working capital, including inventory, will drive stronger cash flow. We plan to be very focused on our working capital this year to ensure we maximize our free cash flow in the future. . : In October, we forecasted a 3 to 5% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. Additionally, all guidance provided today assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. Now, if the currency rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to net sales of approximately $3.5 billion for fiscal 2015, when compared to actual exchange rates in 2014. Because of this, and the economic factors just mentioned, we expect to be toward the low end of that net sales guidance.  During the first quarter of this year, we will begin to anniversary the increased costs we\u2019ve incurred for FCPA matters, including compliance program enhancements and the ongoing investigations. These costs will remain in the Corporate and Support area, and we anticipate expenses to be between $200 million and $240 million for the year. As you heard from Bill, we expect to incur more expense than originally anticipated from higher health care benefit utilization by our U.S. associates, and this will impact fiscal 2015 earnings by approximately $330 million.  In addition, the increased investment in Global eCommerce will be between 2 and 4 cents per share over the 11 cents we invested in fiscal 2014. As of today, we would expect currency to have a negative impact on operating income of approximately $125 million for the year.  When you take all these headwinds into account, and we adjust for the lower government benefits impacting U.S. sales, we still expect to grow operating income, although it may not grow at the same or faster rate than sales. With all this in mind, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.10 and $1.20. This compares to $1.14 last year. We expect full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.10 and $5.45. This compares to a reported earnings per share of $4.85 in fiscal 2014, which included the discrete items we told you about. Underlying earnings per share for fiscal 2014 were $5.11. Our EPS guidance is based on our forecast of the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate to range between 32 and 34%. Our tax rate will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations.  As a reminder, the pending sale of the Vips restaurant business in Mexico remains subject to regulatory approval and is now expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The Vips results are recorded in discontinued operations and the estimated future gain from the sale is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. Now, let me take a minute to provide an update on our capital plans for this year. You\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our cash and the first priority is organic growth. Accelerating the U.S. small format growth will require additional investments over what we announced in October.  So, first, we said total company capital expenditures were projected to range between $11.8 and $12.8 billion for the year. Today, we are updating this range to $12.4 to $13.4 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million for Walmart U.S. Next, we said the company would add between 33 and 37 million square feet of retail space for the year, including approximately 19 to 21 million square feet in Walmart U.S. We are now updating this range to 35 to 39 million square feet, including approximately 21 to 23 million square feet in Walmart U.S. Projected capital expenditures and square footage exclude the impact of future acquisitions. And, Bill covered the details on the change in unit counts for Walmart U.S. Our second priority for capital deployment is for strategic acquisitions. We always evaluate available acquisition opportunities that will either add to our retail platform or support our operations. As Dave discussed, we completed the transaction in Chile and now own approximately 99% of the shares of Walmart Chile.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we paid approximately $1.5 billion to complete this transaction. Additionally, continued investment in e-commerce is critical to the future of our business, and we will be opportunistic in the e-commerce space as we evaluate potential acquisitions. : As of January 31, 2014, the company had approximately $11.3 billion remaining under our current $15 billion share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be opportunistic at times with share repurchases. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity.  We\u2019ve provided a lot of information on today\u2019s call, and hopefully it helps in understanding where we are headed for this fiscal year. We are extremely focused on improving comp sales across the organization. Our investments in new stores and e-commerce will strengthen our market share position and allow us to better serve our customers. We will continue to drive expenses out of the operations and enhance productivity. And, as always, we will continue on delivering good returns for our shareholders.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The date of this call is May 15, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. [Operator instructions.] This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call. Our press release and transcript are available on our corporate website \u2013 stock.walmart.com. Additionally, starting this quarter, we\u2019ve added a supplemental slide deck that summarizes our key financial results, which is a part of and should be viewed and used in conjunction with this call. That presentation appears at the end of the transcript of this call. We believe this deck provides a more streamlined approach to reviewing our financial performance and prior year comparisons. Unit count data, which is updated monthly, is posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under the section called financial reporting. One additional item I would like to highlight is that beginning this quarter we will provide results and commentary primarily on our 5 largest international markets, all of which had revenue in excess of $10 billion in fiscal 2014. As a reminder, for fiscal 2015, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based on 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with the 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the investor portion of our website. Our Q1 reporting period ran from Feb. 1 through May 2, 2014, so our reported comp results this year are one week later than last year. Beginning this fiscal year for Walmart U.S., we will report comp sales performance based on how we currently manage the merchandise areas, rather than the six categories we have previously described. The five merchandise categories now are : Grocery, which includes food and consumables, so there\u2019s no change to this category. Health & wellness, which includes prescriptions, OTC and optical. General merchandise, which includes entertainment, hardlines and seasonal. For additional detail on these areas, please see the descriptions noted in our 10K. Apparel \u2013 no change, and last, Home \u2013 no change. For information regarding terms used in today\u2019s release including EPS, constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, please refer to our website. The sale of our Vips restaurant business in Mexico closed on May 9, and the Vips operating results continue to be presented as discontinued operations for first quarter. The net gain will be recorded in discontinued operations in Q2. Note that certain reclassifications have been made to previous fiscal year amounts and balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not impact consolidated operating income or net income. Please mark your calendar. Our Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Friday, June 6 on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. The meeting starts promptly at 7 :00 a.m. CDT and is also available via webcast through our website, stock.walmart.com, or via Walmart\u2019s free investor relations app. We look forward to seeing many of you at the meeting. And, on October 14 and 15, we will hold our annual meeting for the investment community in Northwest Arkansas. So, now let\u2019s get on to the agenda for today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will cover key results and provide an overall assessment of our business. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP of finance and treasurer, will cover the financial details for the quarter. Then, we\u2019ll cover the operating segments : Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., followed by Dave Cheesewright, president and CEO of Walmart International. Rosalind Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, will follow Dave. And then, Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with his perspective on our financial performance, and as always, he\u2019ll cover guidance. Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off our call. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. Walmart\u2019s first quarter consolidated net sales increased to more than $850 million or 0.8% over last year. Like other retailers in the United States, the unseasonably cold and disruptive winter weather negatively impacted our U.S. sales and drove operating expenses higher than expected for the company. This, coupled with the higher than anticipated tax rate, resulted in earnings per share of $1.10. Our underlying business is solid, and I\u2019m confident in the company\u2019s long-term strategies. We\u2019re making progress on building a more customer-centric organization, with a foundation of everyday low prices. We\u2019re investing in technology and our multi-format portfolio to bring Walmart\u2019s value proposition to many more customers around the world. We have a tremendous opportunity to win with the integration of digital and physical retail, as customers have the resources from us to shop on their terms. Walmart U.S. added approximately $1.3 billion in net sales compared to last year. We delivered on our comp guidance despite the impact from severe weather several times during the quarter. Our sales increased during the back half of the quarter. Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately a 5% comp. This strong and consistent performance is exciting, as we accelerate their rollout this year to complement our core supercenter fleet. Of course, we always have room for improvement. We continue to focus on our execution, both in-store and online, to provide customers with the merchandise and the shopping experience they desire. Sam\u2019s Club had a tough quarter, with lower sales than anticipated. Membership income increased, driven primarily by last year\u2019s fee increase. I\u2019m encouraged by the work underway to elevate the merchandise assortment to highlight newness and drive sales. We\u2019re also launching new services next month to make a Sam\u2019s Club membership more rewarding. A bright spot this quarter was the performance of Walmart International. Net sales increased 3.4% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019m optimistic because of the improved sales trends, and the progress we continue to make on operational efficiencies. I was really pleased with our International segment\u2019s more than 5% growth in constant currency operating income this quarter. As we focus on customer relevance, I\u2019m excited about the progress that we\u2019re making on our e-commerce initiatives. We will create transformative growth through these capabilities. Our investments are focused on improving customer experience and fulfillment capacity to provide the options that customers expect. While I was in the U.K. last month, I saw how we\u2019re innovating to win the integration of digital and physical retail. Our team in the U.K. continues to expand convenient access to the merchandise customers want \u2013 from multiple pick-up points to grocery home delivery. Shortly after I returned from the U.K., I flew to Denver to see our \u201cWalmart to Go\u201d grocery delivery and pick-up operations. It\u2019s really impressive how our e-commerce and store teams are collaborating to deliver for our customers in ways they want to be served. We\u2019re sharing global best practices across our markets to serve customers more effectively. There are a lot of good things happening in e-commerce across the globe. In the first quarter, we grew sales approximately 27%. We\u2019re seeing double-digit sales growth from nearly all of our e-commerce and mobile commerce businesses around the world. Brazil e-commerce and Yihaodian in China continue to experience strong demand. I just returned from China on Friday and was excited to see our Yihaodian team and see some of the new ideas they\u2019re working on. We\u2019re also making great progress on our global technology platform, Pangaea, and we\u2019re confident that customers will appreciate the streamlined functionality it will provide when we begin its rollout later this year. The lines between digital and physical retail have blurred and this is all ultimately about meeting and then exceeding customer expectations. At Walmart, we welcome the opportunity to lead on sustainability, but we believe that all retailers, regardless of platform or presence, have a responsibility to invest in this area. Last month, we hosted our first Sustainable Product Expo, bringing together many of the key thought leaders on this topic. And, it was an honor to join the CEOs from a number of our key supplier partners in committing to promote initiatives that advance sustainable agriculture and ramp up recycling programs in U.S. cities. On June 6, we\u2019ll hold our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, and it\u2019s great to hear from our shareholders. I also look forward to seeing so many of our associates who come from our markets around the world. I appreciate their dedication to our purpose, and I\u2019m inspired by their commitment to save our customers money and time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing to enable and empower our associates with the skills necessary to compete and providing them with the opportunity of a career with upward mobility. Looking ahead, we continue to concentrate on driving growth across the enterprise. We\u2019re laser-focused on delivering improved comp sales by sharpening our merchandising efforts, price leadership and service. Capital efficiency continues to be a priority, as we invest in our store fleet and our global supply chain. Also, as you\u2019ve seen with our 12 e-commerce acquisitions over the last 3 years, we intend to be aggressive in adding e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities, such as the purchase of Adchemy earlier this month. As we view our business through the eyes of our customers, we\u2019re working to deliver a relevant, personalized and seamless customer experience across all channels to further grow sales. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire? Claire Babineaux-Fontenot : Thank you, Doug. Today, I\u2019d like to highlight items affecting the company\u2019s consolidated financial results for the first quarter and provide a bit of color around certain other items. Additional details from a consolidated perspective are available for reference in the accompanying presentation on slides 2, 3 and 4. Severe weather in our U.S. businesses negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.03. Additionally, the company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was higher than anticipated in the full-year guidance we provided on February 20. We continue to believe our full-year tax rate will range between 32% and 34%. We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate, as it may be impacted by a number of factors. The impact of currency fluctuations continued to weigh on our results, negatively impacting net sales by $1.6 billion. As you can see on slide 2, consolidated net sales increased more than $850 million, or 0.8%. Excluding the currency impact, net sales would have increased 2.1%. Let\u2019s move on to operating expenses. Corporate and support expenses, which include core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services, increased 12.4%. As we take a closer look at the components, core corporate expenses increased 5.4%. FCPA and compliance-related expenses for the quarter were approximately $53 million. Approximately $34 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and approximately $19 million was related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. The growth in e-commerce support was driven by our investments to help expand our global technology platform to deliver an unparalleled customer experience. Our leverage services area includes investments we are making in technology, such as back office capabilities and risk and compliance management. In addition, we continue to invest in SAP to support our core operating segments, including productivity initiatives. Net interest expense increased 7.2%. The strength of our balance sheet continues to be a competitive advantage. We took the opportunity to participate in the historically low interest rate environment, issuing $4.6 billion in new debt during the quarter. We anticipate that our net interest expense will be higher for the full year than last fiscal year. Consolidated inventory increased 5%. The timing of Easter from the first quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year impacted inventory balances in many of our non-U.S. markets. You will hear more about inventory from each of our operating segments. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.2%, which compares to 85.2% last year, due to the timing of payments and higher inventory balances, including the timing of Easter. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority. Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2014 was 16.7%, compared to 17.8% last year. ROI was impacted by a decrease in operating income, as well as investments in fixed assets. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to timing of income tax payments and lower capital expenditure for the quarter. The last item I\u2019ll leave you with today is related to share repurchases. In the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 8 million shares for $626 million. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. As we examine the level of share repurchases for the first quarter, it\u2019s important to remember that in addition to our normal activity, the company also spent approximately $1.5 billion to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of Walmart Chile. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill? Bill Simon : Thank you, Claire. For the first quarter, we added approximately $1.3 billion in net sales, with relatively flat comp sales. As we indicated in February, we realized negative comp sales during the first two weeks of the fiscal year from severe winter storms. A solid start to the spring season and a strong Easter holiday drove positive comps over the remaining 11 weeks of the quarter; that\u2019s despite additional severe weather and about 50 basis points of continued SNAP-related headwind. Weather impacted Q1 comp sales by approximately 20 basis points. Overall, our comp sales were down 8 basis points, in line with our guidance. I\u2019m encouraged by the sales momentum in the back half of the quarter and with approximately 30 basis points of improvement in our comp versus Q4. I\u2019m also pleased we gained 23 basis points in market share across the key categories of \u201cfood, consumables & OTC\u201d for the 13 weeks ended April 26, 2014, according to The Nielsen Company. The entire team was focused on driving sales, launching multiple innovative initiatives that position us well in the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. Profit was challenging, down 4.3% versus last year. Severe weather-related profit impacts accounted for approximately $120 million in headwind versus last year. Additionally, health care expenses increased at double-digit growth rates, or more than $110 million, primarily from increased enrollment and medical cost inflation. We realized unanticipated double-digit percent growth in our maintenance and utilities expenses, associated with snow removal and higher utility rates and usage. Severe weather also created disruptions across our supply chain, causing freight backlog across much of the country. To keep our stores well stocked, we incurred incremental expenses for third-party transportation services and overtime wages. And, of course, we also continued to invest in price, resulting in a net 17 basis point decline in gross profit rate. Q1 inventory grew at 5.3%, primarily from new store growth and slower sales in weather-related categories such as outdoor living. We continue to monitor our inventory levels and to position ourselves well for the summer and the rest of the year. Now, let me cover the performance of our Neighborhood Markets and supercenters. Neighborhood Markets continue to perform well, delivering approximately a 5% comp sales increase for the quarter, driven by a nearly 4% increase in comp store traffic. We\u2019re seeing strength across the box, particularly in produce, meat, adult beverages, and pharmacy. Our Neighborhood Market fleet performed consistently well through the entire quarter, including throughout the periods of inclement weather. In fact, April marks the 46th consecutive month of positive comps for the format, further validating our strategy to accelerate the unit growth. Neighborhood Markets delivered solid comp sales performance regardless of the age of the store. In October, we communicated that 90% of our supercenter fleet was performing well. In Q1, these stores delivered a positive comp and improved over Q4 last year. For the remaining stores that require special attention, we\u2019ve developed unique, store-specific action plans and we\u2019re investing in leadership and additional staffing. Early indications show improvement in key metrics, with comp sales for this group up more than 200 basis points from Q3 of last year, and customer experience scores also showing consistent improvement. While we\u2019re encouraged with the early results, we anticipate this will be an ongoing work in progress. As we enter the third phase of our Walmart Express store test, we\u2019re exploring tethering this format to our larger supercenters. In this test, customers will be able to order supercenter merchandise at a rural Express store and receive it on the same day. On May 2, we opened the first fully tethered Walmart Express store in North Carolina. Customers are buying products, such as bicycles and swimming pools, which they can\u2019t traditionally get inside a 10,000-square foot box. During the quarter, we opened 13 Neighborhood Markets and 25 supercenters, including 16 new and 9 conversions. We\u2019re on track to deliver about 115 supercenters, between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets and 90 to 100 Walmart Express stores this fiscal year. We believe we\u2019re headed in the right direction. The team is diligently focused on improving sales by introducing increased innovation across the box. Just in the first quarter alone, we brought everyday low prices to the money transfer industry through our unique Walmart-2-Walmart service. We also rolled out Wild Oats, a new line of organic food products in nearly half of our stores. We launched a video game trade-in program. We expanded our Savings Catcher pilot to seven markets, and we introduced an online Walmart auto insurance comparison service. And finally, beginning Sunday, May 18, we will re-launch our Great Gas Rollback program. Now, I\u2019d like to review the performance of the various merchandising areas. In grocery, we\u2019ve seen a trend improvement despite approximately 90 basis points of headwind from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Overall grocery inflation is tracking at approximately 120 basis points. While our consumables business had a low single-digit negative comp, partly due to modest price deflation and overall industry softness, our food business delivered a positive comp. We\u2019re seeing the strongest results in areas such as meat, produce and dairy, where we\u2019re investing to keep our prices low for customers despite pressure from cost inflation. Additionally, food delivered strong Easter results, with double-digit sales growth in Easter candy and strength across other categories such as meat and eggs. Health & wellness improved more than 150 basis points versus Q4, led by our pharmacy business. Prescriptions delivered a mid-single-digit positive comp, driven by branded drug inflation and a strong increase in script counts. Script counts benefitted from new contracts in our Medicare business. Over-the-counter also improved, as a soft cough, cold, and flu season transitioned to robust allergy season. Overall, general merchandise remained soft, primarily from weather impacts and declining industry dynamics, particularly in entertainment. Our Easter seasonal business delivered high single-digit positive sales growth. However, it was not enough to offset softness within hardlines and entertainment, which had negative comp sales. In hardlines, inclement weather affected sporting goods and seasonal hardware, while entertainment continued to face challenges related to deflation. Despite industry deflation, we\u2019re encouraged by the early results of our new video game trade-in program, and we continue to focus on revitalizing our entertainment area. In the second quarter, we will re-lay our entertainment department, allocating more space and prominence to growth categories, while improving category adjacencies. Apparel continues to perform well, driven by a strong Easter and national brands. We\u2019re really pleased with active wear, and how it performed throughout the quarter with a double-digit comp, driven by our Danskin Now and Russell Athletic offering. Our shoe and children\u2019s apparel business also had positive comps, benefitting from a solid performance from national brands such as Avia, Child of Mine by Carter\u2019s, and Garanimals. Similar to apparel, home benefited from strong performance in national brands, such as Rachel Ray, Farberware, Magic Bullet, Keurig, and a broad assortment of basics. However, inclement weather drove softness in outdoor living, which includes patio furniture and live plants. Our stores are set and we\u2019re well prepared to meet customer demand as the weather improves. Overall, I\u2019m excited about the progress we\u2019ve made in both home and apparel. The team continues to enhance our assortment and expand strong, national brands to deliver value across categories. Our e-commerce business delivered double-digit sales growth and contributed approximately 30 basis points to total Walmart U.S. comp sales. Approximately two-thirds came from the walmart.com fulfilled sales and the remainder from store fulfilled orders. We saw particular strength in home, hardlines, toys & seasonal, and apparel, which was somewhat offset by softer results in electronics. Overall, we\u2019re continuing to increase our capabilities in this area. To further integrate our digital platform with our store fleet, we\u2019ve recently rolled out an e-receipts program. The initiative makes it easier for our customers to keep track of their purchases and, when combined with the Savings Catcher program, will provide an opportunity for our customers to save even more. We also recently updated our mobile pharmacy app, and we\u2019re seeing strong customer response with usage across the country. We\u2019re encouraged by the early results of our Denver grocery delivery and pick-up test, which has multiple pick-up points across 34 stores. Early sales are beating expectations and have already exceeded those of our San Francisco-San Jose pilot, which rolled out in calendar year 2011. We continued to gain momentum during Q1 in our U.S. Manufacturing initiative. To date, over 65 leading research institutions have applied for funding from our $10 million U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund. We expect the first awards to be issued by the end of calendar year 2014. Additionally, we announced that we will hold an \u201cOpen Call\u201d event in Bentonville on July 8. Current and potential suppliers can present items made in the USA to Walmart, walmart.com, and Sam\u2019s Club merchants. Registration is now open, and we\u2019re already seeing a tremendous response. We expect to find great new items we can offer our customers this holiday season and beyond. We have solid business fundamentals and anticipate our recently launched initiatives and continued price investment will resonate with the customer. However, given the challenging retail environment, we expect comp sales to remain relatively flat for the 13-week period from May 3 through August 1, 2014. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an International update. Dave? David Cheesewright : Thank you, Bill. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied with our performance in the first quarter. In a challenging global economy, our teams delivered solid sales and profit growth by focusing on expanding price leadership and providing great customer service. We remain focused on being in good businesses and running them well. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic priorities, but there\u2019s still much to do. As I\u2019ve traveled around our markets, I\u2019ve been particularly impressed with the caliber of our associates. The passion and commitment in delivering our purpose of \u201csaving people money so they can live better\u201d is clear to see wherever we operate. We continue to invest in expanding price leadership in key markets. For example, in Mexico, Superama lowered prices on more than 5,000 items and put in place a quality guarantee. In Brazil, our new advertising campaign that kicked off in February explains and reinforces to our customers in Brazil our mission of \u201csaving people money so they can live better.\u201d The value-themed ads include real life experiences from customers, as well as innovative appearances in TV shows and feature Brazil\u2019s national soccer coach. To continue this pricing momentum across the globe, we\u2019re working with third party analysts, such as The Nielsen Company, to develop consistent market share reporting. The ability to have more timely access to data helps us react even more quickly to maintain price leadership and hold customer trust. Driving the productivity loop to be the low cost operator in each market is core to our business model. The \u201cWe Operate for Less\u201d programs in China and Brazil are allowing us to offset wage inflation in those countries. In the U.K., we further rolled out the hybrid checkout system which speeds up the checkout process. Now more than half of all U.K. transactions are processed through a self-checkout. Also, we delivered on our commitment to improve operational returns. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 5.3%, which outpaced our sales growth of 3.4%. On a reported basis, operating income growth also outpaced sales. We continue to innovate and grow our e-commerce business globally, and we are delivering on our strategy of winning the integration of digital and physical. I\u2019ll discuss this more later. I\u2019m also excited about recently announced key leader moves. We have tremendous bench strength, and our ability to attract talented leaders and develop them globally, positions us to lead in our markets. Scott Price will move from being CEO of Asia to our corporate support team, leading strategy, real estate, mergers and acquisition, as well as International leverage. Our International depth gives us the ability to promote a great leader like Greg Foran to head our Asia business, a key part of our growth. Sean Clarke will succeed Greg, leading our China business. Sean is one of our most experienced executives, having served in finance and operating roles in the U.K., Canada, Japan, Germany and now China. At Massmart, Kuseni Dlamini was appointed as our new non-executive Chairman of the Board for our Sub-Saharan African business. Kuseni is an outstanding business leader, with deep experience in emerging markets and a global perspective on management and growth. Additionally, Guy Hayward was promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer for our business in Africa. Guy has a wealth of retail and financial experience and has been an integral part of Massmart\u2019s success. Now, let\u2019s get to our first quarter results. As mentioned earlier, I\u2019m pleased that we grew operating income at a faster rate than sales on a reported and constant currency basis. However, we did not leverage expenses this quarter, primarily as a result of sales challenges in a few of our markets and the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter. We\u2019ve summarized our results as we always do \u2013 on a reported and constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. For Brazil and China, we discuss stores and e-commerce separately. Slide 8 of the accompanying presentation has all the details, but let me take a minute to provide some additional insights. Of our five largest countries, Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. With the one month lag in reporting for all countries except Canada, the timing of Easter from the first to second quarter affected comp sales in countries like the U.K. and Mexico. Although we\u2019re not including detail for other markets on the slides, we will briefly mention Japan this quarter, which had a very solid performance. On a relative basis, we were somewhat encouraged with our market share performance during the quarter for our largest markets. Based on the most recent data available for the quarter, we grew our share in Canada and Mexico. We lost market share in Brazil and China, where we closed stores. Share in the U.K. declined slightly, although we gained share relative to our largest competitors. We\u2019ll provide more details as we discuss the countries individually. On a reported basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 3.4%, or 10% on a constant currency basis. With the later Easter, inventory levels increased in quarter 1 ahead of the selling period in quarter 2. Having said that, we have work to do in inventory in a few markets and we\u2019re focused on managing this more efficiently. Key financial details are summarized on slides 7 and 8. I\u2019ll discuss performance insights on our five largest markets. All of these discussions are on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis. Our net sales and comp sales declined for the quarter in the U.K. However, against a tough market backdrop, first quarter growth relative to the market improved over last year, and Asda grew ahead of its three major competitors in the 12 weeks ending March 30, according to Kantar. Even with a sales decline, operating income grew 6%, benefiting from strength in gross margin from the merchandising mix changes related to Easter. Our strategy of \u201cRedefining Value Retailing in the U.K.\u201d is built around price investment to support our core mission. Sales of \u201cprice-locked\u201d products -- essential food items where prices have been permanently reduced, were more than 15 million units every week in the quarter. We launched a new George homewares range, and early sales were ahead of expectations. With the expansion of Click & Collect, online grocery home shopping market share reached a new high of 19.2% for the period ended March 30, according to Kantar, and e-commerce sales were up more than 19.0% for the quarter compared to last year. Overall, our U.K. business continues to operate well and innovate. We\u2019re optimistic about winning in a competitive market. Also in a competitive environment, Walmart Canada increased net sales, but comp sales declined. The excessively cold weather impacted retail sales throughout the market, particularly in seasonal categories such as apparel and outdoor. Health and wellness sales were negatively impacted by lower generic prescription reimbursement rates due to ongoing drug reform initiatives implemented by various provinces, as well as higher utilization of generics. Sales were strongest in food and consumables, and according to Nielsen, we increased market share 42 basis points for the 12 weeks ended April 19. Our continued price investment resulted in an increased price gap to competitors. We\u2019re pleased with online sales as well, which delivered 134% growth. Operating income grew ahead of sales. Now let\u2019s discuss performance in our Latin American markets. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported first quarter results on April 22 under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. Our Walmex results exclude the impact of the sale of Vips, which results are recorded in discontinued operations. We received regulatory approval to proceed with the transaction and closed the deal on May 9. Walmex consolidated net sales grew 1.5% during the first quarter, impacted by the Easter calendar flip. Operating income grew 0.8%, mainly as a result of expense deleverage in Mexico, impacted primarily by the Easter flip and softer sales. Operating income was also aided by certain items. Mexico\u2019s self-service business, including Sam\u2019s Club, outperformed the market by 60 basis points in the first quarter, according to Antad. Aggressive price investments made in the Bodega Aurrera, Superama and Walmart Supercenter formats resulted in sales growth outpacing the market by 400 basis points. Our small formats, such as Bodega Aurrera Express and our stand alone pharmacies, delivered strong double-digit comps and outperformed their market peers on food and consumables. Sam\u2019s Club, which represents approximately 26% of our Mexico revenue, continues to perform below our expectations. The team is focused on reinvigorating our value proposition by providing an exciting assortment through treasure hunt and differentiated merchandise for our Advantage members, and by adding additional value for business members. In addition, we\u2019re leveraging best practices from our U.S. Sam\u2019s Club business. While we\u2019re confident about our long-term strategy, we expect Sam\u2019s Club to be challenged in the near term. Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand the Walmex e-commerce business, with additional general merchandise categories now online. Also, Superama\u2019s online grocery delivery is still growing, providing our customers with the opportunity to access via computers, smartphones and tablets. The Walmex team continues to drive the business, and in particular, we remain focused on improving our Sam\u2019s performance. Let\u2019s next talk about Brazil. I was recently in Brazil where I saw first-hand the team\u2019s alignment and commitment to stabilizing the business. We\u2019re implementing a number of initiatives to build a stronger foundation, including investments in price leadership and in improving our productivity. These investments are focused on both our retail and wholesale formats, and we\u2019re pleased with improved trends in food and consumables. We expect that as we continue to make progress, we will see similar trends in general merchandise, and will be able to drive sales growth going forward. The retail market in Brazil continues to decelerate, in line with the economy. Despite this and the Easter calendar flip, first quarter net sales and comp sales grew, and we leveraged expenses. As planned, operating income declined due to investments in key initiatives and pricing. While we still have a ways to go in Brazil, we further strengthened our talent base in key areas such as operations, finance, compliance, human resources and merchandising over the past year. Therefore, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the improvement we are seeing. Moving now to Asia, Walmart China\u2019s comp sales were negative 2.5%. This year, Chinese New Year was slightly earlier than last year, so a greater proportion of pre-holiday spending was in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding this calendar impact, comp sales would have been about flat to last year. Sales in China also faced significant headwinds from government austerity programs, which continue to curb gift card sales. Additionally, price deflation in key categories such as edible oil, liquor and infant formula negatively impacted sales. Our business transformation program, now in its third year, continued to deliver improvements to margins and reductions in expenses. We\u2019ve been able to invest in further price reductions for customers, and we increased operating income by 26.2% for the quarter. Turning to Japan, we had a strong first quarter, with both net sales and comp growth. Sales growth was aided by pre-buying ahead of the consumption tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. Walmart Japan gained market share in the first quarter and the business has continued to perform nicely, even since the tax increase. Higher sales and expense control led to 111 basis points of leverage, resulting in healthy operating income growth. So, as you can see, there are some encouraging signs in our key markets, and we\u2019re committed to continuing this progress. Last, let me give you a brief recap of our e-commerce results. We believe that our e-commerce business is one of the most dynamic in the world, and this was another strong quarter. As an example of our innovation, we further expanded the Asda Click & Collect program at over 300 Asda stores and other locations. This quarter saw further innovation with a first-to-market initiative allowing same day pick-up in 89 locations, with plans to expand to all stores this year. We\u2019re pleased with our first quarter results in China and Brazil. We continue to see strong comp growth in our China e-commerce business. Site traffic at Yihaodian grew in the triple digits, and ticket was up as well. Yihaodian sells both food and general merchandise and SKU counts are double last year, with over 3 million items now available. Yihaodian sold over 1 million liters of imported milk and set the Guinness record for \u201cthe most milk sold on a single online platform in 24 hours.\u201d This is a testament to our ability to leverage Walmart\u2019s supply chain for the benefit of our online businesses. Our growth in mobile is also impressive, as we almost reached the same number of mobile sales in the quarter as we had in the entire business last year. In Brazil, we again saw sales growth of more than twice the overall e-commerce market, and we saw record traffic growth, driven in part by new affiliate agreements. Our \u201cConsumer Day\u201d in March drove sales nearly three times that of a normal day, with strength in computers and smartphones. We continue to see record sales by mobile users, with three times the mobile sales we had last year. As a global company, we have a responsibility to lead on compliance, social and environmental issues. Over the past year, we\u2019ve made major investments in compliance. We built better processes, increased training for our associates and strengthened our organizational leadership. I\u2019m also proud to see the impact our teams make by giving back to the communities in which we operate. For example, Walmart Chile rushed to help the victims of earthquakes and wild fires that recently impacted northern and central Chile. The company sent bottled water, blankets, diapers and personal hygiene products to meet the primary needs of the victims. In conclusion, we continue to execute on our strategy of being in good businesses and running them well. Throughout the world, we remain focused on several key areas, which we shared with you in February : drive strong comp sales by expanding price leadership, create a platform for sustainable growth in China, turn around Brazil, rejuvenate Mexico, accelerate growth in e-commerce, be the lowest cost operator, and build trust wherever we operate. We see momentum in our markets, and I continue to be optimistic about the future. We have the talent, strategy and commitment to achieve success, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks, Dave. The fiscal year started with several challenges for our core member, resulting in one of our more difficult quarters. The combination of severe weather and the reduction of public assistance represented an approximate 90 basis point impact to comp sales. In addition, Q1 was marked by a rapid acceleration in inflation, as cost inflation was approximately 160 basis points, compared to 30 basis points in Q4. Despite our efforts to combat these challenges, sales did not materialize as expected. Net sales grew 0.5%, without fuel, to $12.2 billion. Operating income declined 1.4% to $477 million. Our comp for the 13-week period ending May 2, excluding fuel, declined 0.5%, comprised of both decreases in traffic and ticket. In recent quarters, our Savings member traffic has helped to offset the softness in our Business member segment. This quarter we saw positive, yet lower Savings member traffic, coupled with slower ticket acceleration \u2013 primarily in our lower to middle income members. Business member traffic and ticket remained soft. Over the past year, our merchants have been elevating the value and uniqueness of our merchandise assortment. We\u2019re seeing positive results in areas where we\u2019ve introduced newness. These areas of growth mirror current member trends around \u201cfresh, fast and fit\u201d. Let me give you some examples. Within \u201cfit\u201d, our new assortment of snacking options, which includes exclusive \u201cbetter for you\u201d choices, is helping to drive double-digit unit growth. Also, our on-trend \u201cathleisure\u201d active wear helped deliver a double-digit positive comp in ladies apparel. We\u2019ve also enhanced our private label offering by introducing new, high quality items and consolidating the existing assortment into three main labels : Member\u2019s Mark, Daily Chef and Simply Right. The recent investments are being recognized. For example, Member\u2019s Mark Ultimate Clean laundry detergent received top rankings from a leading external rating agency. While our category level merchandising results this quarter were mixed, we remain confident in our strategy to deliver more newness, more often. We are monitoring our inventory levels, which grew 7.6%, driven in part by softer sales and build-ups for new items in categories such as home and health and wellness. Within fresh, freezer and cooler, cost inflation in meat and dairy outpaced retail inflation, pressuring units and leading to a low single-digit positive comp. The late arrival of spring, along with the increased cost of beef and pork, influenced the early grilling season \u2013 an area where we have historically been strong. Within produce, hard freezes caused citrus availability issues, which were partially offset by strong strawberry and watermelon crops. Dry grocery and beverage struggled this quarter, as the decreases in total box traffic contributed to the low single-digit negative comp. While our new sweet and salty snack offering performed well, it was not enough to offset unit declines in larger categories like beverages. Ancillary categories had a negative impact on the quarter, due to sales declines in tobacco and tires. There were fewer promotional events in a leading tire brand compared to last year. Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Member awareness and usage of our pharmacy continues to grow, contributing to a high single-digit positive comp. Over-the-counter however, pressured the entire category, as we lapped strong prior year performance in diet and nutrition items. During the transition to newness, we\u2019ve experienced slight declines in consumables, recording a low single-digit negative comp. Our merchants are actively looking for ways to differentiate, particularly in pet supplies and home care, moving to products with even greater value. Within technology and entertainment, supplier inventory issues caused disruption within TVs and tablets, contributing to a high single-digit negative comp. In addition, wireless was pressured by shifting industry dynamics, as carriers change the structure of their contract terms. With Walmart\u2019s acquisition of the assets comprising Simplexity LLC\u2019s wireless activation platform earlier this month, we will be able to more efficiently support wireless activations for our members. We expect the benefits of this acquisition to materialize for both the Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart U.S. businesses in the coming quarters. Home, apparel and hardlines reported a low single-digit positive comp. While this is a slight deceleration from prior quarters, we remain pleased with our elevated assortment in this space. In seasonal hardware and gardening, new, high quality items resonated extremely well with members. Our growth was tempered by mattresses, which underperformed in geographic areas most impacted by weather, resulting in unit declines year-over-year. Samsclub.com delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, contributing approximately 20 basis points to the total Sam\u2019s Club comp. One of the contributors to this growth was Click\u2018n\u2019Pull, a free service that lets members place their orders online or by fax, and pick them up the next morning. We\u2019re revamping Click\u2018n\u2019Pull to further increase convenience for our members, particularly those with micro-businesses. We\u2019ve also begun testing \u201cMy Subscriptions\u201d, a pilot service that allows members to order items like diapers online, with discounted shipping rates. Investments such as these demonstrate our commitment to the integration of \u201cbricks and clicks\u201d and represent an opportunity to appeal to more tech-savvy members. Now back to the reported financials, excluding fuel. For our financial results including fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation. Gross profit rate declined 29 basis points due to shifts in merchandise mix and rising commodity costs. The combination of increased labor costs and weather-related utility costs contributed to a modest deleverage of 3 basis points. You may recall that last quarter, our expenses were negatively impacted by a field organization restructure. We were able to place a larger number of affected associates in open roles within Sam\u2019s Club or the larger Walmart organization than we had originally anticipated. Because of this, our severance related costs were less than our Q4 accrual, benefitting operating expenses by 7 basis points. Our operational performance continues to exceed members\u2019 expectations. According to the 2014 Temkin Experience Ratings, Sam\u2019s Club received the top ranking for best customer experience in retail. This is the third consecutive year Sam\u2019s Club has been recognized. Membership and other income remains a bright spot, growing 10.5%. Membership income by itself grew 10.9%, due primarily to the fee increase taken a year ago. In addition, Plus member upgrades and Plus member renewals performed well. In regards to Plus member growth, the South Central region has outperformed the rest of the country over the past year, due to the Plus member cash rewards pilot launched in fiscal 13. Weather related traffic trends affected sign-ups and renewals, which were soft this quarter. You may recall that we had a very successful social media event during this time last year. The members acquired through this campaign are now beginning to renew their memberships, and recent renewal rates are exceeding internal expectations. As I close, I want to emphasize our confidence in the merchandising and membership enhancements we\u2019ve made over the past year \u2013 including the transformation of our merchandise assortment and the launch of our Instant Savings book, which was ranked the #1 member benefit in fiscal year 14. With the intention of growing our member base, both through acquisition and retention, I\u2019m excited to announce the national rollout of Sam\u2019s Club Plus Member Cash Rewards, which goes into effect on June 12, 2014. This new benefit provides $10 for every $500 spent on qualifying purchases. All members will continue to receive Instant Savings offers; however, the benefit of Cash Rewards will be exclusively for Plus members. Coupled with the right merchandise and an exceptional experience, we believe Cash Rewards will further differentiate us from mass retailers and help bring us to parity within the club channel. Furthermore, we will launch a new cash-back credit card with MasterCard on June 23, 2014, offering cardholders the opportunity to earn 5% cash back on gas, 3% back on travel and dining, and 1% on everything else. This simple, industry leading program rewards members for everyday spend, making it even more valuable to be a Sam\u2019s Club member. We expect that investments like these will create a clear path for sustainable sales and member growth for the long term, but these investments, along with continued gross profit rate pressure, will be an operating profit headwind for the near term. We expect flat comp sales growth for the 13-week period ending August 1. This compares to a comp increase of 1.7% last year. Now, let me pass the mic over to Charles for our close. Charles? Charles Holley : Thanks, Roz. Let me wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some perspective on the quarter. First, we feel good about several aspects of our business. We added over $850 million in consolidated net sales. This included a $1.6 billion negative impact from foreign currency. We delivered earnings per share within our guidance, albeit the low end. Our earnings per share were impacted by the quarter\u2019s severe weather, along with a higher effective tax rate than we anticipated. Walmart U.S. comp sales results were within guidance. We experienced solid net sales growth in 4 out of our 5 major international markets. And, e-commerce sales grew approximately 27% on a global basis. Looking at the rest of the year, our teams have a clear focus on driving comp sales and delivering on our other growth initiatives. We\u2019re also committed to growing our store base. Net square footage increased to 1.1 billion square feet at the end of the first quarter, which is up 4 million square feet from the end of fiscal 2014. Because of our large base, the increase is 0.4%; however, the additional 4 million square feet is still significant. We continue to be excited about our e-commerce businesses and the rapid growth we\u2019re experiencing in this area. We continue to make progress through site enhancements, search capabilities and fulfillment, and we expect these improvements to continue. In fact, during the quarter, we opened 2 dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers -- one in Pennsylvania and the other in Brazil. We\u2019ll also continue to make strategic acquisitions to build out our technology, talent and capabilities. To put things into perspective, over the last three years, we\u2019ve acquired 12 companies, which today serve as the driving force behind the innovative work our e-commerce teams are doing. Our acquisition earlier this month of Adchemy is a great example of how we\u2019re adding talent to @WalmartLabs, as well as enhancing our capabilities in areas like semantic search, data analytics and web marketing. To be clear, our investments are not only intended to attract e-commerce customers, but also to help them navigate and shop our physical stores. With nearly 11,000 stores, over 2.2 million associates worldwide and a growing presence of highly skilled engineers in Silicon Valley, we feel we are uniquely positioned to offer a best in class e-commerce experience. Although we were not able to leverage our expenses this quarter, we remain committed to maintaining a rigid focus on everyday low cost within our operations. This will enable us to continue our price investment. The change in our working capital, specifically inventory and accounts payable, was negative. This was partly caused by a shift in Easter versus last year within our International segment. However, we do have work to do within all segments to improve our working capital performance in the future. This will be an important focus over the next few quarters. Now, you\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. Recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we increased our capital allocation plan for Walmart U.S. by $600 million to support our accelerated rollout of additional Neighborhood Markets and Walmart Express. Small stores continue to represent a great growth opportunity for us in many of our markets, including the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. Given our plan, expect capital expenditures to be heavier in the back half of the fiscal year. Our second priority is for strategic acquisitions. We always evaluate available acquisition opportunities that will add to our retail platform, support our operations or strengthen our e-commerce capabilities. Last, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As Claire covered earlier, we used $1.5 billion to acquire most of the remaining outstanding shares of our Chilean operations. This affected the share repurchase amount for the quarter. It\u2019s important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year. Next, let\u2019s move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macro-economic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to range between $1.15 and $1.25. These estimates assume currency exchange rates remain at the current levels. As a reminder, our fiscal 2015 earnings per share guidance assumes $0.02 to $0.04 per share of incremental investment in e-commerce. We began to anniversary the expenses related to FCPA matters this quarter, and we continue to anticipate these expenses will range between $200 million and $240 million for the fiscal year. In addition, it\u2019s important to remember the following with regards to our second quarter guidance. First, as you heard from Bill, in the first quarter, we incurred more than $100 million of costs from higher benefit enrollment and utilization by our U.S. associates, as well as cost inflation. While associate enrollment does fluctuate, we continue to expect these costs to be a headwind of more than $300 million for the full year. Second, we will not cycle through SNAP reductions until the end of the third quarter for our U.S. businesses, and we will continue to invest in price for our customers and members. Third, we expect headwinds for the remainder of the year from our increased investment in the Sam\u2019s Club cash rewards program and the cash-back credit card that will both launch in June. Fourth, we continue to expect our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34%. For the second quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be at the high end of this guidance. It\u2019s also important to remember that our rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year. Despite these headwinds, we remain cautiously optimistic about the second quarter and the balance of the year. Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Have a great day!

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The date of this call is August 14, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Wal-Mart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. (Playback Navigation Instructions) This call contains statements that Wal-Mart believes are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call. Our press release and a transcript are available on our corporate website \u2013 stock.walmart.com. Additionally, a supplemental slide deck that summarizes our key financial results should be used with this call. That presentation appears at the end of this transcript. We believe that this deck provides a more streamlined approach to reviewing our financial performance and prior year comparisons. Unit count data, which is updated monthly, is posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under financial reporting. As a reminder, in Wal-Mart International, we provide results and commentary on primarily our five largest markets, all of which had revenue in excess of $10 billion in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar, with our Q2 reporting period from May 3rd, 2014 through August 1st, 2014. A week-by-week comp reporting calendar is available under the comp sales link on the investor portion of our website. For information regarding terms used in today\u2019s release, including EPS, constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate also refer to our website. Throughout the discussion of our e-commerce performance, we are referring to our results on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned last quarter, the net gain from the sale of our Vips restaurant business in Mexico has been recorded in this second quarter\u2019s discontinued operations. Note that certain reclassifications have been made to Q2\u2019s results. Due to the results from discontinued operations, EPS for Q2 last year is now $1.23, not the $1.24 presented in last year\u2019s release. These reclassifications did not impact consolidated net income. There will be no EPS impact for Q3 and Q4. Please mark your calendar for our annual meeting for the investment community, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the meeting. We will kick off with dinner with management the evening of Tuesday, October 14 in Northwest Arkansas. The meeting will run through approximately 3 p.m. Central Time on Wednesday, October 15. So, now let\u2019s get down to our agenda for today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover our key results and provide an overall assessment of our business. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will cover the financial details for the quarter. Then, we\u2019ll cover our results. Greg Foran, who took over this week as President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., will kick things off. He\u2019ll be followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, who\u2019s traveling and calling in for today\u2019s call. And, Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce, will update you on the progress we\u2019ve made on our e-commerce businesses around the world. And, Charles Holley, Wal-Mart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with a focus on our guidance for the full year and the third quarter. Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off our call. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased that Wal-Mart delivered solid earnings per share of $1.21, well within our guidance range, and that our consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion over last year to $119.3 billion. As I look at our second quarter results in the context of our overall strategy, we\u2019re encouraged by the performance of our small format stores and e-commerce, areas where we\u2019re investing significantly this year. But, we wanted to see stronger comps overall in Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club. Stronger sales in the U.S. businesses would\u2019ve helped our profit performance in the quarter. We can get better operationally and we will. In an environment where customers have so many choices about where to shop and how to buy, and many of them are feeling pressure on their budgets, we have to be at our best. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to deliver a compelling customer proposition of low prices and quality service for every transaction. For many years, we\u2019ve stressed that we run this business one store at a time, and that\u2019s still true today. So, we\u2019re investing in our stores during the rest of this year to deliver positive comp sales through operational excellence. Now, let me review the second quarter results. Wal-Mart International turned in a very solid performance, with operating income up over 9% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019m pleased with the work that Dave and his team have done to manage expenses, improve profitability and drive sales. On a constant currency basis, net sales rose more than 5%, and comp sales were positive in all but one international market. I\u2019m especially encouraged by the healthy sales improvements in some of our largest markets. Our Wal-Mart U.S. business added approximately $1.9 billion in net sales and delivered a flat comp. I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re gaining traction on our goal to have a positive comp by year end, but I\u2019m not satisfied. Customers are responding to Neighborhood Markets, which delivered approximately 5.6% comps in the quarter. Operating income was pressured by investments in additional associate hours and by higher healthcare costs. We\u2019ll keep working during the back half of this year to get the combination of price investments and store associate hours right to deliver improved comp sales and serve our customers in a way that exceeds their expectations here in the U.S. Last month, we named Greg Foran the new CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. I\u2019ve worked closely with Greg for the past few years, and his depth of retail knowledge will serve our customers and associates well. As our company evolves, we\u2019re focused on delivering a customer-driven retail offering that drives sales. Greg is the best person to execute this strategy in the U.S., and I am thrilled to have him leading this effort. I also want to thank Bill for his years of service to Wal-Mart. His passion for our mission, dedication to our associates and our customers, and innovative thinking pushed us forward. From his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs to the progress we\u2019ve made with our small formats, Bill had a meaningful impact on our company for which we are grateful. Sam\u2019s Club delivered a flat comp this quarter, with net sales lower than expected. Operating income was lower than last year, due to the anticipated investment in Plus member Cash Rewards. I\u2019m encouraged by the solid growth in membership income this quarter, but I\u2019d like to see a positive comp. During a recent visit to a Sam\u2019s Club in Omaha, Nebraska, it was great to see associates energized about the club\u2019s back-to-college merchandise. They were eager to show the treasure hunt of on-trend color in home and apparel. They also helped members find the electronics and small appliances to accessorize a student\u2019s apartment. We\u2019re taking the right steps at Sam\u2019s Club to improve sales, with new merchandise offerings and localized assortment. We expect that our investment in new membership enhancements, such as Cash Rewards, will increase the membership line. Roz will cover how these programs will impact our profit comparisons over the next year. You\u2019ll hear more details from Neil in a few minutes, but there are some exciting things happening in e-commerce and mobile. I\u2019m really pleased that sales continued to be robust, growing approximately 24% this quarter. We saw double-digit e-commerce growth from our four most important markets : the U.S., U.K., China and Brazil. We continue to add exceptional talent to our teams through organic hiring and small acquisitions. To improve our customers\u2019 online experience, we recently started the rollout of a global technology platform. U.S. customers will appreciate the site\u2019s streamlined search and navigation functionality that personalize the user\u2019s experience. A better checkout process is coming in the near future. From a supply chain perspective, we\u2019ve started construction on another new e-commerce fulfillment center, this one in Indiana. Investments like these will allow timely and cost-effective delivery of merchandise to millions of additional customers. All of these initiatives are about changing with our customer. Our enterprise strategy dictates that we move with speed and agility to serve our customers more effectively. We\u2019re pushing to save them time and money, both in store and online. Because the lines between digital and physical retail have blurred, we must be nimble to adjust so that we can exceed customer expectations. Customers are rational. They respond to low prices, innovative products and the service they expect. So, we must run stronger stores everywhere we operate, with better merchandising, in-stock levels and quality service. I\u2019m confident that we can improve comp sales as we deliver on these priorities, and I\u2019m bullish on our core business. Supercenters are still relevant around the world and will play an important role for us for years to come. At the same time, we\u2019re broadening our smaller store base globally, and expanding our digital capabilities everywhere we operate. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to serve so many more customers and drive growth across the enterprise. I believe we\u2019re making good progress, but we\u2019ll keep pushing to evolve faster. Our customers expect this and we won\u2019t let them down. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire? Claire Babineaux-Fontenot: Thank you, Doug. I\u2019ll take a few minutes today to provide commentary on the company\u2019s second quarter consolidated financial results, along with certain other items. Further details are available for your reference in the presentation on slides 2, 3 and 4. First, the dollar growth in consolidated net sales exceeded $3.2 billion during the quarter : that\u2019s over $3.9 billion on a constant currency basis. Next, earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21 were well within our guidance. Consolidated membership and other income increased 8.2% to $789 million, primarily driven by strong growth in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club. Let\u2019s move on to expenses. Corporate and support expenses, which includes core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services decreased 1.6%. Core corporate expenses decreased 6.9% during the quarter. FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $43 million, which represented approximately $31 million for the ongoing inquires and investigations and roughly $12 million related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. The growth in e-commerce support expenses was driven by our continued investment in talent, technology and fulfillment. You\u2019ll hear more from Neil about the exciting work under way in the e-commerce space. Our leverage services area includes the investments we are making in technology, such as finance and HR back office capabilities and risk and compliance management, including productivity initiatives. Net interest expense decreased 2.5% over last year. A reduction in interest related to the reversal of certain tax contingencies more than offset an increase to interest expense related to higher debt balances. We continue to anticipate that our net interest expense will be higher for the full year than last fiscal year. Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 6.2%. You\u2019ll hear more about inventory from each of our operating segments. Payables as a percentage of inventory was 81%, which compares to 85.8% last year, due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority. I\u2019ll close today by providing a bit of color around returns. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, as well as our continued capital investment in store growth and e-commerce. Free cash flow increased primarily as a result of the timing of income tax payments and capital expenditures. Although the second quarter presented a few challenges, we had a number of bright spots about which we are encouraged. You heard Doug mention a few of these, and you\u2019ll hear more about them on the remainder of today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg? Greg Foran :  Thank you, Claire. Let me begin by saying how honored and excited I am to lead the Wal-Mart U.S. business. I\u2019ve learned a great deal in 35 years as a retailer and look forward to learning more about the U.S. market and from our leadership team, our customers, and our 1.2 million U.S. associates. Now, let\u2019s talk results. Q2 comp sales performance came in as expected. However, our operating income results fell short of expectations, due in part to investments in wages, as well as healthcare expenses, which were above last year\u2019s levels and above our initial expectations. Let me provide some additional detail. In Q2, net sales for Wal-Mart U.S. grew $1.9 billion. For the 13-week period ended August 1st, we delivered a flat sales comp; and this was despite a SNAP-related headwind of about 70 basis points. Ticket was up 1.1%, while traffic was down 1.1%, a 30 basis point improvement over Q1. Our e-commerce business, including store-fulfilled sales, delivered double-digit sales growth and contributed approximately 30 basis points to the total Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales growth. Our comp sales results reflect mixed performances across the business. While food was flat, health & wellness delivered positive comps. Overall grocery was aided by price investments and continued inflation. However, deflation in consumables and industry softness in entertainment created an offsetting comp headwind. Overall, I\u2019m encouraged by our solid performance during seasonal events, especially during the Fourth of July holiday. I\u2019m also pleased with the consistent strength in Neighborhood Markets and continued market share gains. In the key category of \u2018food, consumables, & OTC,\u2019 we gained 37 basis points of market share for the 13 weeks ended July 19th, according to The Nielsen Company. For gross profit, we continued to invest in price, particularly in the categories of meat and health & wellness. That investment, blended with sales mix, resulted in a gross margin decline of 7 basis points versus last year. From an operating expense perspective, the most notable headwind came from healthcare costs, which led to a 32 basis point decline in expense leverage. Healthcare costs increased approximately $180 million versus last year and were well above our initial estimates. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, the primary drivers of expense growth were increased associate enrollment and cost inflation. While enrollment was higher than anticipated, we\u2019re pleased our associates and their families continue to take advantage of our affordable healthcare opportunities. Near term, we expect continued pressure from health care and anticipate over $500 million in year-over-year expense growth for this fiscal year. During the quarter, we also allocated additional associate hours to specific areas of the store, such as front end, deli, bakery, and overnight stocking to improve overall customer service. We also sustained incremental labor expenses related to major department re-lays in entertainment and sporting goods. In total, salaries and wages were up more than $200 million compared to last year. The combination of gross margin investment and expense deleverage resulted in an operating income decrease of 2.4% for Q2. We expect operating income to remain challenged for the balance of this fiscal year, given the increased healthcare costs and our commitment to price investment and customer service. Now, let me cover the performance of our formats. During the quarter, we opened 35 supercenters, including 24 new units and 11 conversions through relocation or expansion. We plan to open, relocate, or expand about 115 supercenters for the fiscal year. In Q2, our supercenter fleet had a comp decline of approximately 30 basis points. We recognize the need to improve the performance and standards of this format to meet customers\u2019 expectations, and I\u2019ll discuss more about our strategic priorities in my closing remarks. Neighborhood Markets continued to perform well and delivered an approximate 5.6% sales comp for the 13-week period. Sales were particularly strong in pharmacy, produce, meat, and adult beverages. Comp store traffic grew 4.1%. During Q2, we opened 22 Neighborhood Markets and remain on track to deliver 180 to 200 new units for the year. Additionally, we continue to learn from our Wal-Mart Express format test and have seen continued solid comp sales performance. We\u2019ll continue to roll out this phase of our test, with approximately 90 stores expected to open this fiscal year. As a reminder, the majority of Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express units are planned to open in late Q4. We expect this will create operating income headwinds from pre-opening expenses. We also expect higher inventory balances for the back half of the year related to these openings. Across our network, inventory was up 5% at the end of Q2. Over half the increase was attributed to new store growth, while the remainder was due in part to inflation and carrying incremental inventory from recent department re-lays and modular updates. Better inventory management will be a key focus point of mine. Now, I\u2019ll review the performance of our merchandise areas. In grocery, overall inflation accelerated around 60 basis points from Q1 to approximately 1.8% in Q2. Food delivered a relatively flat comp, driven by price investments in targeted categories and regions, solid performance during key seasonal events, and inflation, which was particularly strong in deli, dairy, produce, meat and seafood. However, we continued to face SNAP-related headwinds of approximately 1.6% to food, which we will cycle in November. Looking ahead, we\u2019re continuing to adapt to changing customer needs and will launch our opening price point private label, Price First, nationwide in late Q3. With regards to the consumables business, modest deflation and industry softness led to a low single-digit negative sales comp. Health & wellness maintained its strong performance from the first quarter, improving comp sales growth approximately 1.8% from Q1. Pharmacy prescriptions delivered a high single-digit positive comp, due to strong script count growth and double-digit% inflation in branded drugs. Script count growth was fueled by new contracts in Medicare and expanded Medicaid coverage. Over-the-counter merchandise also performed well, reporting a low single-digit positive comp driven by a sustained allergy season. With respect to health services, we opened 4 health clinics as part of a new test concept. These innovative primary care clinics offer customers affordable healthcare services, including $4 basic checkups for our associates. We expect to have about a dozen clinics open by the end of the fiscal year. Our general merchandise business remains impacted by persistent industry softness, particularly in entertainment, where we had an overall double-digit negative sales comp across online and stores. The team is working to mitigate these headwinds. They recently introduced a used video game offering that complements our existing trade-in program. We also re-laid the entertainment department, placing more focus on growth categories and product innovation. In the short term, the significant scope of the re-lay created a temporary business interruption that impacted Q2 results. However, we\u2019re confident this investment is right for the customer and will benefit sales in the back half of this fiscal year. In wireless, we\u2019ve experienced recent comp declines due to a lack of innovation in phone technology and our delay in system upgrades needed to process new carrier installment plans. We\u2019re working diligently to resolve this matter. Our re-lay and wireless impacts overshadowed several favorable results in Q2, including TV comp sales, which were up low single-digits, and VUDU, which was up double digits. Also, toys delivered a low single-digit positive comp due to strength in movie-based merchandise and sports play. In hardlines, we reported a low single-digit negative comp. While our online business continued to deliver strong double-digit sales growth, our retail stores\u2019 comp sales were down due largely to lapping last year\u2019s strong sporting goods performance. With respect to back-to-school, we\u2019re pleased with our early performance and the response to our in-store teacher appreciation promotion. This program provided a 10% discount on school supplies. In our softlines business, I\u2019m encouraged by the overall performance of national brands and the growth of our softlines e-commerce business. Apparel delivered a low single-digit positive comp. This was driven by national brands and new offerings that are resonating with our customer. For example, national brands, such as Russell Athletic and Avia, drove strong performance in active wear. In addition, customers responded positively to new items and improved value in our ladies assortment. Shoes benefitted from broad assortment, including items at strong rollback prices in seasonal categories and national brands. Our home business had a relatively flat comp driven by strength in e-commerce and national brands such as Farberware, Shark, and Keurig. This was offset by outdoor living, where we lapped a high single-digit positive comp from last year. From an e-commerce perspective, we\u2019re continuing to expand our dotcom fulfillment network and recently announced plans for our third fully dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center. This e-DC will open early in 2015 and be located near Indianapolis. Additionally, last week, we rolled out Savings Catcher nationwide, which leverages our data analytics capabilities to automatically match competitors\u2019 ads and strengthen customers\u2019 confidence that they are receiving the lowest advertised price on like items. Let me shift gears for a minute and discuss our U.S. manufacturing initiative. Bill took me through the terrific work accomplished thus far. I\u2019m excited about the project and remain dedicated to our 10-year, $250 billion commitment. On July 8th, we hosted a Made in the USA open call, facilitating over 800 meetings with more than 500 suppliers. Suppliers heard from senior leadership and participated in an education series related to doing business with Wal-Mart. The results of the event were outstanding, with over two-thirds of our supplier meetings resulting in an immediate decision to purchase products, or to consider them for future buys. Later today, I\u2019ll be meeting with even more suppliers in Denver following our Wal-Mart U.S. holiday meeting to build on the work so many people have already done in our Made in the USA program. Now as we end the Wal-Mart U.S. portion of the call, I would like to speak briefly about my assessment of the business and priorities. Wal-Mart U.S. is a great business, with a deep and rich heritage in serving our customers with a smile, in clean, tidy, well-merchandised stores, with terrific low prices and value. A cornerstone of our success has been our wonderful associates, from our stores to our DCs, our Home Office and e-commerce facilities. They still are. At the core are the Wal-Mart stores, and my initial efforts will focus on the core. We will deliver against these key customer requirements : being in stock, clean stores, the right price, the right items, improved service, better productivity. I will be out in stores hearing directly from our customers and our associates and tracking our performance. I\u2019m a competitive person, so I will be visiting the market place as well. We will look to build momentum. Concurrently, we must return to growth. In the early years, a good portion of the growth will come from the current core. However, the market place is changing and we will change with it. We have substantial capabilities and assets that position us for future opportunities in the e-commerce market and in new formats. We have been experimenting for years in both the U.S. and in International. I am confident that with a disciplined approach, we will capture more than our fair share of this opportunity. While it\u2019s early in the quarter, I\u2019m encouraged by a strong start to Q3. However, we know we\u2019re in a challenging retail environment, and it will take some work to continue moving in the right direction. Given that, we expect comp sales to be relatively flat for the 13-week period from August 2 through October 31, 2014. Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Dave for the International update. Dave? David Cheesewright : Thank you, Greg. We appreciate all of the contributions you have made to our International businesses, and we are confident the Wal-Mart U.S. segment is in great hands. Every day, our associates continue to execute our key strategic initiatives. I\u2019m pleased to say that in the second quarter we delivered solid sales and profit growth, gaining market share in the majority of our markets. As I visit the markets, I see that customers are busier and changing more rapidly than ever before. Busy customers are telling us how they want to shop, and that they want us to do two things : save them time and save them money. They\u2019re looking for faster and, more importantly, convenient ways to shop. I\u2019m encouraged by our progress in driving innovation and accelerating growth in e-commerce to improve our offering and add convenience for our customers. The global economy remains challenged, which means the customer is also stretched. Price remains a critical factor in our customer\u2019s buying decisions. As an example, during a recent visit to Chile, I saw first-hand how important price is to our customers. Just a year ago, Wal-Mart Chile rolled out a mobile app, which allows customers to compare prices between Wal-Mart and competitors. We had almost 200,000 item scans in this quarter alone. We believe innovations like this and price position will continue to set us apart in the market place. We remain focused on price investment across all our markets and expect to continue driving improved comp performance. I\u2019m pleased with the trends in many of our markets, driven by a continued focus on being the lowest cost operator. In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 7 and 8 of the presentation summarize financial details. For the second quarter, we grew operating income at a rate faster than sales on both a constant currency and reported basis. We are pleased that we\u2019ve grown operating income faster than sales for the full first half of the fiscal year. These results include the charge for certain non-income tax matters of $52 million disclosed in the second quarter of last year. Even excluding this charge, operating income grew faster than sales. Net sales grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis, or 3.1% on a reported basis. Sales benefited from the Easter shift, strategic price investments, improved assortment and e-commerce growth. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9.3% and 8% on a reported basis, as most markets leveraged expenses. On a relative basis, we were encouraged by our market share performance. Of our five largest countries, only China didn\u2019t deliver positive comp sales. We also saw strong sales growth in Argentina, Chile, Japan and Africa. Inventory grew faster than sales this quarter and remains a key focus area. While a portion of the increase is related to World Cup promotional items or initiatives to drive sales in the back half of the year, I am disappointed with our position. Each market has a specific plan in place to address inventory. Now, let\u2019s discuss some market specifics. As you can see in the slide, net sales, operating income and comps are presented on a constant currency basis only. I will begin with a recap of our EMEA region, where we recently promoted Shelley Broader as the first female Regional President and CEO. Shelley brings a wealth of merchandising and operations experience and has already hit the ground running in this important region. The U.K. had a solid quarter, growing both net sales and comp sales despite a challenging market backdrop. Comp sales were up 2%, excluding fuel, and 0.5% including fuel. Despite aggressive price investments from competitors, we accelerated our performance and grew share ahead of the total market in the 12 weeks to June the 22nd, according to Kantar. In addition, The Grocer magazine designated Asda as \u201cBritain\u2019s Lowest Priced Supermarket\u201d for the seventeenth year in a row. During the quarter, operating profit declined slightly due to the lower margin mix, which was offset by strong cost control and productivity improvements. To satisfy the evolving shopping habits of customers, we introduced a more flexible management structure across all stores in June. The change places a greater emphasis on areas such as e-commerce and puts more associates on the shop floor, whilst removing historic back-office administration tasks. Strong e-commerce growth continued during the quarter, with sales up double digits. The rollout of Click & Collect to additional Asda superstores and collection sites, and the extension of store hours offer greater convenience for our customers. Next to Canada. With Shelley Broader\u2019s promotion, we are pleased to announce that Dirk Van den Berghe joined us August 1st as President and CEO of Wal-Mart Canada, bringing with him more than 30 years of international business experience and expertise in food retail. In the second quarter, Canada produced solid results in a very competitive environment. We were encouraged by our performance in food and consumables, driven by supercenter expansions. Canada net sales grew 2.9%. Comp sales were positive and improved over the first quarter, as Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s 20th Anniversary event in June favorably impacted results. Health and wellness sales also improved this quarter, with strong comps in OTC. Additionally, fresh offerings drove strong sales in food. We gained 50 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12 week period ended July 19. During the quarter, Wal-Mart Canada restructured its store associate management team to improve customer service and drive savings. Even with the impact of the restructuring charge, Canada leveraged expenses, continuing its strong focus on driving the productivity loop. However, operating income declined year over year due to headwinds in margin, from mix and price investments. Moving next to Latin America, we\u2019ll begin with Walmex. The Walmex summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported second quarter results on July the 23rd, under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. The Walmex results discussed here exclude the impact of the sale of Vips, for which we recorded a $267 million gain in discontinued operations. Consolidated Walmex sales grew 5.0% and operating income grew 5.7%. Mexico alone grew sales 5.4%, with a comp sales increase of 1.2%. Sales were driven by a favorable Easter calendar flip and strong growth in self-service formats. The net result of the World Cup was relatively neutral overall, with solid sales in electronics prior to the event, but softer sales during the 4 weeks of the World Cup. Mexico leveraged expenses for the quarter. However, operating income continues to be impacted by challenges at Sam\u2019s Club and grew at a slower rate than sales. Mexico\u2019s self-service business plus Sam\u2019s Club, grew market share by 20 basis points, according to ANTAD for the quarter ending June the 30th. This performance was driven by our self-service formats, gaining 240 basis points. It\u2019s important to note that our small formats, such as Bodega Aurrera Express, and our stand-alone pharmacies continued to deliver strong double-digit comps and outperformed their market peers on food and consumables by 12.3%. We have a solid price position, and we will continue to invest thoughtfully in price throughout the second half of the year. To address challenges in Sam\u2019s Club, on May the 30th we announced organizational changes to simplify the structure and strengthen the business. Todd Harbaugh, who has more than 20 years of experience with Wal-Mart, including 11 years in the Sam\u2019s Club U.S. business, leads the club business, reporting directly to Scot Rank. The merchandising division for Sam\u2019s Club in Mexico was restructured into two areas, grocery and general merchandise, both led by seasoned executives. Our team is laying the groundwork for a more aggressive strategy to win back members and acquire new ones. We expect continued near-term challenges, but improvement in the longer term. Turning to our Mexico e-commerce business, we celebrated the first anniversary of the Wal-Mart.com.mx site launch. We are investing to double distribution capacity in time for the holiday season, and we\u2019ve completed online technology investments with the new mobile apps for both iOS and Android. We continue to integrate our e-commerce platform with stores to create a unique shopping experience. We added 116 kiosks for customers who feel more comfortable ordering and paying at the store. We\u2019re also accelerating the growth of our grocery home delivery business, leveraging the Superama experience to expand the offering to supercenters during the third quarter. Our efforts to rejuvenate performance in Mexico delivered positive results in the self-service formats during the quarter, and we have the right plans in place to continue to improve the overall business. Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil, where we remain focused on turning around the business. Second quarter net sales rose 9.1%, with comp sales growing 9.7%, driven by a positive impact from the Easter flip and strong World Cup sales. We were encouraged by the sales performance of the food and consumables businesses and saw an improvement in general merchandise sales, largely driven by the World Cup. According to Nielsen, our market share declined for the quarter ending June 30 driven in part by store closures within the last 12 months. However, we grew comp sales faster than our largest competitor. We continued to invest in store integration in Brazil and converted an additional 80 stores this quarter to the new systems. Integration efforts simplify and standardize operational processes, giving better visibility to business results and reducing compliance risk. We are on track to have all stores fully integrated by the end of next year. Despite these integration costs, we leveraged expenses for the quarter, as the team is doing a great job focusing on operational productivity. Operating income was positive. Moving to Asia. Wal-Mart China\u2019s net sales grew 1.1%, although comp sales declined 1.6%. We continue to face significant headwinds from government austerity programs, as well as price deflation in some key categories. Despite the top line challenges, market share increased in the hypermarket category for the quarter ended June 30, and we maintained market share compared to all modern trade in China, according to Nielsen. China\u2019s business transformation program continues to deliver substantial operational benefits, allowing us to invest in price and improve our competitive position. We grew operating income significantly over this quarter last year. Wal-Mart China introduced a home delivery service in 383 stores, and customer feedback has been very positive. Average ticket for home delivery was significantly higher than the average store visit for the quarter. We are building a platform for sustainable growth in China, and we\u2019ve been working on innovative ways to deliver the best experience for our customers. Now, let\u2019s talk more specifically about our e-commerce sales. We are very excited about the innovation and growth in our e-commerce businesses around the world. As I mentioned earlier, Mexico celebrated the first anniversary of Wal-Mart.com.mx in June. Traffic grew to nearly triple last year\u2019s volume, positioning Wal-Mart.com as one of the fastest growing e-commerce retail businesses in Mexico and the third most visited, according to comScore. In the U.K., same day grocery Click & Collect is now available in most Asda superstores and 188 Click & Collect sites, and total U.K. e-commerce sales were up over 20% from a year ago. Admittedly, off a low base, Canada grew e-commerce sales by triple digits, with an expanded merchandise offer and improved customer experience. Additionally, in July we launched e-commerce sales in India to supply wholesale goods to small local businesses. The initial read in India was good, and we launched ahead of our competitors. Yihaodian, our e-commerce platform in China, grew traffic again this quarter by triple digits, and ticket growth remains strong. Net sales grew double digits. Strong sales growth in wireless and appliances drove favorable results in the quarter. In Brazil, we again saw double digit e-commerce sales growth, with very strong growth in wireless and games. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the first half results. Despite continued economic challenges and a stretched consumer, we remain well positioned in our markets for the back half of the year. We continue to be optimistic about the future and our teams around the world remain focused on our key initiatives. So, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thank you, Dave. Performance at Sam\u2019s Club improved this quarter, with approximately 50 basis points of comp acceleration versus Q1. Our business is foundationally solid and over the past year, we\u2019ve been transforming Sam\u2019s Club, with new membership enhancements, elevated merchandise, increased multichannel access, and a heightened use of data and analytics. There is still work to do, but we remain confident that these efforts will serve as a catalyst for our business, increasing the long-term value of being a member. Our top priority at Sam\u2019s Club remains growth \u2013 growing our member base and growing sales. While our top line sales growth of 1.7%, without fuel, was modest, membership income grew 11.9% in the second quarter, with Plus member renewals a primary driver. This growth is more impressive considering we have now lapped the fee increase initiated last year in May. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re taking steps to increase the value of membership. This includes our investment in two new membership enhancements, Plus member Cash Rewards and Sam\u2019s Club cash-back MasterCard, both launched a little over a month ago. This new MasterCard comes with chip-enabled technology, making the card more difficult to duplicate and providing additional security from fraudulent activity for our members. It\u2019s still early days, but member response has been positive. But, what I\u2019m most proud of is how the associates have rallied behind these programs by building relationships with members and communicating the combined value of both programs. As Doug indicated, these investments help lay the groundwork for future comp sales growth; however, they also pose an operating profit headwind over the next 12 months. The impact of recent investments, such as Plus member Cash Rewards, can be seen in our financial results, reducing both our gross profit rate and operating income. Further, we expect that this headwind may accelerate in the coming quarters as our Plus penetration grows. Now, a few thoughts on our performance during the second quarter. When we spoke last, I shared that Q1 got off to a slow start, as members were hindered by poor weather, and our clubs were impacted by higher utility costs. Our lower income Savings members were most impacted, and traffic slowed across the country. In Q2, however, Savings member traffic improved, progressing towards more historical levels of low single-digit positives. Their growth helped support the 50 basis point comp improvement that I mentioned earlier. The Business member remains pressured, delivering negative comp growth this quarter. Overall, comp traffic growth of 0.3% was offset by a comp ticket decline of 0.3%, netting out to a flat comp for the 13-week period. So, let me walk you through the financial results, excluding fuel. For results with fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation. Net sales grew 1.7% to $13.0 billion. Operating income declined this quarter by 10.2% to $466 million, due to a decrease in gross profit rate and an increase in operating expenses. Operating income, with fuel, declined 4.6%. Our gross profit rate declined 50 basis points this quarter, with 23 basis points of the decline attributable to our investment in Cash Rewards. We planned and prepared for this cost; however, the additional rate pressures from mix and price investments intensified the decline. Operating expenses grew faster than sales this quarter by 18 basis points. Several factors contributed to our inability to leverage, including higher healthcare benefits costs versus last year and increased real estate expenses associated with opening 5 new clubs this quarter, versus 1 new club during this time a year ago. Membership and other income grew 10.5%, driven by upgrades and Plus renewals. Late in the quarter, we launched a social media initiative to drive new membership growth. We had almost 130,000 people respond to the offer, which ran from July 21 to August 1. While the majority of the offer redemptions will cross into the third quarter, we have been pleased by the number of new members who have already come into the club to officially activate their memberships. Inventory management remains a priority for us, with inventory increasing 4.7% this quarter. Builds for new clubs and an earlier set for fall seasonal merchandise contributed to the growth. Now on to our merchandising results. Our buyers have been working hard to elevate our merchandise assortment, procuring new items at incredible values for our members. We\u2019ve seen good results in areas of the business where we have introduced these new items, such as \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d snacks and apparel. Some of our core categories like tobacco, wireless, and candy, however, remain pressured. Fresh / freezer / cooler delivered a positive low single-digit comp, led by solid performance in dairy, fresh meat, and cooler areas. A competitive pricing position and successful 4th of July holiday weekend boosted our fresh meat comp, as members responded to our high-quality assortment of steak, ground beef, and chicken. We continue to see inflation in dairy; however, unit growth was minimally impacted. Grocery and beverage posted a negative low single-digit comp. The snacks category continues to perform well, driven by \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d indulgences within nuts, trail mixes, chips and popcorn. We are pleased with our recent efforts to assort clubs based on member preferences within wine and spirits, representing over 100 basis point improvement in comp performance over the prior quarter. The growth was tempered by declines in candy and beverages, which were hindered by the deceleration in Business member traffic. Ancillary, which includes tobacco, declined low single-digits. Tobacco comp sales decelerated, despite a May price increase, with units down mid-single digits. Health and wellness delivered a positive low single-digit comp. The overall category was lifted by the high single-digit comp in pharmacy, as investments in member value and awareness over the past several quarters continue to drive growth. Within optical, an increased focus on opportunistic buys resulted in a strong assortment of new \u201cfashion sun wear\u201d items \u2013 all at a great value for our members. Over-the-counter is a focus area, as we continue to lap extremely strong prior year performance in diet and nutrition items. We have recently introduced several new items in OTC, including new nutrition bars for our health-conscious members, and initial results are promising. Some of the consumable categories, such as pets and laundry, struggled this quarter, as we continue the transition to newness. This transition period resulted in a negative low single-digit consumables comp. However, our long-term focus on higher quality, better pack-size value and newness continues to accelerate results in the disposable tabletop and paper goods categories, leading to double-digit share gains over the 52-weeks ended July 19, as measured by The Nielsen Company. While still a negative high single-digit comp overall, we are beginning to see comp improvement within our technology and entertainment subcategories. Our merchants have been surrounding core items, like TVs, with new and exciting tech items, and the results are beginning to show. For example, we\u2019ve added new SKUs within the portable audio category, which had a positive effect on the quarter. We\u2019ve seen comp declines in wireless, as system upgrade delays have affected our ability to provide new carrier installment plans. Home, apparel, and hardlines reported a positive mid-single-digit comp this quarter, led by a strong double-digit comp in kitchen electrics and a high single-digit comp in mattresses. You may recall that mattresses struggled last quarter, underperforming in areas of the country most impacted by weather. Our merchants worked hard to change their approach this quarter, adding a new king size SKU to our assortment with a strong price-point. Member response was clearly positive! Apparel and jewelry continued their exceptionally strong track record \u2013 delivering their fifth straight quarter of positive comps. Samsclub.com delivered another solid quarter, contributing approximately 30 basis points to the total segment comp. Double-digit sales growth was seen in both direct-to-home and Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull formats, and conversion rates improved across all access points. This quarter, we re-launched all four mobile platforms, providing easier access and simplified shopping for our members. This includes a completely new iPhone app launched in June, with features that allow Plus members to check their Cash Rewards balance on-the-go. Based on member insights, the mobile team is now releasing new enhancements and updates every 4-6 weeks to ensure the best possible experience. Speaking of experience, our operations team recently launched a new in-club initiative to provide \u201clegendary member service.\u201d At Sam\u2019s Club, our members have a higher expectation of service because they pay to shop our clubs. The \u201clegendary member service\u201d concept is simple \u2013 we want to ensure that our members are engaged and have a memorable shopping experience with us. We continue to be optimistic about the future of Sam\u2019s Club, knowing that we have laid the groundwork for success. We expect comp sales to be slightly positive for the 13-week period ending October 31. This compares to a 1.1% comp increase last year. Just one week ago, we hosted our annual holiday meeting with our field management teams here in Bentonville, Arkansas. Let me tell you, the teams left feeling energized and ready to serve our members. At every level of the organization, we\u2019re laser-focused on 3 key priorities : continued elevation of our merchandise assortment, growing our member base, and strengthening e-commerce, which includes mobile. We\u2019re building momentum at Sam\u2019s Club and remain confident in our ability to deliver positive comp sales during the second half of the year. I\u2019ll now pass it over to Neil. Neil? Neil Ashe :  Thanks, Roz. Our e-commerce businesses made significant progress on our strategies and delivered a number of customer-focused enhancements in our core markets. Globally, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% in the second quarter. I\u2019m excited about the capabilities we\u2019ve delivered and how we are integrating the digital and physical worlds to offer customers easier and more convenient ways to shop. We\u2019re working closely with the operating segments around the world to make all of this happen. Looking at Wal-Mart U.S., we saw double-digit sales growth, and we continued to outpace the e-commerce market overall. The major highlight was that we started to roll out a new Wal-Mart.com site experience. To the consumer, it\u2019s simpler, it\u2019s faster and it\u2019s easier shopping experience. But, it also represents a major technical feat that involves a top-to-bottom rebuild of our entire global technology platform. I\u2019m also really excited about the rollout of Savings Catcher. It\u2019s a perfect demonstration of how we are integrating digital and physical experiences to do the work for our customers, and it reinforces their trust in Wal-Mart\u2019s low prices. The Sam\u2019s team is moving aggressively on enhancing the digital and physical experience for members. The new iPad app is getting rave reviews from the members, going from 3.7 stars to 4.5 stars in the app store. We\u2019re also seeing great momentum in the office category and with the Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull program that allows members to order online and pick up in a club. We had double-digit sales growth in Brazil, in Mexico and Chile, and triple-digit growth in Canada and Argentina. Of course, we saw a lot of TV sales leading up to the World Cup, but the pleasant surprise was the sales lift in games as a result of good demand for consoles. In China, Yihaodian delivered high double-digit growth rates in sales for the quarter, and its focus continues to be on the quality of the customer experience. To support these efforts, we completed 40 projects in the quarter, including Customized Message Services for customer support. And, our customer satisfaction reached a new high of 97.7%. Yihaodian\u2019s marketplace business 1Mall also more than doubled. In addition to the successes in each market, we\u2019re seeing great progress on building out a world-class e-commerce organization and delivering on our strategic initiatives. On the talent side, we continued to strengthen our Global eCommerce leadership team. Fernando Madeira, who was our President of Latin America eCommerce, became President and Chief Executive Officer of Wal-Mart.com, with responsibility for the U.S., Latin America and further growth of Wal-Mart.com. We also created a new Chief Operating Officer role for Global eCommerce and are thrilled that Michael Bender, formerly president of the West for Wal-Mart U.S., is now in this role. He will drive operational excellence as we scale our e-commerce businesses and will oversee the expansion of our next-generation fulfillment networks. With these additions and others, I feel great about the depth and breadth of experience at the leadership level, as well as throughout our organization. We\u2019ve continued to have great success in hiring some of the best technologists in Silicon Valley and around the world. And, we supplemented our hiring with small, targeted acquisitions, including Adchemy, Stylr and Luvocracy this past quarter. Our talent density is helping us deliver best-in-class technology. We\u2019ve talked about our global technology platform and how it is a top-to-bottom rebuild of everything that powers our e-commerce sites and businesses around the world. We\u2019ve been delivering a lot of elements of the tech platform this year, but most of those have been technology that customers don\u2019t see, sitting under the hood. What they will now start to see is a new site experience for Wal-Mart.com in the U.S. We previewed the site at a mom blogger day at our Sunnyvale office, and they loved it. One of them, Leticia, was saying how visually appealing the site looked and how much easier it was to find products. Input from customers helped us design the site and will help us continue to make it even better. The tech platform gives us much greater speed and flexibility. Changes to the site can be made in minutes versus days, so we can innovate, test, iterate and deploy new capabilities in real time. The site has much more personalization, and each customer\u2019s experience is always changing with fresh content that helps them discover new items. We\u2019ve built our own personalization engine to customize the experience. Customers now receive relevant options and recommendations, while they are on the site, and via email and text messages. And, given that more 30 than half of traffic to Wal-Mart.com is coming from mobile devices, we designed the site to adapt to any size device, particularly tablets. In addition to the new global technology platform, we\u2019ve been focused on building our next-generation fulfillment networks around the world to deliver orders faster and more efficiently. We have a new large-scale fulfillment center under construction in Indiana, which will complement those we\u2019ve opened in Texas and Pennsylvania in the past 12 months. We also enabled 20 more stores to fulfill online orders during the quarter, and 20% of units ordered on Wal-Mart.com are now shipped from stores. Our algorithms are helping to determine the optimal shipping point, whether from an online fulfillment center, a store DC or a store. And, in Brazil, we opened a new fulfillment center in Cajamar that is now fully operational. We will announce additional fulfillment centers around the world over the coming months. We\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making on our strategic goals, and our investments are delivering for Wal-Mart\u2019s customers. We are pleased that we are growing faster than the market. And, this growth is coming during a time that we are rebuilding almost every aspect of our e-commerce businesses \u2013 building out our team, new global tech platform and next generation fulfillment networks. We expect to see fluctuations as we go through this work, and we\u2019re keeping our eye on the long-term. We started the year with a goal of 30% full-year sales growth. We\u2019re expecting that growth to be in the mid-20s. And, we expect higher growth in our third-party marketplace businesses. The opportunity for e-commerce is clear and we are stepping up our investment in our e-commerce businesses for the rest of the year. I will now turn it over to Charles for guidance. Charles? Charles Holley :  Thanks, Neil. We are now half-way through this fiscal year, and while we have some challenges, we are encouraged by several aspects of our business. Let me cover those examples. During the quarter : Consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion, with Wal-Mart U.S. contributing $1.9 billion of the increase. Wal-Mart International delivered a solid performance, with positive comp sales in all but one market and strong operating income. Earnings per share of $1.21 were well within our guidance. Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the quarter and the year were flat, an improvement over the prior year\u2019s string of negative comps. We\u2019re also pleased that traffic improved. And, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% on a global basis. The challenges that we face are reflected in our revised guidance, and I will go through those now. In addition to continuing global macro-economic challenges, there are several specific items that will continue to be headwinds for us in the back half of this year. First, during the quarter, our U.S. healthcare costs increased $180 million versus last year and were well ahead of our initial estimates. This increase is a result of higher enrollment by our U.S. associates and families, as well as healthcare cost inflation. Enrollment does fluctuate with our hiring. As a result of this increased expense, we now anticipate the impact to be approximately $500 million for the fiscal year, which is approximately $170 million higher than our original estimate of approximately $330 million provided in February. That estimate was included in our full year earnings per share range of $5.10 to $5.45. Second, as you just heard from Neil, e-commerce is particularly important to both our customers and our company\u2019s future, and we will continue to invest in areas such as technology, talent, and fulfillment. As a result, our fiscal 2015 earnings per share now assumes $0.05 to $0.07 of incremental investment versus our prior guidance of $0.02 to $0.04. I would like to add that, although we are slightly revising our e-commerce sales growth to 25% for this year, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we are making on our strategic goals. From a tax perspective, the estimate of our full-year effective tax rate remains between 32 and 34%. For the third quarter, we expect our rate to be around 34%. While historically our rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year, it\u2019s important to remember that assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits and the impact of discrete items could affect our rate. We are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2013, which if not passed, could drive our effective tax rate towards the high end of our estimated range for the full year. As we shared with you last quarter, we are investing in Sam\u2019s Club this year. We will continue to support our two new membership enhancements at Sam\u2019s with investments in the Plus member Cash Rewards and the cash-back MasterCard, which both launched in June. As Roz indicated earlier, while these investments will position the business better for the long term, they do pose an operating profit headwind over the next year. Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the full year to range between $4.90 and $5.15 per share, versus our prior guidance of $5.10 to $5.45. This assumes third quarter EPS to range between $1.10 and $1.20 versus $1.14 last year. Our estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels. Now, before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. Returning value to our shareholders is clearly one of our financial priorities. In the second quarter, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $307 million of our shares. Our operating results heavily influenced our share repurchase activity. As we look at the level of share repurchase for the first half and the remainder of this year, it is important to remember that we spent $1.5 billion to acquire most of the remaining outstanding shares of our Chilean operations, and that we committed an additional $600 million to accelerate small format openings in the U.S. The change in our working capital, specifically inventory and accounts payable, negatively impacted our cash from operations. Improving our working capital performance is a priority for all of our operating segments. With that, thank you for your continued support and interest in our company. Have a great day.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015. The date of this call is November 13, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. For those listening on the phone, you may navigate through this call as follows. (Operator Instructions) This call contains statements that we believe are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call. Our press release and a transcript of this call are available on our corporate website stock.walmart.com. Additionally, a supplemental presentation that summarizes our key financial results should be used with this call. That presentation appears at the end of the transcript. We believe the presentation provides a more streamlined approach to reviewing our financial performance and prior year comparisons. Unit count data, which is updated monthly, is posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under Financial Reporting. It is worth noting that last Wednesday, we opened our 5,000 unit in the United States, a Neighborhood Market in Greenbriar, Arkansas. In the Walmart U.S. discussion today, we refer to traditional Neighborhood Markets, which are grocery stores that average 43,000 square feet and include a pharmacy. The smaller Neighborhood Markets we refer to are those ranging in size from 12,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet and are what we formerly called Walmart Express stores. As we previously announced, existing Express stores are being rebranded this quarter to Neighborhood Market. Going forward, the Neighborhood Market brand will be used for the grocery small format, regardless of square footage, unless otherwise noted in our financial releases. In Walmart International, we provide results and commentary primarily on our five largest markets by revenue. For fiscal 2015, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar, with our Q3 reporting period from August 2 through October 31, 2014. A week-by-week comp reporting calendar is available under the comp sales link on the investors\u2019 portion of our website. We will report a 13-week comp for this fiscal year\u2019s fourth quarter versus the 14-week comp period we reported last year. For information regarding terms used in today\u2019s release including EPS, constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, refer to our website. Throughout the discussion of our e-commerce performance, we also are referring to results on a constant currency basis. We announced our earnings reporting calendar for next fiscal year and those dates are posted on our website as well. So let\u2019s get to our agenda for today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will cover key results and provide his thoughts about our enterprise strategy and the business. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer will cover the financial details for the quarter. Then we will cover our segment results. Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. will kick things off. He will be followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International, and then Roz Brewer, our President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO will wrap up with a focus on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full-year. Now, I\u2019m very pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon to kick off the call. Doug? Doug McMillon : Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Walmart reported solid earnings per share of $1.15 in the third quarter, and our consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion over the same period last year to $118.1 billion. I\u2019m encouraged that Walmart U.S. reported a positive comp for the quarter and that our Neighborhood Market stores continued to show strong sales. Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s and International\u2019s operating income grew faster than sales growth, and global e-commerce sales increased about 21%. But we need to continue to improve the customer experience both in our stores and online to deliver stronger sales growth and strengthen our bottom line performance. Now, let\u2019s review our third quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. added $2.3 billion in net sales. Since the beginning of this year, you\u2019ve heard me say that our focus was on delivering a positive comp by year-end. I\u2019m encouraged that comp sales were positive in Q3, but we are still not satisfied. We have areas to improve, including in the customer experience and in our price leadership position and we are taking the steps necessary to fix these areas. Greg and the leadership team are intensely committed to driving short-term improvement through the urgent agenda items and he will share an update on this important work. Operating income declined due to increased healthcare expenses, investments in e-commerce, and investments in price. Walmart U.S. appeals to customers across all income levels, and they all want to get the best value. Our Savings Catcher program continues to help us reach more of these value-driven customers. The cost relief from lower fuel prices presents a potential benefit for customers and could continue to help them during this holiday shopping season in addition to helping our own business. Sam\u2019s Club delivered strong operating income growth this quarter, due primarily to an increase in membership income and expense leverage. We would like to see stronger sales, but I\u2019m encouraged by the progress in membership and the strong pace of renewals by our Plus Members. Members are responding to our ongoing investments in merchandise and in services, as well as the overall membership value proposition. Walmart International turned in a solid performance, growing operating income faster than sales, one of our key metrics. I\u2019m especially pleased by the sales improvements this quarter in Canada, both sequentially and over last year. The investments we\u2019ve made to remodel our stores and drive supercentre expansion are resonating with customers. During the quarter, I traveled to Asia to see how things are progressing in China and Japan. In a supercenter in Beijing, customers shared how they appreciate the quality of our fresh meats and produce. I got a kick out of watching our associates show our Chinese customers how to use avocados to make guacamole. The world is shrinking right before our eyes. While our customer feedback in China is improving, one customer when asked what we could do better, mentioned she can sometimes find diapers and formula cheaper online. Customers all over the world are integrating how they shop. They don\u2019t see the same lines of separation some of us might focus on and this is a great opportunity for Walmart. Increasingly, we are seeing it just how they do. In Japan, our customers are responding to value. It\u2019s clear why our comp sales have been better when you walk these stores and see the items and prices. Our fresh food in Japan looks great. Last week, I dropped into some stores in Chicago including a new Neighborhood Market in an urban area. A customer stopped me to thank us for the value we\u2019ve brought to his community and it was interesting for me to see some of the similarities and differences of our fresh food offer compared to what I\u2019d seen in Japan. We are learning across markets and can do even more of that to improve our fresh offering in all of our markets. It\u2019s a key point in our enterprise strategy going forward. In that same store, another customer strongly encouraged us to add more organic produce. She was right; we needed more. We\u2019re seeing opportunities large and small to get better. Interactions like this often remind me how similar our customers are around the world. Everyone is interested in getting quality products at a value. Walmart makes a difference in people\u2019s lives. From a customer perspective, the lines between digital and physical retail have blurred. For me, it was another reminder of the great opportunity we have to use our 11,000 stores and digital capabilities globally to save our customers money and time. With our goal of greater access and an improved customer experience, we are strengthening our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. This is an investment period for Walmart, which can create short-term turbulence in service and impacts our e-commerce sales. This quarter, we saw solid e-commerce growth from our key markets and we are pleased with the progress in markets like Mexico and Canada. We continue to roll out our new global technology platform to provide streamlined search and navigation functionality. And, construction continues on our new fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Brazil. I\u2019m excited about all the opportunity we will have to serve customers in new and better ways as we get these global e-commerce capabilities fully installed. As you heard at our Annual Investor Meeting last month, we are focused on an enterprise strategy designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience for our customers. It\u2019s what they want and we will give it to them. This strategy includes four customer dimensions : price, assortment, experience and access. Being the price leader across a broad basket of goods is important because value conscious customers from all income demographics around the world want to save money. We\u2019re also focused on having the right assortment, both in store and online. Our customers want to be able to buy just about anything from us, so we are expanding our e-commerce assortment to give them that opportunity. In the area of service, we\u2019re investing to provide a shopping experience at Walmart that exceeds customer expectations. For access, we are developing the capabilities to save our customers time and give them the choices they want by integrating digital and physical retail in ways that are convenient for what they want at that moment. The way these four dimensions come together represents our plan to win. We\u2019ll be able to give customers what they want and how they want it. We\u2019re thankful to be able to continue our progress addressing challenges in key areas of global responsibility. We have a great team of associates. Walmart creates a ladder of opportunity for each of us. We promote a lot of associates each year to jobs of greater responsibility and higher pay. Whether your job is to serve customers in Beijing, Tokyo or Chicago, you can grow in your role and build a career at Walmart. In our communities around the world, I\u2019m pleased that both our customers and associates will help make the holidays and the New Year brighter for those less fortunate. Through partnerships with organizations like CARE, Salvation Army, Feeding America and Operation Homefront, Walmart is giving back to the communities we serve. As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we made in the third quarter. Saving people money and time drives our decisions. The future looks bright for Walmart. We\u2019re making the necessary changes and moving with appropriate speed to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire? Claire Babineaux-Fontenot: Thanks, Doug. I\u2019ll cover results of the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation released today as a part of the earnings transcript. Total revenue for the quarter exceeded $119 billion, as consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion, or 2.8% along with membership and other income growth of 13.9%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 3.5%, primarily due to continued investments in wages and higher U.S. healthcare-related expenses. FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $41 million, which represents approximately $30 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and approximately $11 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $69 million for the third quarter. Through the third quarter of this year, we have spent $137 million on FCPA and compliance-related costs versus our guidance of between $200 and $240 million. We expect to be near the low end of the guidance for the full-year. As you may see on Slides 2 and 3, net interest expense increased 13.1% for the quarter. This is primarily the result of the reclassification of certain store leases from operating to capital. Additionally, the company\u2019s effective tax rate was 31.8%, below our previous guidance of around 34% due to certain discrete tax matters. So while we benefited in the quarter from a lower tax rate than anticipated, this benefit was offset by a number of discrete charges. In addition to the capital lease interest charges, we had some unique operating expenses in the quarter, which include organizational restructuring charges in the UK and Hurricane Odile losses in Mexico. Dave will discuss those later. From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 3.7%. Later in today\u2019s call, you will hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 77.0%, which compares to 79% last year due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority. I will conclude today with a comment about returns. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, as well as our continued investment in store growth and e-commerce initiatives. Free cash flow increased primarily as a result of timing of income tax payments and capital expenditures. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. Greg? Greg Foran : Thank you, Claire. Over my first 100 days, I\u2019ve been visiting our stores and competition across the country and evaluating the U.S. business landscape. I\u2019ve spent time with our frontline associates and leadership teams, and I\u2019m encouraged by what I see. There are some areas where we really are excelling and our performance reflects this. However, I still know we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. To summarize the U.S. business as I see it today, comps have improved, but sales and operating cost headwinds remain, impacting both top and bottom line performance. We will partially offset these headwinds in the fourth quarter by making progress on the urgent agenda items that I presented at the Investor Meeting last month. We have opportunities to become better shopkeepers, to execute the everyday business better. And finally, we are developing long-term plans for the business. These actions will take time, but I believe they will make us a stronger business, and allow us to sustainably grow beyond our fair share of opportunity. Now, let\u2019s turn to this quarter\u2019s performance. Net sales grew $2.3 billion, or 3.4%. For the 13-week period ended October 31, comparable sales were up 0.5%. This is the first positive comp for the Walmart U.S. business in seven quarters despite approximately 70 basis points of impact from SNAP-related headwinds. Ticket was up 1.2%, while traffic declined 0.7%. Note that traffic improved 40 basis points from Q2 and 70 basis points from Q1. Within the business, we\u2019ve had several areas driving top line growth. First, we\u2019re encouraged by sales performance during key seasonal events. We started the quarter with a strong back-to-school program across categories in apparel, home, and traditional back-to-school supplies. And we ended the quarter well, executing a strong Halloween event. This led to positive performance in seasonal categories, including costumes, seasonal d\u00e9cor, and candy. Throughout the quarter, we experienced comp sales growth in home and apparel, driven by newness across the categories. We have a strong good/better/best strategy, accented by strong brands, which translated into positive results. Health and wellness continued to be a bright spot for us driven by double-digit branded drug inflation and script count growth, due to the more preferred Medicare plans. OTC was also strong in categories, such as pain management and seasonal allergy. Within store formats, we are pleased by the Neighborhood Market performance particularly in our traditional format, which reported approximately a 5.5% positive comp for the quarter. Pharmacy and consumables continued to produce strong growth, as we focused on in-stock and optimizing the store with relevant offerings for the customer. In our e-commerce business, we are being thoughtful about sustainable growth in this channel. E-commerce, including store-fulfilled sales, contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Whilst our comp performance shows some progress, we still have opportunity to improve. Our overall grocery comp, which includes food and consumables was relatively flat. Net inflation increased approximately 210 basis points versus last year, primarily led by meat and dairy. Offsetting the majority of this inflation were SNAP-related headwinds and customers trading down in high-inflation categories. In the key category of food, consumables, and OTC, we gained a small increase in market share for the 13 weeks ended October 25, according to The Nielsen Company. Entertainment had a high single-digit negative comp. This was driven by industry softness and deflation and further compounded by lapping major releases last year in video games and movies. Additionally, a delayed launch in our wireless systems capabilities impacted our ability to offer mobile handset installment plans. We expect these systems to be in place in Q4. We are, however, encouraged by early results from the recent relay of the entertainment department and have seen quarter-over-quarter improvements in key categories. Overall, I would characterize the quarter\u2019s sales performance as mixed. Whilst I\u2019m encouraged by several emerging trends and I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about our Q4 top line performance, I know we have additional work to improve down our side counters and within our everyday business. Shifting to the remainder of our financial results, gross profit rate declined 22 basis points. This was driven primarily by pharmacy cost inflation and reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates. Additionally, we\u2019ve continued price investment in key categories such as meat and preferred Medicare plans in pharmacy. Operating expenses were primarily impacted by higher healthcare- related costs versus last year. Additionally, we were purposeful not to overextend wage leverage, while focusing on improving customer service. Overall, operating expenses deleveraged 10 basis points and coupled with the decline in gross margin rates and ongoing investments in e-commerce led to a 1.2% decrease in operating income. Let\u2019s move next to inventory, which was up 5.2% at the end of Q3. More than half of this was due to new store growth and a conscious decision to flow inventory through our diversified import network early for the upcoming holiday season. This allowed us to minimize risk of delays and mitigate impact to our holiday business. We\u2019ve taken recent actions with respect to reducing inventory, but it\u2019s too early to see any significant impact. However, we are reasonably confident that we will see an improvement in inventory levels over the next year. Now, let me discuss our real estate actions this quarter. We opened 49 supercenters, including 33 new and 16 conversions, as well as 28 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets in Q3. In Q4, we will shift to a heavier mix of small formats, opening over 100 traditional Neighborhood Markets and 70 smaller ones. Given the significant number of Q4 openings, we expect headwinds related to pre-opening expenses, as well as higher inventory balances from these openings. Shifting gears now, I would like to talk a little about Q4. I\u2019m encouraged by our momentum on the urgent agenda items. We\u2019re already seeing improvements in how we execute markdowns related to damaged merchandise, particularly in produce, as we focus on improving freshness for our customers. Plans are emerging to deliver a strong in-stock position, while simultaneously managing inventory levels appropriately. Though profit will remain challenged, we are working to partially offset some of the expressed headwinds. For the holiday season, I\u2019m excited by what I see in our stores. Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and we are prepared to make it a great day for our customers and their families. As we revealed this week, we are excited for The New Black Friday at Walmart. This year, we\u2019ll have five days of fantastic deals and tailored events, including the return of our industry-exclusive one-hour Guarantee program. We have the most popular toys, thanks to our Chosen by Kids program, and we continue to provide customers with easy ways to purchase everything they need for the holidays, including ordering online for pick up in store and a free layaway program with no opening fees. We will also have exciting offers both in-store and online for Cyber Monday, as we deliver an integrated digital and physical experience. I\u2019d like to personally thank all of our 1.2 million strong associates, who are engaged and energized for the season. This year our associates will be easy to spot, as they wear their Walmart vests with pride. Additionally, we will hire more than 60,000 additional seasonal associates to help provide great customer service, and we will implement our Checkout Promise, ensuring more registers are open than ever before. All of these actions will reinforce the levels of service our customers need and appreciate. As we enter the fourth quarter, we see both opportunities and challenges ahead of us. We lapped the approximately 6% reduction in SNAP benefits on November 1. Additionally, gas prices are considerably lower this year than a year ago, which may give customers a little more discretionary spending power in the coming months. And as I just discussed, we are enthused by our holiday plans across the box and online. However, we expect this holiday season to be highly competitive, and we are mindful that the entertainment business, which comprises a larger percentage of overall Q4 sales is up against continued deflation and a lack of new product innovation. We\u2019ll continue to see pressures to the bottom line as we balance wage leverage with higher customer service standards. We recognize we have opportunities to improve the business, but we also know that these things will take time to ensure that they are executed properly and in the best interest of our customers. We continue to work hard on longer-term plans, and I know that by being purposeful in our actions, we will come out stronger, gaining more than our fair share of the opportunity. For these reasons, we expect comp sales in the fourth quarter to be between flat and positive 1% for the 13-week period ending January 30, 2015. Last year, Walmart\u2019s comp sales declined 0.4% for the 14-week period ended January 31, 2014. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for the International update. Dave? David Cheesewright : Thank you, Greg. Overall, we had a solid third quarter, once again growing operating income faster than sales and gaining market share in most of our largest markets. While sales growth slowed some on a constant currency basis compared with the first-half of the year, sales trends improved in the latter part of the quarter in markets such as Canada and Mexico. Customers remain challenged across most of the globe, but our teams continue to do a great job of serving these customers by helping them save time and money. The team is aligned on key strategies that we discussed in the October Investor Meeting. We\u2019re making significant progress on driving price leadership and widening or maintaining our price gap across key markets. We\u2019re excited about steps we\u2019ve taken this quarter to accelerate growth in e-commerce, including the launch of additional online offerings in Mexico and China and collection points for online customers in the U.K. and China. We also remain focused on being the most trusted retailer wherever we operate. For example, Walmart China recently launched a Worry Free Fresh program starting with 49 stores providing our customers with a money-back satisfaction guarantee when buying fresh produce and meats. On October 30, we announced the future closing of around 30 underperforming stores in Japan that will allow us to continue to focus on the key elements of the business, such as e-commerce, price leadership, and fresh. While these decisions are never taken lightly, we will continuously assess our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are focusing our efforts on the things that matter most to our shareholders and customers. Though there is always room for improvement, we feel good about our third quarter results. Net sales grew 2.9% on a constant currency basis or 1.7% on a reported basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 5.2% on a constant currency basis and 3.7% on a reported basis. We did not leverage expenses for the quarter in part due to continued investments in e-commerce and other initiatives, but leveraging expenses remains a key priority. On a relative basis, we were encouraged by our market share performance in most countries, which we will discuss further in the individual market sections. Of our five largest countries, Canada, Brazil and Mexico delivered positive comp sales, but comps declined in the U.K. and China due to retail deflationary pressures. Net sales and comp growth were strong in some of our other markets, including Africa, Argentina, Central America, Chile, and Japan. We made some progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter, dropping from 11.2% year-over-year growth in Q2 to 7.2% in Q3. While we are encouraged by the improvements made in some of our key markets, we still have work to do. Now, let\u2019s discuss individual results for key markets. Net sales growth and comp sales are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details. The UK market remained challenging throughout the quarter. Aggressive competitive activity resulted in an overall market decline over the 12 weeks ended October 12, according to Kantar. In this environment, Asda continued to perform relatively strongly and was the only one of the big 4 grocers to gain share this quarter. Comp sales declined 1.8%, excluding fuel. Supermarkets performed ahead of expectations, and we saw success in George home categories and Click and Collect which we continue to expand aggressively. Operating income grew ahead of sales due to favorability in margin and other income. We did not leverage expenses due to lower sales and some organizational restructuring costs taken during the quarter. In Canada, we accelerated growth versus the first-half of this year, with comp sales growing 0.6% and net sales up 3.3%. Fresh performed particularly well, with double-digit growth due to our increased grocery presence via new and converted stores. General merchandise sales also improved versus Q2 driven by entertainment. In an increasingly competitive environment, Canada gained 20 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ended October 18. Canada grew operating income 3.5%, outpacing sales growth. We leveraged operating expenses 9 basis points through continued focus on lowering costs. Moving next to Walmex, which released their quarterly results on October 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP; thus some numbers will differ. Consolidated Walmex sales grew 4.2% with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex operating income decreased 10.4% due to approximately $25 million in expenses related to the effects of Hurricane Odile in August. Mexico sales grew 4.2%, and comp sales were up 0.6% for the quarter outperforming the industry. Excluding Sam\u2019s Club, self-service outperformed the market by 250 basis points and gained share across our main store divisions according to ANTAD. Grocery comps exceeded the market by 340 basis points, and general merchandise increased 150 basis points. In addition, our small format, Bodega Aurrera Express, outperformed its market peers with a 12.6% comp for the quarter. We maintained a solid price position and attractive assortment, which we believe will help us win in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on turnaround efforts in our Mexico Sam\u2019s Clubs. Our success will depend on building our membership base and establishing a strong foundation for the future. This quarter, I\u2019m happy to report progress against some of our key objectives with positive member base growth each month of Q3, and reduced inventory. We still have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m pleased that we are seeing some progress. As mentioned earlier, the Baja region of Mexico was significantly impacted by Hurricane Odile. I\u2019m extremely proud of how the Walmex associates and Walmart de Mexico\u2019s Foundation stepped up to support the local community providing 60 tons of food to the Mexican Red Cross and opening collection centers in our stores in several states of Mexico. Walmex also provided support to affected associates. Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil. Despite an overall economic deceleration in Q3, comp sales grew 0.8%, with net sales down 0.7%, as a result of closing underperforming stores last year. Despite the overall sales decline, the management team continued to make great progress on reducing operating expenses, resulting in operating income improvement. We remain focused on strengthening the business in Brazil by building a business model that is simple, scalable and profitable. We restructured leadership teams where necessary and enacted process changes in merchandising to leverage local market knowledge when making decisions. Store integration progress continued, with the recent completion of the conversion of all stores in South Brazil to unified systems and processes. These actions helped drive the comp sales growth, expense savings, and profit improvement so far this year. Moving to China. Walmart China\u2019s Q3 net sales declined 0.8% and comp sales declined 2.3%. Sales remain challenged as we, along with all retailers, continue to face significant headwinds from government austerity, reduction in gift card sales, and deflation in key categories such as dry grocery, liquor, and consumables. Despite the top line challenges, Walmart China grew sales at a faster pace than the market in the hypermarket category for the quarter ended September 30, according to Nielsen. Walmart China also made great progress in strengthening the core of the business. Initiatives to increase supply chain centralization by adding fresh and grocery distribution centers will be completed by the end of this year. Centralization reduces shipping costs, enhances quality of fresh products, improves inventory management and delivers goods to stores more timely. Walmart China\u2019s operating income was flat with last year. We anticipate continued sales pressure in China for the fourth quarter from deflation and government austerity measures, as well as from the timing of Chinese New Year, which will fall nearly three weeks later than in the current year. Finally, let\u2019s discuss our progress in e-commerce across the globe. Accelerating e-commerce growth is a key priority and future growth will depend on innovation and driving grocery home shopping. The third quarter marked the launch of online grocery delivery sales in the greater Mexico City area, and the pilot of a third-party online OTC pharmacy site in China that\u2019s part of Yihaodian\u2019s offering. In the UK, e-commerce sales were up 20%. We provided more convenience for customers through the Click and Collect rollout, with a record 148 new locations opening this quarter, including six additional London tube stations. Ongoing price investments drove strong grocery home shopping sales growth of 18.6%, despite annualizing against significant growth last year. Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China had strong sales growth. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. Consumer electronics drove growth with strong performances in wireless and appliances, and the third quarter was highlighted by Yihaodian\u2019s Anniversary Sale with sales increasing more than 50% compared to last year\u2019s event. In Brazil, e-commerce sales grew strongly again. As a result of closer partnerships with key suppliers such as Sony PlayStation and Electrolux appliances, sales in games and home nearly doubled. In addition, focused marketing on new moms in the baby categories contributed to strong consumables growth. The August Black-Out Event, a Black Friday-like promotional event was a great success. The event was more than twice as large as last year with six TVs, seven mobile phones, and one Xbox 360 sold every minute. We were also pleased with e-commerce results in Mexico, as online sales grew 66% over last year albeit off a fairly low base. The new grocery delivery option offers 30,000 items from 14 categories, including fresh, dry grocery, consumables and pharmacy, and caters to customers of 75 stores in and around Mexico City. Orders can be picked up in store or delivered. We\u2019re also making significant investments in talent, marketing, technology and fulfillment. We saw encouraging results in general merchandise, where almost 20% of our sales are done through 150 kiosks at Walmart Supercenters, giving customers who feel more confident ordering and paying in stores an attractive alternative to paying online. We remain committed to our key initiatives in order to deliver a solid fourth quarter performance. The market teams have exciting plans in place to serve our customers better than ever. For example, in Mexico, where we have a very strong presence in toys, we are offering a double price guarantee on toys sold during the Christmas season. In Japan, we will stock the shelves with popular Fortune Bags, similar to grab bags, in preparation for the New Year holiday, giving customers a surprise for a great value. We remain optimistic about our ability to serve our customers around the world, and in continuing to deliver solid results. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks Dave. Sam\u2019s Club delivered strong profit growth this quarter with operating income up 5.3% without fuel and 12% with fuel. We\u2019ve continued to execute strategic investments in membership, merchandise newness, and the intersection of digital and physical. Sam\u2019s posted a comp increase without fuel of 40 basis points for the 13-week period ended October 31. We\u2019re pleased that this growth represents a cumulative improvement of 90 basis points over the 39-week period. Although we have lapped our fiscal year 2014 fee increase, our third quarter membership income growth remained strong at 10.1%. Clearly, our members have continued to respond positively to our efforts to enhance membership value. Since June 2014, the launch of Cash Rewards has improved our Plus penetration by about 4 percentage points. Additionally, our operators have really gotten behind our 5 :3:1 cash-back MasterCard, which is not only chip-enabled to protect our members from fraud, but also stands as the best cash-back program in the market today. Along with instant savings, these programs speak to our commitment that a Sam\u2019s Club membership is the most valuable card in the members\u2019 wallets. Now, let me review our financial results and highlights from the quarter, excluding fuel. For results with fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation. In Q3, comp sales increased 0.4% driven by relatively balanced growth in traffic and ticket. Traffic remains up among the Savings members, with pressure from fewer trips within our Business members. Retail inflation across the club averaged low single-digits with inflation higher in certain areas such as dairy and meat, offset by deflation in other areas, including technology. Net sales grew 2.3% to $12.7 billion, and operating income grew 5.3% to $455 million. Our gross profit rate declined 43 basis points this quarter with a significant portion attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. This pressure will continue as Plus member penetration grows. Similar to Q2, mix also contributed to the decline. We leveraged this quarter, as operating expenses grew slower than sales by 35 basis points. This has been largely due to lower remodel costs and pre-opening expenses with four clubs, including expansions, opening this quarter compared to 13 during last year. However, healthcare-related expenses were higher year-over-year. Membership and other income grew 9.9%. Plus member renewals and upgrades were strong, offsetting softness in the business member base. Lower oil prices contributed to higher fuel profit of $38 million. Consistent with industry trends, Sam\u2019s Club sees fuel profits increase as oil prices fall, and decrease as oil prices rise. In both scenarios, we provide significant member value through our gas stations, not only giving members the best price per gallon, but also an additional 5% off all gas purchases through our Sam\u2019s Club MasterCard. This year, we\u2019ve been working to bring inventory growth in line with sales growth and we saw results. An increase of 1.3% with fuel, an improvement since last quarter reflects better inventory flow. Bringing in on-trend newness in key categories has brought our merchandise to life this quarter. Let me give you a few examples. There is great work in newness going on across our food business. Both areas grocery/beverage and fresh/freezer/cooler delivered positive low single-digit comps. We have significantly expanded our organic portfolio this quarter, and plan to more than double it by the end of the year. Other new items such as Chia Seeds, breakfast bars, and squeezable fruit pouches hit on key trends, healthy, on the go, and exciting, and members have responded. In freezer, convenient frozen meats, fruits, seafood, and vegetables have shown strength as well, appealing to our members\u2019 desire to save both time and money. Similar to last quarter, inflation in dairy and meat remained particularly in red meat, where we\u2019ve seen members shift to value items such as chicken and ground beef. Additionally, produce results have been mixed due to a stone fruit recall, deflation in potatoes, and weather shocks that pressured various items in the category. For our members, newness is also about excitement. In home, apparel, hardlines, which posted a positive low single-digit comp, we have updated the calendar to fill in some of the gaps between major seasonal events. Our home event in August and early set of holiday merchandise in September impressed members and reinforced Sam\u2019s Club as a holiday shopping destination. Apparel, including our exclusive active wear brands, children\u2019s wear, and fall outerwear continued to generate excitement as well. Health and wellness accelerated this quarter delivering a positive mid single-digit comp driven by both script growth and inflation from the brand and generic mix. Members truly see Sam\u2019s Club as a trusted source for healthcare needs from pharmacy to health screenings to healthy-for-you products. I\u2019m particularly delighted that our pharmacy teams have been recognized by an industry research firm as the number one provider of pharmacy services amongst mass merchandisers. Our continued momentum in pharmacy is clear evidence of this well-deserved recognition. Over-the-counter was boosted by healthy-for-you protein products, including protein powder and protein drinks, which appeal to our members\u2019 active lifestyles. So as you can see, newness is working across categories and we are working even faster to infuse newness in other areas of the business as well. Comp sales of consumables, which declined low single-digits is an area where we are working to improve results. While tabletop and bags continued to perform well due to pack size expansion and strategic pricing. The consumables category was pressured by inventory issues in our private label pet business, as well as a recall in baby wipes. Technology, entertainment and office comps declined high single-digit comps, but showed improved performance in the wireless category, compared to last quarter. Specifically, a strong Apple 6/6+ launch, and the implementation of new technology to process members\u2019 wireless contracts supported this improved wireless performance. Our merchants are focused on consumer electronics, which will keep our momentum going through the holiday season. Ancillary, which includes tobacco was essentially flat for this quarter. While still down year-over-year, the improvement from Q2 is due to unit growth in tobacco driven in part by shifts in the competitive landscape. Our online business continued to perform, demonstrating our progress in furthering the integration of digital and physical. Samsclub.com contributed approximately 20 basis points to the total segment comp by means of its double-digit sales growth in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, as well as improved conversion rates from across most access points. I\u2019m proud of the progress our teams have made to integrate the digital and physical. This October, we launched Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull, rebranding it as Club Pickup, to make it that much easier for members to shop with us just in time for the holiday season. It\u2019s a service that our Business members have always loved and now we are expanding it to appeal to all members. From the online Easy Reorder tool to new check-in kiosks at all clubs, members can complete a trip to Sam\u2019s Club in a matter of minutes. What\u2019s more, Club Pickup is yet another touch point for our members to experience legendary member service both in-club and online. What I find really encouraging is our reengagement with the Business member through a suite of services that help our small business members save money and time on vital day-to-day business needs. For example, we know that only a small fraction of microbusinesses is able to fund employees\u2019 healthcare insurance, instead relying on outside benefits or paying out-of-pocket. Now, our small business members can provide employees with affordable health care plans through the Aetna Marketplace for Sam\u2019s Club. Furthermore, they also have a trusted source for legal solutions from LegalZoom as well as payroll services, merchant payment processing, and travel booking. And we believe that savings members will also take advantage of some of these services, especially the travel. The digital foundation supporting this is the Samsclub.com platform. Our team released significant new features this quarter. Desktop site enhancements, unit price visibility, and smooth integration for third-party services have further improved the platform\u2019s ability to migrate members online, and guide them through the browsing and purchasing process. I\u2019m proud of our recent accomplishments at Sam\u2019s Club and even more thrilled about the growth to come in our clubs and online. In the fourth quarter, we will lap last year\u2019s headwinds from SNAP reductions and severe weather impacts. We expect comp sales to be between flat and up 2% for the 13-week period ending January 30, excluding fuel. This compares to a decline of 0.1% last year. When you come visit us in the club this holiday season, you will see our focus on delivering newness across the box. Our merchants and operators are excited about our holiday plan and poised to deliver strong results to close out the year. It all begins in just two days with our November 15 Holiday Savings Celebration, so I hope to see you out in the clubs. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charles. Charles? Charles Holley : Thanks, Roz. Overall, we are encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter. We continued to focus on driving stronger sales and improving customer service. Let me summarize the key takeaways from the third quarter. Earnings per share of $1.15 were at the midpoint of our guidance. Walmart U.S. delivered its first positive comp in seven quarters. Consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion, with Walmart U.S. contributing $2.3 billion of the increase. Walmart International once again grew operating income faster than sales, and we gained market share in most of our largest markets despite the economic conditions in those markets. Sam\u2019s Club delivered operating income growth of 5% without fuel, due to stronger membership income. E-commerce sales grew approximately 21% on a global basis and we made initial progress on working capital management an ongoing priority for all of our finance teams. Now, let\u2019s move on to guidance for both the fourth quarter and the full-year. Our earnings guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and a highly promotional holiday season, especially in the U.S. As a reminder, our full-year earnings per share guidance includes the four factors we discussed last quarter, which were higher than anticipated healthcare costs in the U.S., incremental investments in e-commerce, ongoing investments in Sam\u2019s Club, and our effective tax rate, which we expect to range between 32 to 34%. Last quarter, we shared that the incremental investment in e-commerce for fiscal 2015 is expected to range between $0.05 and $0.07 per share. Year-to-date, we have incurred approximately $0.04 per share of the incremental investment. On October 15, at our Investor Meeting, we also shared with you that we plan to step up our investments again next fiscal year given the priorities we have for digital and mobile commerce in our enterprise strategy. As I indicated last quarter, while historically our tax rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year. It\u2019s important to remember that assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits and the impact of discrete items could affect our rate. In particular we are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2013, which if not passed could drive our effective tax rate towards the high end of our estimated range for the full-year. Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range between $1.46 and $1.56. This range includes approximately $0.03 per share related to the previously announced closure of underperforming stores in Walmart Japan. In addition, remember we will have continued headwinds from healthcare expenses as well as the remainder of our incremental investment in e-commerce. As a reminder, last year, Walmart reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.34, which included a negative impact of approximately $0.26 from discrete items. Therefore last year\u2019s fourth quarter underlying earnings per share were $1.60. With that, let\u2019s move on to guidance for the full-year. As we indicated at the recent Analyst Meeting, we now anticipate net sales growth for fiscal 2015 to range between 2% and 3% versus our prior guidance of being at the low end of our stated range of 3% to 5%. And as of today, we would expect foreign currency to have a negative impact for the full-year of more than $4 billion. In addition, today we are updating our guidance for full-year earnings per share to range between $4.92 and $5.02. This revised guidance includes approximately $0.03 per share of charges related to the closure of underperforming stores in Walmart Japan. This compares to our prior guidance of $4.90 to $5.15. Last year, we reported full-year earnings per share of $4.85, which included the $0.26 of discrete items I mentioned earlier. Therefore our full-year underlying earnings per share last year were $5.11. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We paid $1.5 billion in dividends this quarter and spent approximately $82 million to repurchase our shares. It is clear that our operating results influence our cash flows. Our cash position will improve as we have better performance from our U.S. operations and improve working capital management. Our entire team is focused on being disciplined in delivering for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. And on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season.

Claire Babineaux-Fontenot - Executive Vice President and Treasurer Greg Foran - President and Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S. David Cheesewright - President and CEO, Walmart International Rosalind Brewer - President and Chief Executive Officer, Sam\u2019s Club Neil Ashe - President and Chief Executive Officer, Global eCommerce Charles Holley - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Carol Schumacher : Hello, this is Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Global Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today. The date of this call is February 19, 2015. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. [Operator Instructions] This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call. Before we get under way, we apologize for the delay in this morning\u2019s release. We normally release our earnings at 6 :00 AM Central Time, or 7 :00 AM Eastern. However, because we wanted to share some exciting news about our U.S. associates with them first, we delayed the release until now. So, this morning, we have several pieces of news to share with you. First, we have details on the fourth quarter and the full year results for fiscal year 2015. Second, as we normally do, we provide guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Third as I mentioned, we\u2019re announcing a new wage structure for hourly associates in Walmart U.S. stores and Sam\u2019s Clubs. This new initiative, including training and educational programs, will affect current and future hourly associates in the United States. And last, we\u2019re announcing our annual dividend for fiscal year 2016. You\u2019ll hear more from Doug and our leaders about each of these items. All materials related to these announcements are available on our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. For earnings, please review together the earnings press release, the transcript of this call and the accompanying slide presentation. Unit count data, which is updated monthly, are posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under financial reporting. As indicated last quarter, it\u2019s important to note the definition of a Neighborhood Market. Traditional Neighborhood Markets are grocery stores that average 42,000 square feet. The smaller Neighborhood Markets, range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet, and are still part of a test concept and not included in comp sales. As a reminder, for fiscal 2015 which ended January 31, 2015, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. In Q4 we reported a 13-week comp versus a 14-week comp period reported last year. Our Q4 reporting period began on November 1, 2014 and ran through January 30, 2015. Consistent with industry practice, we did not adjust the reported fiscal 2015 comps. Comps were based upon 13-week and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the investors\u2019 portion of our website. Now recall that last fiscal year\u2019s earnings per share were impacted by $0.26 of discrete items. This year, as you\u2019ll note in our earnings release and on this call, earnings per share were also impacted also by $0.08 of discrete item. Additional information regarding underlying EPS and other terms used in today\u2019s release including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website. Let\u2019s get on with today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover key results, an analysis of our successes and challenges, and the news about our wage structure changes and training programs. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will provide context for the financial details not included in the accompanying slide presentation. Then we\u2019ll cover the three operating segments, Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club; Neil Ashe, president and CEO of Global eCommerce, is joining the call this quarter to provide an analysis of how we did for the year, along with insights on our strategic investments for fiscal year 2016; and, Charles Holley, Walmart CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of fiscal year 2015 and guidance for fiscal year 2016. Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to share some exciting news with you today. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thanks Carol, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Walmart U.S. delivered better than expected comp sales. Sam\u2019s Club had its best performance of the year, and Walmart International had solid sales and profitability. The dedication of our associates around the world to serve customers was evident again in this busy fourth quarter. Now clearly, our sales benefitted from customers having more spending power due to lower gas prices in most of our large markets. In addition, product inflation and more favorable weather were a tailwind to U.S. comp sales. But, like many other global companies, we faced significant headwinds from currency exchange fluctuations. So, I\u2019m pleased that we delivered fiscal year revenue of nearly $486 billion, but we\u2019re not satisfied. We have work to do to grow the business. We know what customers want from a shopping experience and we\u2019re investing strategically to exceed their expectations. Our priority is to run great stores, clubs and e-commerce everywhere we operate. And we\u2019ll continue integrating our stores with our e-commerce and mobile commerce business. One of our most important priorities this year is improving the customer experience. Today, we announced a bold new initiative on pay and training to invest in our U.S. store and club hourly associates. For several months, our leadership teams have been developing and testing new ideas to reward associates for their service to our customers and give them clearer pathways for opportunity. We\u2019re pursuing a comprehensive approach to our hiring, training, compensation, scheduling programs and store management structure that is sustainable over the long term. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam\u2019s Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of the current fiscal year. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today\u2019s federal minimum wage, or $9 per hour, in April. The following year, by February 1, 2016, current associates will earn at least $10 per hour. We\u2019re also realigning our store operational structure to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors. Associates will have more ownership over their schedules. In addition, we\u2019ll provide them with more resources and training to enable merit-based career advancement and higher levels of pay. Of course, for a number of years, associates have had the opportunity for competitive health-care and 401(k) benefits, as well as access to bonus incentive opportunities, discounts, and educational programs. These programs will continue to be available to current and future associates. We\u2019re also launching an innovative program for future associates that will allow them to join Walmart at $9 per hour or more, receive skills-based training for six months, and then be guaranteed at least $10 per hour upon successful completion of that program. Sam Walton used to say that, our people make the difference. I share the same philosophy. Overall, these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores. As a result, we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience, which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time. Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business and we want to make sure that\u2019s the case going forward everywhere we operate, including here in the United States. Globally, we have ongoing efforts in place to review our associates\u2019 compensation on a yearly basis in each of our markets. For example, in China, we recently launched the compensation structure for stores and clubs; and in this year, we are launching a new compensation structure for our distribution center associates to improve the overall competitiveness of our practices. Later this year, Walmart Mexico will launch training programs to give the associates more ownership and accountability, so they can react faster to customers\u2019 needs. Included in today\u2019s announcement, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation also committed to $100 million over five years to help increase the economic mobility for entry level workers by focusing on initiatives to better train and advance workers in the retail and other service industries throughout the United States. As we look at our business through the lens of the customer, our enterprise strategy is helping us define where our additional investments are focused. While we\u2019re concentrating on running a good business today, we\u2019re also clear on how we should position it for the future. Value matters to everyone, regardless of household income level, and digital access creates even more price transparency. Being the low price leader has been a part of our customer proposition and it will continue to be a priority in the future. We\u2019re also evaluating our assortment and our approach to service, both in stores and online, to be relevant for today\u2019s customer. And, we\u2019re testing various access points to provide convenience and allow customers to shop on their terms. This past quarter, we initiated a number of work streams that will deliver on these key initiatives. I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019ll accomplish over this next year as we drive our enterprise strategy. Now, let\u2019s review Walmart\u2019s financial results in more detail. Walmart U.S. improved its sales and operating income trends each consecutive quarter during fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter comp sales were the strongest in more than two years, with positive traffic for the first time in nine quarters. Our Neighborhood Markets have continued to deliver strong comps. Our emphasis remains on the quality of the stores that we open, not the quantity. I\u2019m pleased with the strategy that Greg and his team are executing to raise the standard of customer experience in the U.S. business. They\u2019re taking steps to enhance store operations on various fronts, including inventory management, check-out, and in-stock. For the holidays, Walmart U.S. implemented a Checkout Promise to keep more registers open during peak periods, and customer response has been positive enough that this has continued into the first quarter. I\u2019m encouraged by the focus of the leadership team, and I look forward to seeing more progress in our stores this year toward a better experience for our customers. Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales and operating income growth this year. Dave and his team have done a good job weathering a tough macro environment. Canada\u2019s sales gained momentum in the back half. In China, we made progress in store operations and in e-commerce. We continue to earn customers\u2019 trust with our commitments to food safety. There\u2019s so much potential for this market and we\u2019re taking the right steps to solidify a foundation for long-term growth. The UK market remains very competitive, and Asda is committed to its \u00a35 billion five-year investment to lower prices for customers. We\u2019re making progress in Mexico. There\u2019s still work to do in Brazil. Sam\u2019s Club had a solid year, with membership income up over 10%. Comp sales, without fuel, continued to improve throughout the year. And, operating income, with fuel, grew at a greater rate than sales. Roz and the team made good progress on the ongoing merchandise transformation, embedding new, on-trend and exciting merchandise into the clubs and online. Members are responding by driving sales in these categories. Members are also pleased with the new, innovative services that were launched this year to increase the value of a Sam\u2019s Club membership. You\u2019ll hear more from Neil shortly about the strides that we\u2019re making in our e-commerce customer experience, assortment, and supply chain. We\u2019re leveraging technology to strengthen our e-commerce and mobile capabilities, and integrating these digital assets with our more than 11,000 stores globally. Overall e-commerce sales grew approximately 22% in fiscal year 2015; solid, but not quite as strong as we wanted. We\u2019re striving to balance sales growth and profitability. We\u2019re being thoughtful with our investments, ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to build this business for the long term. I\u2019m excited about the possibilities that are in front of us. One of the headlines in e-commerce is the tremendous growth from mobile devices. In fact, nearly 70% of walmart.com traffic in the U.S. came via mobile during the recent holiday period. Customers who previously shopped using their laptops are now using their phones and tablets. And this isn\u2019t just a U.S. trend, for example, traffic from the mobile app in Brazil nearly tripled on the Black Friday holiday. Around the world, we\u2019re well-positioned to create a strong mobile experience for customers this year and beyond. As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I\u2019m proud of the accomplishments of our associates and leadership team. It\u2019s been a period of change for the 2.2 million associates that make up the Walmart team, but it\u2019s been inspiring to see our associates rally around our company\u2019s purpose. Last week, more than 5,000 members of our U.S. store leadership gathered for our annual year beginning meeting. I heard directly from our store managers how we could help them run better stores. And, similar meetings are occurring around the world. Regardless of our responsibility, we\u2019re in this together. Each of us has a role to play in making our customers\u2019 shopping experience a great one. Our secret to success continues to be that we\u2019re all working together. We made a lot of progress on bringing strategic clarity and in reinvigorating our commitment to run better businesses today. Retail is changing so quickly that we must move with greater urgency to stay out in front. I like the passion that I\u2019m seeing from our leadership team as they work together to shape and deliver our enterprise strategy. We\u2019re thinking differently about retail, and about the world. This drives our approach to global responsibility in areas like environmental sustainability, women\u2019s economic empowerment and offering healthy food choices. It\u2019s important work and it matters to our customers and shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance, ethics and doing the right thing. I\u2019m pleased with the technology enhancements we\u2019ve made to strengthen these organizations. As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m proud of what we accomplished this past year, but I\u2019m more excited about what lies ahead. The deliberate strategic choices that we\u2019re making around investments in our associates and e-commerce capabilities will improve the customer experience. And, we believe that shareholders will also benefit from these investments in the future. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire. Claire? Claire Babineaux-Fontenot: Thanks, Doug. Today, I\u2019ll highlight some items in the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. Before I begin, let me remind you that last year, the company\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS were negatively impacted by certain discrete items totaling $0.26. The company\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 EPS were negatively impacted by discrete items totaling $0.08. A wage and hour litigation matter previously disclosed resulted in a charge of $0.05 per share, and store closures in Japan resulted in a charge of $0.03 per share. A reconciliation of company\u2019s underlying EPS is included in our earnings press release issued prior to the call. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, underlying EPS was $1.61, compared to last year\u2019s underlying EPS of $1.60. Reported EPS was $1.53, compared to last year\u2019s EPS of $1.34. As you can see on Slide 2, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $131.6 billion. Consolidated net sales increased $1.9 billion or 1.4%, and membership and other income declined 0.5%. Recall that during the fourth quarter of last year, membership and other income was positively impacted by a $24 million gain from the sale of certain U.S. real estate assets. Total revenue for the year grew to $485.7 billion, as consolidated net sales increased $9.2 billion, or 1.9%, and membership and other income grew 6.3%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 0.5% for the quarter, and 2.3% for the full year. It is important to remember that operating expenses were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and for the full year by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Additionally, FCPA and compliance related costs were $36 million in the fourth quarter, comprised of $26 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $10 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. For the full year, FCPA and compliance related costs were $173 million, comprised of $121 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $52 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, total FCPA and compliance related costs were $282 million. The company\u2019s consolidated operating income increased 8.2% during the fourth quarter. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by the discrete items I mentioned earlier. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased 1%. Net interest expense increased 5.8% for the quarter and 6% for the year. The increase for each period was primarily driven by a higher weighted average interest rate on net borrowings. From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 0.6%. Later in today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 85.1%, which compares to 83.4% last year, due primarily to the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important and we are seeing progress as the company continues to focus on this priority. We ended the year with capital expenditures of $12.2 billion, slightly below our range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. For the year, the company added approximately 33 million retail square feet through 511 net new expanded and relocated units. This was in line with the updated guidance we shared in October. Finally, let\u2019s address returns. ROI for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2015 was 16.9%, relatively flat compared to 17% for the prior comparable period. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. For the full year, the company returned $7.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And, we ended the year with free cash flow of $16.4 billion, compared to $10.1 billion last year. Now, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg? Greg Foran : Thank you, Claire. When I joined the Walmart U.S. team six months ago, we laid out specific objectives for the second half of fiscal 2015. We knew we needed to become better store managers, to fix some of the basics in our stores. We spent the last several months focusing on core fundamentals such as inventory, merchandise returns, shrink, markdowns and wage management. By focusing on these urgent agenda items and using the tailwinds we\u2019ve seen from an improving economy, we drove positive momentum in our business. We achieved what we set out to do in the short-term, but we\u2019re not satisfied and recognize that we have more work to do to accomplish our longer term goals. Before discussing our results, I want to provide more detail on the exciting announcement we made this morning regarding associate pay and store structure. As Doug mentioned, we believe our people make the difference and we\u2019re committed to this philosophy. At Walmart, we already provide an opportunity for jobs to become careers in retail. We want to continue to improve that opportunity and to provide it to more associates. The changes we are making are based on our core principles and will make Walmart a better place to work and shop. First, we believe associates equally value their hourly rate and hours worked. We\u2019re happy to announce improvements to both aspects of associates\u2019 earnings opportunity. Current and future associates will benefit from this initiative, which ensures that Walmart hourly associates earn at least $1.75 above today\u2019s federal minimum wage or $9 per hour in April. And current associates will earn $10 per hour or higher by next February. Additionally, we are piloting a scheduling system that will create stability for associates who want predictable hours and the flexibility for those who prefer to select additional shifts to meet customers\u2019 needs each week. Starting in 2016, we will be one of the first retailers to offer some associates fixed hours each week. Next, we are realigning our store operational structure, adding back department managers to give associates a closer relationship with their supervisors to help improve communication, direction and recognition. And finally, we are making new commitments to train associates. They will engage in interactive learning programs to build skills, demonstrate proficiency and be rewarded for their efforts through pay raises and promotions into areas of greater responsibility. We will also offer opportunities to pursue further education, including a high school diploma or GED program, access to language training, and free or low cost college credits to reduce the time and cost of a college education. I want to say thank you to all our 1.2 million Walmart U.S. associates. Together, we\u2019re a part of something bigger than ourselves and bigger than our company. What we do at Walmart extends beyond our stores to our own communities and across this country. I\u2019m thankful to be a part of this organization. Now, let\u2019s move to this quarter\u2019s performance. Net sales grew $3.1 billion or 4.1% versus last year. For the 13-week period ended January 30, comparable store sales were up 1.5%, which exceeded our guidance. This represents an approximate 100 basis point improvement over Q3 and was largely driven by a 1.4% improvement in traffic. This quarter marks the first positive traffic comp since Q3 of fiscal year 2013, as customers saw increased purchasing power from lower gas prices. We also lapped the SNAP reductions and unfavorable weather seen last year. E-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp performance. During the six week holiday season, we experienced overall comp sales growth. We saw increased traffic to the store, aided by our broadcast and digital Holiday Hub marketing campaign. Strong sales of seasonal merchandise and toys, along with key brands and gifts in apparel and home, offset industry declines in entertainment. Customers also continued to refine how they prepared for the holidays, shopping earlier in November for holiday deals, and looking for last-minute gift ideas all the way through Christmas Eve. We were ready when and where our customers needed us, completing almost 1 billion total transactions over the holiday season, including our largest online day ever on Cyber Monday. Looking across the entire fourth quarter, our growth in comp sales was attributable to several key areas of the business. First, we remained pleased by our apparel and home businesses, which brought value to the customers through strong national brands, consistent quality across price points, and relevant products at the right time of the season. Second, our health and wellness business, including optical, remained strong, with growth in script counts from higher penetration in Medicare and Medicaid plans, branded drug inflation, and a strengthening over-the-counter business. Third, while our grocery performance was assisted primarily by inflation and lapping last year\u2019s SNAP reductions, we also saw progress from urgent agenda items, including a focus on adding days of freshness in produce. We still have a long way to go to improve our fresh business and remain focused on this goal. And finally, we saw strong performance from our Neighborhood Market format. While all formats experienced positive sales comps, our traditional Neighborhood Markets continue to outperform Walmart supercenters and discount stores, providing customers with the products and services they desire at locations that are convenient to them. Our traditional Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately 7.7% comp for the quarter. Yet, while we saw positive momentum in these categories, we remained challenged in others. Specifically, declines in our entertainment business persisted, as we faced industry contraction and deflation across many categories. Lapping last year\u2019s gaming console releases, along with fewer video game titles available for new consoles, and shifts from physical to digital media in movies and books, drove high single-digit negative comps in this area. Additionally, although we launched wireless installment plans in November, we\u2019re still ramping up this service as we reacquaint customers with our ability to serve them in this category. Finally, softness in electronics also impacted our online business particularly in the Ship to Home channel. In e-commerce, we remained thoughtful about growth, striving to produce sustainable results through digital and physical access. Our focus on serving customers led to strong performance in Pick Up Today and Ship from Store capabilities, particularly during the holiday season. However, we recognize the significant opportunity we have to grow this area of our business, as customers continue to reshape their shopping behaviors. Now, for the remainder of our financial results. In the fourth quarter, gross profit rate was relatively flat. Operating expenses increased 5.6%, driven primarily by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year. Additionally, we intensified our focus on improving customer experience in our stores. While these actions increased costs, we believe it was the right decision for the customer. In fact, our Checkout Promise program drove customer experience satisfaction scores to their highest level during the holiday season. Due to the success of this program, we are implementing it more broadly in fiscal 2016. Overall, operating income declined approximately 60 basis points for the quarter. Inventory growth moderated from prior quarters, growing 3.9% and less than the rate of sales in Q4. This growth was primarily related to the significant number of new store openings in the quarter. In fact, we opened 178 stores in this quarter alone, including 10 Supercenters and 168 traditional and small-format Neighborhood Markets. Comp store inventory improved in this quarter, driven by strong a holiday sell-through, and better aligned seasonal markdowns in apparel. Inventory management is a key element to customer experience, and whilst we have room for improvement, we are also making progress to better manage working capital. Now, let me cover our full-year financial performance. For the year, net sales increased 3.1%, or $8.6 billion to $288 billion. Comp sales improved 0.5% for the 52-week period ended January 30, while operating income declined 2.1% to $21.3 billion. Gross profit improved 2.6% for the year, with a 12 basis point decline in gross profit rate. This was primarily driven by price investments in meat and preferred Medicare prescription plans. Expenses were up 4.3%, deleveraging 24 basis points for the year, and driven primarily by increased healthcare costs from higher enrollment rates and medical cost inflation. Expenses were further deleveraged by the initial ramp up of 17 new medical Care Clinics, increased utility expenses from cold weather early in the year, and higher rates throughout the year, and declining rates in recyclable materials, such as cardboard. Recall that we get a financial benefit from recycledmaterials. Moving to real estate, we opened 353 net new stores, including relocations and expansions, and added almost 21 million retail square feet. A year ago we started to accelerate our Neighborhood Market format. This fiscal year, we opened 165 traditional format Neighborhood Markets and 68 smaller Neighborhood Markets. By continuing to drive this format, we are able to offer customers easy and convenient access to fresh foods, pharmacy, and services at Walmart\u2019s everyday low price guarantee. Supercenters remain the driver of our sales and growth in retail square footage. Customers continue to rely heavily on this format for their broader shopping needs. This year, we opened an additional 119 supercenters, including conversions and relocations. In FY16, we expect to open approximately 60 to 70 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we\u2019ll open an estimated 180 to 200 Neighborhood Markets, including 10 to 15 smaller-format locations, as we complete our openings of this test program. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the progress of these test locations before making any further commitments to this format. We expect to add approximately 15 to 16 million retail square feet this year. Digital access is important to our customers now more than ever. They expect a seamless interaction, whether it\u2019s in the store or online. We see many opportunities at Walmart to evolve with the customer in their digital and physical experiences. For example, this year we developed a collaborative approach to the holiday season in toys with our store and walmart.com teams working closely together to ensure our customers had the same experience with Walmart no matter where or when they shopped. We\u2019ve been investing in expanding capabilities to allow customers to shop on their own terms and are moving sensibly towards this integration of digital and physical. This includes offering customers a variety of ways to interact with our brand, including picking up their walmart.com orders at their local store, providing reminders and refill capabilities through our pharmacy app, and our latest test concept, Walmart Grocery. This year, we expanded grocery delivery and pickup tests to include the entire Denver market and launched Walmart Grocery Pickup here in Northwest Arkansas this past October. And just last week, we announced the expansion of Walmart Grocery online to select locations in the Phoenix, Arizona, and Huntsville, Alabama markets. We have an advantage at Walmart, by combining our store and distribution network with our e-commerce capabilities to allow customers to interact with our brand in the ways that are most convenient for them, whether it\u2019s in a store, online, or on our mobile app, we are focused on providing the best solutions for customers. The upcoming fiscal year will be a time of change and further improvement to the business. Our focus on inventory management, instock levels, and customer service is just the beginning. Recently, we made changes within our management team. These changes have allowed me to get closer to our merchandising teams, and the new leadership brings with them fresh ideas and an invigorating spirit. We\u2019ve also just wrapped up our year-beginning meeting, which is a time to gather our store managers, to thank them for their hard work in the prior year and to discuss the focus areas for the upcoming year. The meeting was energizing, and our store managers left excited for a fresh start to become better store managers, focusing on item merchandising, and providing great service to the customer. We\u2019ll continue on the path towards hiring 100,000 veterans by 2018. We set this goal just under two years ago and we are proud to say that we\u2019ve already hired almost 80,000 veterans through this program. Furthermore, over 6,000 have been promoted to roles of greater responsibility since joining the Walmart team. But fiscal 2016 will not be without its challenges. Our bottom line will continue to be pressured primarily from the significant investments in associates that I covered earlier. In addition, we will see impact from the changing mix within merchandise categories, store formats, and retail channels, and the investments in digital and physical integration. While we expect to offset some of these headwinds by executing and delivering on our urgent agenda items and other initiatives, we know these investments are necessary to position ourselves to meet the rapidly changing needs of the customer. We may see risk to import merchandise flows related to the upcoming spring and Easter seasons due to ongoing port congestion. We\u2019ll continue to take the appropriate steps using our diversified supply chain network to reduce the impact for our customers. In the first quarter, we expect a continuation of lower gas prices to provide a tailwind to our business. This could be somewhat offset by a shorter selling season, with Easter coming earlier than last year, as well as potential impact from port congestion. For the 13-week period ending May 1, we anticipate a comp sales increase of 1% to 2%. Last year\u2019s 13-week comp ended May 2, 2014 was down 8 basis points. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave? David Cheesewright : Thank you, Greg. I\u2019m pleased with our performance in International, as we\u2019ve remained committed to the strategic priorities I outlined a year ago. We\u2019ve been able to produce solid results and operating income growth, despite operating in a very challenging, competitive retail environment. As one of our key priorities, we continue to accelerate our eCommerce business by offering multiple ways for our customers to shop, whether in stores, online, pickup or mobile, we aim to give our customers the ability to shop in whichever way they want. We\u2019ve also made progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China, and have experienced success in improving our overall price perception, as well as the quality of our fresh offering. We also continue to make progress on our commitment of actively managing our existing portfolio. You\u2019ve seen us make strategic decisions such as closing underperforming stores and divesting non-core parts of our business in order to strengthen our foundation. Our markets remain focused on key strategic priorities, and I\u2019m optimistic about our position going into the New Year. Now for our financial results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis. However, with the U.S. dollar at historic highs, we faced significant currency headwinds of $2.6 billion, resulting in a 3.9% sales decline on a reported basis. Of our five largest countries, Mexico, Canada, and Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. Comps declined in both the UK and China due primarily to food deflation and intense competition in the UK, and government austerity measures and deflation in key categories in China. Comp sales growth was strong in all other markets as well. As Claire mentioned, there were certain discrete items disclosed in the previous year, which have a significant impact on our year-over-year operating income comparison. For financial year ending 2015, our fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by Japan store closure costs of $148 million. Overall, operating income increased 79.6% on a constant currency basis and 66.4% on a reported basis. Excluding the previous and current years discrete items, we grew operating income on a constant currency basis by 14.2%. For the full year, sales grew 3.6% on a constant currency basis, while the strong U.S. dollar resulted in a full-year sales decline of 0.3% on a reported basis, reflecting over a $5 billion currency impact. Full-year operating income grew 24.1% on a constant currency basis and 19.8% on a reported basis. Excluding the items mentioned above, operating income grew 9.3% on a constant currency basis, outpacing full-year sales growth. We made progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter and dropped the growth rate over 250 basis points versus the previous quarter to a 4.6% growth on a constant currency basis. We had positive momentum on inventory management heading into the New Year. Now, let\u2019s discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of ecommerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details. The UK market remained very competitive during the quarter with grocery inflation falling to a record low of negative 0.9% over the 12 weeks ended January 4, according to Kantar. Total market growth of 0.6% was a slight improvement over the previous quarter, boosted by Christmas sales and increased discretionary spending from lower fuel prices. However, overall market trends remain relatively weak. According to Kantar, Asda, along with the other big grocers, lost share to hard discounters for the quarter. UK sales declined 1.7% and comp sales declined 2.5%, excluding fuel. Several competitors held a Black Friday event for the first time and others continued intense vouchering, which led to increased competition versus a year ago. Asda online sales remained strong, while George Home continued to register double-digit growth. Despite the top line pressures, Asda was able to grow income ahead of sales. Now turning to Canada, which had a very solid fourth quarter performance. Sales grew 4.1%, with comp sales increasing 1.8%, marking this the third consecutive quarter of positive comps. Price investments and increased consumer spending contributed to improved trends in sales. We reported strong comp sales in food, health and wellness and consumables. While general merchandise and apparel sales improved versus prior quarter results, they were still below the rate of growth in the market. Our fresh business also continues to accelerate, resulting in the highest comp sales for the year in quarter four. Canada had a strong holiday season overall with the online business up 38.5%. Walmart Canada grew 43 basis points of market share in food, consumables, and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ending January 24. Canada completed a restructuring in the quarter to simplify home office operations. This, along with continued investments in ecommerce and pricing resulted in a decline in operating income. Overall, we are pleased with the positive sales trend we\u2019ve seen in our Canadian operations, and we expect the momentum to continue. Next we\u2019ll discuss Walmex, which released their quarterly results on February 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP; thus some numbers will differ. Consolidated Walmex sales grew 3.4%, with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex leveraged expenses for the quarter and grew operating income faster than sales. Mexico sales increased 3%, and the comp sales were up 0.1% for the quarter. According to ANTAD, the entire market experienced slower comp growth in the fourth quarter of 0.7% in self-service. Walmart Mexico comps, excluding Sam\u2019s Club exceeded the market by 80 basis points. Performance was especially strong in our small format, Bodega Aurrera Express, which outperformed the market by 750 basis points. Sam\u2019s Club growth lagged the market by approximately 330 basis points. However, we are encouraged by the improving top line trends at Sam\u2019s, as December comp sales were the strongest of the year. Sam\u2019s Club remains a focus area and we will continue to accelerate initiatives to improve the business. Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil. Brazil continued sales momentum in Q4, growing net sales and comp sales by 3.1%. Holiday sales were driven by strong performances in both food and consumables. Strategic and targeted pricing resulted in margin favorability for the quarter. Management also continued to drive labor productivity and control expenses. While we are seeing some positive results, there is still work to be done in our turnaround plan. Moving to China. Ongoing headwinds from government austerity measures, reduction in gift card sales, and continued deflation in key categories continue to pose challenges in the market. Walmart China\u2019s Q4 net sales declined 0.7% and comp sales declined 2.3%, partially due to Chinese New Year falling nearly three weeks later than last year. We increased market share in the hypermarket category for the eighth consecutive quarter according to Nielsen for the period ended December 31. We expect market headwinds to continue in the New Year, but we are confident that we will continue to accelerate growth in this important Over the year, China has made great progress in strengthening the core business. Our portfolio is now more focused and stronger with the opening of 24 new hypermarket stores and one additional Sam\u2019s Club, in addition to completing the store closure program announced last year. The distribution center expansion project and the centralization of deliveries to DCs were finalized within the quarter, resulting in a distribution network for fresh that provides coverage for all of our stores in China for the first time. These initiatives drive efficiency, reduce costs, and shorten the lead time to get products on the shelf. Having control over our own distribution network allows us to better monitor the quality and the safety of our products. Additionally, the We Operate for Less and the We Buy for Less programs in China have saved over $150 million over the course of the year. Finally, let\u2019s discuss ecommerce performance across the globe. We remain focused on innovating and providing solutions for our customers seeking convenience. This quarter we\u2019ve made even more progress, and I\u2019m very excited about the impact we\u2019ve made in online retail. In Japan, we automated the order picking process to fulfill Seiyu.com grocery orders more efficiently and sustainably. We\u2019re testing new offerings, such as Grab \u2018N Go lockers in Canada. In India, we are continuing the rollout of an online offering to business-to-business members and expect to reach all members by the end of next year. Yihaodian, our ecommerce business in China benefited from investments in the supply chain and promotional events. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. The fourth quarter was highlighted by a successful Singles Day promotion in November, generating strong sales and traffic growth aided by an increase in orders from mobile devices. In Brazil, ecommerce sales growth was strong again this quarter, driven by strong sales in large appliances and wireless, where low cost smartphones helped drive sales growth of more than double the same period last year. Promotions fueled sales growth with the Black Friday and 72-hour events delivering strong comp sales. Traffic via our mobile app nearly tripled on Black Friday. Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate and execute our strategic plan. I\u2019m amazed by how similar our customers\u2019 needs are around the world, value, assortment, and convenience are paramount. We will remain focused on saving our customers money by expanding our private label offering, improving product sourcing, and driving cost out of our operations, so that we can invest it back into price. We know convenience means different things to customers at different times. It could mean shopping online, home grocery delivery, a one-stop shop experience or a drive-through pickup, and we are innovating to provide customers more shopping options than ever. No matter the shopper preference, Walmart will continue to strive to be the destination of choice. Our objectives for this year will continue to build upon a foundation that\u2019s been established. In financial year ending 2016, we are committed to; actively managing the existing portfolio, driving comp sales, accelerating ecommerce, delivering market priorities, including establishing a platform for sustainable growth in China, moving forward with the turnaround efforts in Brazil and reenergizing the business in Mexico, and lastly strengthening enablers, which means being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. Let me close by thanking our nearly 800,000 international associates around the world for delivering a strong performance in financial year ending 2015. As I reflect on the past year, I\u2019m humbled by what our team has accomplished and their relentless focus on saving customers money. I look forward to updating you on our results in the coming months. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks, Dave. I would like to start by echoing our excitement at Sam\u2019s Club, regarding the company\u2019s announcement today, to boost the starting wage for our full-time and part-time hourly associates. We believe we provide our associates with an excellent opportunity to pursue careers in retail, because our business model at Sam\u2019s Club differs from Walmart stores, beginning in the first-half of the fiscal year, we will offer a starting hourly wage of $9.50, which is above the federal minimum wage, unless there is a higher state-mandated minimum wage. This will ensure all Sam\u2019s Club hourly associates are paid above the federal minimum wage. We believe this investment in our associates will help us attract, retain, and develop top-notch talent, and will allow us to continue to deliver outstanding, award-winning service to our members. Now on to Q4. I want to thank our Sam\u2019s Club associates for delivering the best performance of the year this quarter, providing momentum going into fiscal 2016. Over the last four quarters, we saw meaningful acceleration culminating in a comp sales increase without fuel of 2% for the 13-week period ended January 30. Strong holiday execution combined with our strategic investments in member value, merchandise relevance, and the integration of digital and physical, boosted our performance. Our investments in membership value initiatives enabled us to grow membership income by over 8% this quarter. Our Plus penetration is at historic highs, as Plus members are seeing the benefits from our Cash Rewards program. Across the club, all members are seeing the benefits of Instant Savings and the 5/3/1 MasterCard. We will anniversary the introduction of Plus Cash Rewards and the 5/3/1 MasterCard in June 2015, so we expect these programs to continue driving membership income moving forward. Sam\u2019s net sales, including fuel were $14.9 billion, up 1.3% over last year. This was impacted by the approximately 25% decline in fuel prices with gallons sold up approximately 8%. Our gross profit rate increased 23 basis points due to higher margin on fuel. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 50 basis points. Operating income increased 29.1% to $510 million, which includes $41 million increase in fuel profit. Our 500-plus fuel stations provided value to members through competitive pricing, and the 5/3/1 MasterCard holders benefit from an additional 5% off all gas purchases. Given the volatility in fuel prices, the remainder of this discussion will exclude fuel. Additionally, for comparisons, please recall that last year we had certain items impacting our results, which included; a $39 million charge to gross profit due to an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities, a $59 million charge to operating expenses for a new in-club staffing restructuring and the closure of one club, a $24 million gain in other income for the sale of two real estate properties. In Q4, net sales grew 3.7% and we delivered comp sales of 2%, driven by traffic growth of 1.5% and ticket of 0.5%. The Savings Member continues to drive traffic. We have lapped last year\u2019s SNAP reductions and benefitted from favorable weather this quarter. Retail inflation across the club has moderated slightly since the previous quarter. Our gross profit declined 32 basis points versus last year due to the planned impact of Plus Cash Rewards and pressure from merchandise mix, which were offset by last year\u2019s product warranty charge. Without the comparative benefit of the product warranty charge last year, gross profit declined 61 basis points. As discussed previously, the rollout of Plus Cash Rewards will pressure gross profit in the first-half of fiscal year 2016. Operating expenses were well managed in the quarter and we leveraged 82 basis points. Even without the comparative benefit of last year\u2019s discrete items, we leveraged expenses. We had disciplined expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the club staffing model earlier this year. Membership and other income grew by 1.4% compared to last year, which factors in the real estate gain. Without the $24 million real estate gain last year, membership and other income was up 8.7%. Operating income was up 19.4% to $456 million. Without the comparative benefit of last year\u2019s items, our operating income was flat to last year. We are still very happy with our overall performance for the quarter, given the significant investments in membership value initiatives, such as Plus Cash Rewards. And with good expense management and improvements in membership income, we believe we have great momentum for fiscal 2016. I also want to highlight the team\u2019s efforts around working capital. We reduced total inventory by 3.5%, while simultaneously growing our fleet by 16 clubs during the year. Moreover, I\u2019m confident in the quality of our inventory for this year. At Sam\u2019s Club, relevant merchandise is a critical component in member engagement, and we continue to improve performance across the box. Our merchants are pushing hard to introduce newness and capture consumer trends, while providing the price leadership and assortment that Sam\u2019s Club is known for. Sales of our fresh food business grew positive low single-digits this quarter. Performance was led by meat due to inflation and a strong value proposition. A challenged area was produce, where weather created supply issues. Dry grocery and beverage delivered a positive low single-digit comp with highlights in newness and healthy-for-you items. We doubled the organic portfolio since the previous quarter and members are responding positively to new, healthy beverage options. Let\u2019s continue with health and wellness, which posted a positive mid-single-digit comp. Sam\u2019s Club is a destination for our members\u2019 healthcare needs and we see that clearly in our pharmacy comps, which drove the category due to both script growth and branded prescription inflation. Our OTC business, especially our healthy assortment of nutrition bars and protein also did well. We\u2019ve seen an uptick in our consumables business, which posted a positive low single digit comp. This is an area where members consistently see value through our private brand offerings, improved pack sizes, and Instant Savings. For example, members love the quality of our private brand Member\u2019s Mark Paper products. The disposable tabletop category continues to perform well, and we have introduced newness to improve the laundry and home care business. Home and apparel delivered a positive low single-digit comp. Our exciting assortment of toys was a highlight, drawing members into the club over the holidays. Apparel continues to show strength, driven by menswear and children\u2019s clothing. Our underperforming category continues to be technology and entertainment, which posted a negative mid-single-digit comp. This is an improvement versus last quarter, as a result of introducing the latest Ultra Hi-Def and 4K TV technologies, a strong value proposition on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and an expanded wearables assortment. However, we need to make larger, faster strides. This year, our merchants are rebalancing the portfolio, which involves reallocating resources towards higher growth, higher excitement categories. Ancillary improved to a positive low single-digit comp, driven by growth in tobacco. We saw improved convenience store traffic trends, as we executed strategic pricing initiatives and benefitted from shifts in the competitive landscape. Moving to e-commerce, this quarter, SamsClub.com was integral in supporting our in-club holiday events, becoming a Cyber Week destination and offering online-only promotions that drew members from our physical clubs to our digital platforms. Dot-com delivered double-digit comps in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, contributing approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp. We\u2019ve rebranded Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull to Club Pickup and enhanced the service to appeal to both Savings and Business members. Members have responded well to the re-launch of Club Pickup in all clubs, and we\u2019ve seen accelerated performance compared to the previous quarter. The improvements we\u2019ve made to our mobile and desktop platforms, along with enhancements in messaging, have boosted conversion rates across all platforms. This concludes our discussion on fourth quarter results. Let\u2019s continue with the financial results for the full year, where we\u2019ve seen meaningful, sustainable acceleration every quarter. With fuel, net sales were $58 billion, up 1.5% over last year. With fuel profit of $122 million, operating income for the year grew 7.2% to $2 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $51.6 billion, up 2.1%. For the 52-week period ending January 30, 2015, comp sales increased 50 basis points, driven by traffic. While our investments in Cash Rewards for Plus members led to a gross profit rate decline of 38 basis points, we managed expenses well and leveraged 24 basis points. Membership income increased 10.3%, driving operating income of $1.9 billion, a 2% increase over last year. Fiscal 2016 is well under way and Sam\u2019s Club is innovating the member experience through merchandise relevance and digital/physical integration. These two priorities are the key to membership engagement. I am confident that our strategic investments will not only differentiate us from our competitors, but, more importantly, continue enhancing our members\u2019 trust and loyalty. Merchandise relevance is a critical enabler. Our goal is to ensure that members are surprised and delighted by relevant merchandise every time they come into the club or visit our website in every category across the country. Combined with price leadership and newness, merchandise relevance will keep our members coming back for more. Our Fiscal 2016 investment strategy reflects the importance of offering a seamless digital/physical club experience for members. I recently was at the grand opening of our new e-commerce facility in San Bruno, California where Jamie Iannone, who leads SamsClub.com, has invested in expanding his team of engineers and scientists. I am optimistic about our growth opportunities in both the digital and the physical. And that\u2019s why we plan to open 9 to 12 new and relocated clubs, and remodel between 55 and 60 clubs this year, while simultaneously investing in innovation at SamsClub.com. Knowing that our most engaged members want to shop with us both in our clubs and online, we will ensure a seamless set of access points for members. I am proud of how we finished out the year. For the 13- week period from January 31 through May 1, we expect comp sales to increase between 1% and 2%. Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Neil for the e-commerce update. Neil? Neil Ashe : Thanks, Roz. Q4 was an important quarter for us, not just because it is the biggest quarter of the fiscal year, but because our key investments started to play a major role in the business. Most notably, our global technology platform Pangaea, and our U.S. fulfillment network stood up under the holiday volumes of U.S. customers. At the same time, we saw good sales in markets around the world. For the full year and for Q4, we outgrew the e-commerce market globally. Overall, Walmart grew e-commerce sales by 22%, benefitted by a 25% increase in gross merchandise value, or GMV for the year. In Q4, we grew sales 18%, on GMV growth of 20%. An increase in third-party marketplace volumes in the U.S., Brazil and in China contributed to the growth in GMV. Greg, Dave, and Roz talked about the e-commerce successes in the quarter, but it\u2019s worth recapping. In the U.S., we had record sales on Cyber Monday and Cyber Week and more than 1.5 billion page views over the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. Samsclub.com had strong double-digit comps on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday. On Singles Day in China on November 11, Yihaodian\u2019s GMV growth was in the high double digits, and on December 21, we surpassed traffic from Singles Day. In the UK, ASDA continued to make Click and Collect easier for customers in stores and with new pick up points at petrol stations, tube stations and other locations. We now have Click and Collect in all ASDA stores. In Brazil, we saw our strongest sales quarter, with high double-digit sales growth. What excites me most is the progress we\u2019ve made in building out our ability to serve customers across digital and physical. We\u2019re investing in four areas; our global technology platform, our next generation fulfillment network, our talent, and on integrating digital and physical. Starting with our global technology platform, I refer to this as the operating system for commerce, because it is the foundation for serving customers digitally, enables the integration of digital and physical commerce. Building and deploying a new platform is one of the most challenging projects for an e-commerce business, particularly at our scale. We launched most key elements of our site and mobile shopping experience on the new platform before holiday on walmart.com in the U.S. Despite all of our testing, with the sheer complexity of a complete platform rebuild, there is nothing like the real thing on the busiest day of the year, Cyber Monday. Pangaea hummed along all day, serving our customers at record volume. While we were glued our screens watching performance, a mom in Dallas was glued to her screen on walmart.com crossing items off of her holiday shopping list. She was most likely shopping on a tablet, and she was browsing pages about 30% faster, thanks to Pangaea. She was seeing a personalized shopping experience with a lot more recommendations for items that her kids might like. Hers was among a record number of orders. It was the first major test of our next generation fulfillment network, which combined our first large scale center in Texas with our existing fulfillment centers, distribution centers and stores, to ship a record number of walmart.com orders. Our team in Texas shipped twice as many orders as last year. She was able to get more things from us even faster. Starting in the second quarter, we have four more of these large-scale fulfillment centers coming online. While there will be some ramp-up time, they will significantly expand our fulfillment capacity and efficiency in the coming years. We\u2019ve talked about the importance of investing in talent and the fact that we are building a technology company inside the world\u2019s largest retailer. In the past year, we have been able to build up our team to the critical mass needed to be that technology company. And we did it in a very selective way, bringing in some of the best talent in Silicon Valley through organic hiring and targeted acquisitions. We also built a great team in Silicon Valley to serve Sam\u2019s Club across digital and physical. We\u2019ll be continuing to hire the best people, adding to the core team we\u2019ve built to deliver on our priorities. When we were together at the analyst meeting in October, I talked through the story of a family in Denver who can rely on Walmart to make their lives easier by being everywhere they need us to be. Echoing Greg, I\u2019m really proud of how we brought together the digital and physical customer experience during the holidays. In the U.S., we created a series of moments that engaged customers with us both online and in stores, starting with online deals Thanksgiving morning, leading to the Black Friday store events and through the new evening edition on Cyber Monday for people who worked during the day. Mobile continued to be a big investment and area of high growth, nearly 70% of our walmart.com traffic during the holidays was from mobile devices. Those people used the app in a lot of ways to do their shopping online, to find a store, or to use the new store search tool we added late last year. This search tool allows customers to find product details and the aisle location of a specific item. Sam\u2019s also offered a significantly enhanced shopping experience through its app and mobile web site. In addition to Walmart, we\u2019ve focused on Sam\u2019s digital and physical integration with its Club Pickup experience, and it paid off, as we saw nearly 30% growth in Club Pickup during holiday. We\u2019re also continuing to create a stronger relationship with new and existing customers with grocery pickup and delivery. We\u2019ve continued to see great feedback from customers on our tests in San Jose and Denver, and last week we started serving customers in Phoenix, Arizona and Huntsville, Alabama. To sum up, last year was a building year and that will continue this year. We ended up investing an incremental $0.08 per share during fiscal year 2015, which was over our forecast of $0.05 to $0.07, as we continued to invest in fulfillment and other areas to serve our customers. As I mentioned, we saw global sales grow by 22%, benefitted by a 25% increase in GMV for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2016 will continue to be a building year, and we expect sales to grow worldwide in the mid-20s. In fiscal year 2016, we expect to invest incrementally between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for e-commerce initiatives. Our investments will continue to significantly enhance the customer experience and drive greater efficiency. This will include the continued rollout of our U.S. site based on Pangaea, which will make checkout faster and easier for our customers. It is also serving as the backbone to an integrated experience across online, stores and mobile. It will empower new ways to serve customers through mobile. That platform will also allow us to further expand our online assortment. We\u2019ll do that though a thoughtful balance of our own merchandise and marketplace sellers. We expect to double our assortment this year to well over 10 million SKUs. We\u2019ll also continue fulfilling our promise to deliver orders to customers when and where they want them. Our next generation fulfillment network combines new large-scale fulfillment centers that combined with our DCs and stores, all connected by Walmart\u2019s transportation network. Our data scientists have built algorithms that dictate the assortment that needs to be placed in our different nodes, and to dictate from which node we ship an order. Four new fulfillment centers will come online starting in the second quarter. When fully operational, these centers along with our other nodes will position us to serve the vast majority of the U.S. population fast and at a low cost. We\u2019re working closely with Greg\u2019s team to deliver a seamless experience for customers who use our stores to pick up or return orders. And, we\u2019re working with Roz\u2019s team to continue enhancing Sam\u2019s Club Pickup and making reordering fast and simple. Sam\u2019s will also make signing up easier and make membership even more valuable with services and by helping members discover new products. Sam\u2019s will have the ability to leverage Walmart\u2019s investment in e-commerce. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to invest in the major markets for ecommerce, most notably Brazil, China and the UK. And, we\u2019ll continue to expand our relationship with customers through online grocery pickup and delivery. All of these achievements from this quarter significantly improved our ability to serve customers however they want to shop with us. And many of our investments from last year will roll out this year. We have significant opportunities ahead, and I feel great about the progress we\u2019ve made on our priorities, including our global technology platform, talent, next generation fulfillment network and the integration of digital and physical. We are delivering Walmart where you are, whether you shop online, through mobile or in stores. No matter how you shop, we\u2019re helping you save money and live better. Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Charles. Charles? Charles Holley : Thanks, Neil. I\u2019ll wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on the company\u2019s performance. For the year, we delivered $486 billion in revenue. E-commerce sales grew approximately 22% to more than $12 billion. We delivered fourth quarter underlying earnings per share of $1.61 and reported earnings per share of $1.53. Recall that our underlying earnings per share reflects the performance of our business without the impact of discrete items. Now, as a reminder, our fourth quarter guidance of $1.46 to $1.56 included the discrete item of the Japan restructure, which was approximately $0.03 per share. Walmart U.S. generated a very solid 1.5% comp in the fourth quarter. Although the strong U.S. dollar caused a negative impact of over $5 billion on revenue, Walmart International delivered very good sales growth of nearly 4% on a constant currency basis for the year. And, Sam\u2019s Club continued to drive membership income again this year, with growth of over 10%. Now, on the other hand, as I just mentioned, currency negatively impacted revenue by more than $5 billion. Although not as high as we anticipated, healthcare expenses were a headwind for Walmart U.S. during the year. And our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by $0.08, due to the discrete items that Claire mentioned earlier. Before turning our attention to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal year 2016, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the future is based on the enterprise strategy we discussed at our October investor conference. Our clear focus on driving sales through price, assortment, access and experience will continue to guide the investments we make to better serve our customers. Our guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and currency exchange rates remaining at current levels. In October, we forecasted a 2% to 4% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. However, as a result of where currency rates are today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $10 billion on net sales. Our new forecast for fiscal year 2016 net sales growth is between 1% and 2%. Our capital expenditure guidance of $11.6 billion to $12.9 billion, and our total net retail square footage growth of 26 million to 30 million square feet remain unchanged. Also in October, we shared that our capital expenditure range reflects that we will grow through a smaller number of large supercenters in the U.S. And as previously announced we are dedicating capital related to our digital and e-commerce businesses of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. In fiscal 2016, we expect our FCPA-related expenses to range between $160 million and $180 million. Recall that these are included in our corporate and support expenses. Our incremental investment in our Global eCommerce business in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.08 per share, above the $0.05 to $0.07 per share we shared with you in November. We plan to step up our incremental investment again in fiscal 2016 for our e-commerce activities around the world. This investment is expected to range between $0.06 and $0.09 per share over fiscal 2015. As I indicated at the October investor conference, the heaviest investment in e-commerce will come over the next 18 to 24 months, as we further integrate the shopping experience, appealing to our customer\u2019s desire for convenience, access, and assortment. We then expect to see operating losses start to moderate at the end of that period. We continue to seek the right balance between sales growth and profitability for ecommerce. Doug shared the news about our people initiatives within our U.S. businesses, including a wage restructuring and training opportunities to help associates earn higher pay and advance their careers. These strategic investments, which will cost approximately $1 billion this year, are designed to ultimately benefit our customers and our businesses through a better store and club experience. However, they will impact our earnings per share this fiscal year. In the first quarter, we expect these investments to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The full year earnings per share impact is expected to be approximately $0.20. In addition to the impact from these two significant investments, operating income, like sales, will also be pressured by currency exchange rates. Our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2016 estimated tax rate ranging between 32% and 34%. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. As we have seen in the past, we expect our first quarter tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be the highest of the four quarters. Taking all of this into account, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.10. This compares to $1.10 last year. We expect full year earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. This compares to reported earnings per share of $4.99 in fiscal 2015, which included the discrete items we\u2019ve discussed. Now, before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.92 to $1.96 per share for fiscal 2016, to be paid out quarterly. We\u2019ve now increased our dividend each year for 42 years. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchase. Market conditions, general business trends, operating results, and a goal of maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. Working capital management remains a very high priority for us, and although we have made some improvements in fiscal 2015, we acknowledge we have more work to do. Our leadership teams are very committed to further improvement in fiscal year 2016. Throughout Walmart, we remain focused on being disciplined in delivering for our associates, our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your continued interest in our company.

Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off the call. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. Overall, we had a solid first quarter. Walmart generated nearly $115 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share within our guidance range at $1.03. I\u2019ll cover the results for the quarter in just a minute, but I\u2019d like to start with an update on some of our larger strategic choices and the progress we\u2019ve made to bring them to life. Our objective is to make changes to improve our short to mid-term performance while, at the same time, position the company for the long-term. By position, I\u2019m referring to how we set ourselves up to serve customers for years to come and the strategic choices we\u2019re making are in two critical areas, people and technology. In April, we launched a comprehensive set of store and club initiatives that I discussed in last quarter\u2019s call. These are intended to improve our short to mid-term performance in the United States. As you\u2019ll remember, we\u2019re investing in our starting wage rates, an improved store structure, including adding department managers, and wage increases for most positions within our stores and clubs in the U.S. We have pilots under way that will improve our scheduling process and improve our training. This set of initiatives is designed to improve the customer experience and translate into higher comp store sales over time. The rollout of these changes happens throughout this year. We know that we won\u2019t see it overnight, but we\u2019re confident these are the right things to do for our business and our team. I\u2019ve recently visited stores and clubs in the Detroit and Seattle markets and I\u2019m encouraged with our associates\u2019 level of ownership in the business and understanding of the plan. As we improve the experience in our stores, we continue to invest to deliver a stronger mobile and e-commerce experience. In U.S. we\u2019re rolling out a more simplified checkout process on walmart.com, which is based on our global technology platform, Pangaea. An important part of this platform is that it delivers a better experience on mobile devices. Mobile is increasingly the driver of our e-commerce business. A few weeks ago, I visited stores and clubs in Beijing and Shanghai. I really enjoyed listening to our Yihaodian customer focus group and following one of our associates around as we delivered orders to apartments in Shanghai. There are new, exciting developments happening in retail and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re in the thick of it. But, I was also reminded that the same basic tenets of our business, like value for money, a great assortment and customer service, are what they\u2019re after. Those customers we delivered to in Shanghai were quick to praise our associate in his service during deliveries. They liked our prices, but asked for items that we don\u2019t yet carry. I was pleased to hear from them that we didn\u2019t need to open the cases of merchandise because they trusted our delivery associate. That\u2019s a big deal. The week before being in China, I walked stores in Mexico and saw a growing business in grocery home shopping there, too. The associates I visited with in Mexico were sensing a momentum in their business and it was good to see them leaning forward. So, we\u2019ll make these investments in our people, we\u2019ll give them the opportunity to move up so that they\u2019re engaged in our business and happy to serve customers. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue making progress with digital, mobile and e-commerce. And, we\u2019ll bring it all together in a seamless way that delivers value for customers. We\u2019re moving on a lot of fronts and picking up some speed. Around the world, our associates are focused on running great stores, empowering their teams, developing technological solutions to solve customer problems and integrating it all together. Now, let\u2019s get into our first quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. again delivered positive comp sales, and I\u2019m encouraged by the customer traffic trends. I\u2019m particularly pleased by the customer response to our Neighborhood Markets, driving strong comps again this quarter. Based on recent surveys, we know that many of our U.S. customers are using their tax refunds and the extra money from lower gas prices to pay down debt or put it into savings. They\u2019re also using these funds for everyday expenses like utilities and groceries. That\u2019s where we can be their destination of choice. We\u2019re not where we want to be in every store, but I\u2019m pleased with the progress that I\u2019m seeing. Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales growth this quarter. Mexico and Canada had really good sales results. In Mexico, the Sam\u2019s Club business is where we\u2019ve seen our most dramatic improvement, due to improved merchandise and stronger in-club operations. And one of the more encouraging signs for me is that this execution is happening over multiple store formats in Mexico, including Bodega. In China, we\u2019re doing a better job of managing inventory and building customers\u2019 trust with the quality of our fresh offering. Sam\u2019s Club had lower comp sales and profit than expected. Membership income was up more than 7%, indicating the emphasis on winning over more members to Plus status is progressing. Sam\u2019s recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention, and investments in Club Pick-up and e-commerce are starting to pay off. However, we need more consistent progress, and I\u2019m confident that the strategic plan the Sam\u2019s Club team is working on will lead to longer-term improvements in our club business. We\u2019re investing to win the future of retail, and I\u2019m excited about the possibilities that our improved e-commerce capabilities will provide. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re making progress on rolling out our global technology platform to make e-commerce and mobile shopping easier for customers. Walmart\u2019s worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 17% in the first quarter. Asda\u2019s this grocery home shopping continues to drive double-digit growth, and we\u2019re sharing this expertise around the world to test delivery and pickup services in more locations. To meet our growth projections, we recently announced a new fulfillment center in Brazil, which will be our second one there dedicated solely to e-commerce. We will open two new mechanized fulfillment centers this quarter in the U.S. and two others will follow later this year. At Walmart, we operate our business in a way that adds value to communities. We recently published our annual Global Responsibility Report. I\u2019d love for you to take a look at our ongoing initiatives to create economic opportunity for our associates and others in the retail industry; to enhance the sustainability of our operations and product supply chain; and to strengthen communities in the places where we operate. It\u2019s real and meaningful work, and something we\u2019re really proud of. On Friday, June 5th, we\u2019ll hold our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. It\u2019s always a great opportunity to hear from our shareholders and interact with so many of our more than 5,000 associates who come from our markets around the world. I always leave this meeting energized after spending time with our associates. Looking ahead, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making and the plans in place for the future. Our priority is to drive growth across the enterprise. Globally, we\u2019re working to exceed customer expectations by helping them save time and money and have a great experience as they interact with us in store, online or on their phone. We\u2019ve made progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. We\u2019re pushing to change faster as we continue down the right path to deliver long-term value to both customers and shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire. Claire? Claire Babineaux-Fontenot: Thanks, Doug. Today, I\u2019ll highlight some items in the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript. For the first quarter of fiscal \u201816, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS were $1.03. This compares to last year\u2019s EPS of $1.10, which was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 from severe weather. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a greater than anticipated impact on this year\u2019s first quarter results. Fluctuations in currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3.3 billion, and similarly impacted EPS by $0.03. As a reminder, our incremental investment in e-commerce was approximately $0.02 per share, and the investment in U.S. associates impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. These investments were also the primary contributor to the 2.8% increase in consolidated operating expenses. Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $33 million, comprised of $25 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $53 million in the first quarter. The company\u2019s consolidated operating income decreased 8.3%. Excluding the impact from currency, operating income decreased 6.1%. The company\u2019s continued investments in e-commerce, as well as wages and training for our U.S. associates, were headwinds on our operating income during the quarter. As you will see on slide two, net interest expense increased 45.1%, primarily due to the cumulative impact of an immaterial accounting correction that I will explain in a moment. Without this cumulative adjustment, interest expense would have been flat. We consolidate a number of entities into our financial statements for which there are minority, or non-controlling, interests. In one of these entities in Canada, we determined that certain historical sales of properties did not qualify for sale accounting, due to the company\u2019s continuing involvement in the sold properties. As a result, under U.S. GAAP, these properties should have remained in our financial statement as assets, with a corresponding financial obligation recorded equal to the properties\u2019 sales proceeds. The assets and financial obligation are amortized over time. During the first quarter, we recorded the correction to our balance sheet to increase assets by $1.1 billion and liabilities by $1.4 billion. With respect to the income statement, the correction included $254 million of cumulative interest expense, offset by a related tax benefit of $53 million, and $173 million attributable to non-controlling interest. The correction had a de minimis impact on our operating income and on earnings per share, as EPS is based on income attributable to Walmart. From the balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 2.2%. Later in today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.4%, which compares to 80.2% last year. Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2015 was 16.6%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from continuing operations and impact of timing of payments for inventory, as well as timing of income tax payments. The last item I\u2019ll leave you with today is share repurchases. The company repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $280 million during the quarter. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influenced our share repurchase activity. We have approximately $10 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. Greg? Greg Foran : Thank you, Claire. Back on April the 1st in New York, we provided an update on the Walmart U.S. business. We discussed what was working well, and what needed improvement in order to meet, both the expectations of customers and the goals of the company. We laid out a multi-year plan that includes several large and specific projects, all of which fit within our broader strategic focus on assortment, price, access, and customer experience. As we discussed, we\u2019re not only interested in reaching our goals, but reaching them in a way which is sustainable for the long-term. This requires a steady execution, a pace that is fast but calculated, and one that allows us to get it right. This quarter we began executing this plan. We took the initial steps in April towards a stronger investment in our associates by raising the minimum starting wage for all hourly associates to $9 per hour. As a part of our $1 billion investment in our associates, we also raised the floor and ceiling on pay bands in our stores, creating raises for many full and part-time hourly associates at every level. More than 500,000 associates benefited from this change. We\u2019re also restructuring the management teams in the stores, adding back almost 8,000 department managers. These department managers will have responsibility for a smaller area of the store ensuring that they have the knowledge and the time to engage with both the customers and store associates driving an overall better experience. The $1 billion investment in our associates this year includes training programs as well. Also included in our wage investments we\u2019ve continued our Checkout Promise initiative we began over the holidays ensuring more registers are open during peak times to drive a fast and friendly experience as customers are completing their shopping trips. Finally, we continued to make steady progress against the other initiatives we\u2019ve discussed, including our urgent agenda items, assortment discipline, pricing, and in-stock goals. These actions require a significant investment, which is included in our financial plan for the year. It\u2019s an investment we believe is imperative to providing customers with the unparalleled shopping experience they expect and deserve, and our associates with more opportunities to build a successful career at Walmart. With these steps in mind, let\u2019s move on to our first quarter results. Net sales grew $2.4 billion, or 3.5%, versus last year. For the 13-week period ended May 1st, comparable stores were up 1.1%, which was within our guidance. Comp sales were driven by solid growth in traffic, which was up 1%. Customers continue to see the benefit of lower gas prices versus last year and are responding favorably to some of our new assortments for the spring and summer selling seasons. All formats had positive comps for the quarter, including our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, which posted approximately a 7.9% comp. A focus on customer service and in-stock position drove strong traffic in this format. Customers continue to see the benefit of Neighborhood Markets to meet their everyday needs, including convenient access to services such as drive-through pharmacies and fuel stations. Merchandise comp performance was similar to last quarter. Customers responded to the new spring and summer assortments in apparel and continued growth in active wear and strong brands across the category helped meet customers\u2019 assortment needs. Indoor home categories with key items and investments in opening price points drove momentum. We also saw customers transition outside driving sales in outdoor, lawn and garden, and toys. Last, health and wellness posted strong comp sales with momentum in both OTC and optical driven by recent product launches, as well as continued growth in pharmacy scripts. Within general merchandise, we continued to feel pressure in media and electronics, resulting from industry contraction, the shift from physical to digital media, and lapping last year\u2019s release of the movie Frozen. Additionally, in-stock positions in categories such as TVs suffered as a result of the port congestion on the West Coast. That said we now believe the majority of this disruption is behind us. Moving to grocery, we were pleased by the operational improvement we saw in fresh. As we mentioned in April, this is a key area of focus, and getting fresh right is critical to the customer experience. We\u2019re taking the right steps towards reducing the time to bring fresh product to our customers, and training associates to ensure the best offering is on the shelf. We still have a lot more to do in this area, but we\u2019re steadily improving. One key headwind we faced in grocery during the first quarter was moderating inflation in meat, and deflation in both dairy and produce. While partially offset by inflationary trends in dry and frozen foods, we estimate the moderation in fresh foods impacted our overall comp performance by almost 70 basis points this quarter. Overall, net food inflation negatively impacted our comp by approximately 20 basis points. Finally, e-commerce, driven by strong traffic and price leadership, saw double-digit comp growth across many departments. E-commerce plays a key role in our focus on access for the customer, which is fundamentally around convenience. We\u2019re launching the final phase of our new platform related to cart and online checkout capabilities. Our customers are using their mobile devices to access our site on the go. Mobile traffic was up over 100% for the quarter, and we saw higher conversion rates as well. We continue to learn from our grocery home shopping tests where we recently added another location to the Huntsville, Alabama market. And, we\u2019re working towards a better customer experience in our Walmart Pickup program formerly called Site to Store. The program includes improved email communication, a new signage package that makes it easier for customers to understand the program, and a focus on a faster pickup experience in the stores. It will roll out to all stores by October 1st. For the quarter, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp performance. Moving on to the remainder of our financial results. In the first quarter, gross profit rate declined 13 basis points, driven primarily by a headwind from shrink, half of which was in food. We are addressing this increase immediately, bringing a high level of focus and visibility to this concern by adding it as a key urgent agenda item this year. In addition to shrink, the ongoing mix shift in pharmacy, incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion, and cost inflation in consumables contributed to the decline. Somewhat offsetting this was a continued focus on the urgent agenda items laid out last year, including managing throwaways in fresh and reducing inventory that is no longer active in the stores. As expected, operating expenses increased 6.6% versus last year. This was driven by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year and the investments we\u2019re making in our associates, including the increase in minimum starting pay rates, the restructure of store management roles, and the continuation of our Checkout Promise initiative. Finally, ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology were a headwind to the quarter. Given these investments, along with the reduction in gross profit rate, operating income declined 6.8% or $336 million for the quarter. Inventory grew 5.4% in the first quarter. Almost half of this growth was related to the significant number of new stores added in the past several months. The remainder of the growth was related to congestion clearing in the West Coast ports, and some conscious replenishment decisions we made to drive improvements in our in-stock position. We continue to make strides against our goal of strong working capital management. We grew inventory in comp stores below the rate of sales, and our in-stock position continued to improve throughout the quarter. This quarter, we opened 20 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 15 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, and 9 smaller-format locations, including one campus store location. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the past several months truly understanding what it will take to succeed over time in a rapidly-changing retail environment. This quarter, we made some improvements, taking the right steps at a steady pace, ensuring we stay on track towards the long-term goals of the business. We continue to monitor our fast, friendly, and clean performance in the stores, and based on customer feedback, we are making good progress. I\u2019m out walking our stores every week, visiting our associates and talking to our customers in markets across the country. Additionally, Judith McKenna, our Chief Operating Officer, has visited with over 750 store managers in recent weeks, gathering their thoughts on how we can improve. We are pleased that our customer service scores have steadily increased this quarter with all geographic areas and formats showing positive results. We know, though, that we\u2019re not where we want to be yet. It will take time to achieve our goals, but we\u2019re fully committed to providing our customers with a shopping experience they can love, and associates who see their efforts leading to broader and better careers. For the second quarter, we expect traffic to remain strong supported by sustained low gas prices and our efforts to improve customer service in our stores. This will be offset, in part, by a continued decline in food inflation rates. For the 13-week period ending July 31, we anticipate a comp sales increase of around 1%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were flat. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave? Dave Cheesewright : Thank you, Greg. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to visit the majority of our markets, and I continue to be pleased with the progress I see. Overall, we\u2019ve had a solid start to the fiscal year financially and continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these key priorities include, actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, particularly in China, Brazil and Mexico; and finally, strengthening key enablers such as being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. Before we discuss the financials, here are a few highlights from the first quarter. First, I\u2019m particularly pleased with our overall performance in Mexico, which not only had its strongest net quarterly sales growth in over two years, but also grew operating income faster than sales. Our results in Mexico were due to better comps in all key formats, including Sam\u2019s Club. Also, I want to call out our performance in Canada, which had a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition to Canada and Mexico, we achieved comp growth in most of our other markets, as we remain committed to delivering positive comp sales across the board. I\u2019m energized by the execution I\u2019ve seen from our teams. In addition, I\u2019m excited about our efforts in accelerating e-commerce. In the UK, grocery home shopping continues to report double-digit comps, and we\u2019re leveraging our UK experience in other markets across the globe. Earlier, Doug mentioned some of our change initiatives that we\u2019re working on across the enterprise. One of these initiatives is built around this experience in grocery home shopping. We have a newly created International Acceleration Team based in the UK that is building close partnerships with our markets to speed up the adoption of grocery home shopping processes and technologies. We\u2019re now working towards a common technology platform to better position us for the expansion of grocery home shopping. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our first quarter results. In the first quarter, net sales grew 3.4% on a constant currency basis, partially benefitting by the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter. The U.S. dollar has remained at historically high levels, leading to a considerable currency impact of $3.3 billion, which led to a 6.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were favorable across four of our five top markets, with the UK driven by continued deflation in food and aggressive competition, being the exception. We also had negative comps in Japan, lapping last year\u2019s benefit of accelerated consumer spending ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax hike. We grew comp sales in our remaining markets. As expected, operating income grew slower than sales at 0.1% on a constant currency basis, impacted by planned strategic investments in our e-commerce businesses and ongoing economic and competitive pressures in certain markets. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 8.2%, driven by slower sales in the UK and inventory build-up leading up to the Easter holiday. On a reported basis, inventory declined 5.4%. Now let\u2019s discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and changes in various metrics are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides eight and nine of the presentation summarize financial details. Let\u2019s start with the UK. The market remained highly competitive and promotional. Hard discounters continued to gain share, though at a slowing rate, and all major supermarkets stepped up aggressive investments in price. As a result, grocery deflation persisted at record levels, leading to low market growth. Grocery prices were down 2% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended March 29, according to Kantar. UK sales declined 2.9% and comp sales declined 3.3% excluding fuel, primarily driven by deflation in fresh. Operating income declined, negatively impacted by lower sales and margin. Heading into Q2, the team is focused on improving sales and operating performance through price investments in branded goods, maintaining aggressive price points on key items, and continuing to invest in the highest quality fresh offering. Asda\u2019s five-year strategy of investing \u00a31 billion in lowering prices remains on track this year, our second year of the program. In Canada, we maintained solid growth amid a dynamic, competitive environment. Sales were up 3.7%, and comps were up 1.8%, driven by solid Easter sales, strong performance in seasonal and improving strength in our overall food business, including fresh. We continue to enhance our value and price offering, especially with private brands, where we saw significant growth. Market share increased in food, health and wellness, consumables, and infant categories, for the 12 weeks ended April 18, according to Nielsen. Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. We remain focused on our low cost operating model and continue to seek out opportunities to drive efficiencies to reduce expenses. I\u2019m pleased with performance overall and expect the positive trend to continue, as the competitive landscape evolves. On May the 8th, we announced the acquisition of 13 stores, 12 leased and one owned, and one distribution center from a former competitor. While these transactions are subject to bankruptcy court approval, we look forward to bringing additional supercentres to more provinces in Canada. These stores are in addition to the 29 supercentres we announced as part of our current fiscal year expansion program. Next, let\u2019s turn to Mexico, which released their earnings on April the 21st. Please note that the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Operating income growth was also favorable, up 10.4% year-over-year. Mexico net sales grew 7.1% and comp sales increased 4.9%. Self-service gained 80 basis points of market share during the quarter, according to ANTAD. Performance was strong in food and consumables, the largest contributor to the comp sales momentum. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, benefitted by improved merchandise assortment and initiatives to grow the membership base. I\u2019m excited about the momentum and outlook, as the team continues to launch initiatives and price investments that will resonate with the customer. In addition to top line performance, Mexico did a good job managing expenses, delivering over 30 basis points of leverage compared to last year, driven by lower utility, supplies, and advertising expenses. Now, on to Brazil, market conditions worsened this quarter due to continued inflationary cost pressures. In addition, the retail grocery sector had its worst first quarter growth in the last six years at 2.2%, according to Serasa Experian, a global information services company. Despite the continuing economic slowdown, I was pleased to see another quarter of steady growth in Brazil. Both net sales and comp sales were up 3.0%. Sam\u2019s Club and Maxxi formats outpaced retail market growth, with double-digit comp sales increases. Brazil continues to invest in price, particularly in general merchandise, in an effort to improve sales trends in retail formats. Brazil did not leverage expenses for the quarter, largely due to the inflationary pressures that I\u2019ve just mentioned. Management remains focused on turnaround initiatives to deliver profitability in the back half of the year. Moving on to China, Walmart China\u2019s Q1 net sales grew 1.9% and comp sales grew 0.4%, as sales for Chinese New Year improved year-over-year. Recall that Chinese New Year was January the 31st last year and February the 19th this year, so some sales shifted from Q4 into Q1 this year. According to China UnionPay Data, our gift card loading outperformed the market in the high volume months of January and February. Nielsen also showed that Walmart increased market share in fast moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel, and maintained share in the Modern Trade channel, which includes smaller format stores, for the 12-weeks ended March 29. While there are ongoing market headwinds from government austerity and slightly slower economic growth, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver growth in China. Part of this growth will come from the planned opening of 33 stores and clubs this year, with expansion focused in the southern regions where we have strong market presence. Additionally, we aim to provide better services and widen our customer reach through greater expansion of our omni-channel platforms, including online and mobile. We\u2019re focused on driving efficiency, cost reductions and strengthening our portfolio in China. Operating income grew 23.5%, up due to expense leverage and gross margin improvement from higher sell-through with Chinese New Year. We leveraged expenses this quarter in our core business through \u201cWe Operate for Less\u201d and \u201cWe Buy for Less\u201d initiatives and will continue to pass those savings onto customers. Finally, let\u2019s discuss e-commerce performance. Accelerating e-commerce is one of our strategic objectives this year, and we\u2019re making significant strides in providing convenient access for shoppers as we continue to invest globally in e-commerce capabilities. In Mexico, we\u2019re launching an improved Sam\u2019s Club website in the second quarter and an app in the third quarter. In China, we\u2019ll launch a new app later this quarter for our stores that will enable customers to shop from their local Walmart store and choose to pick up their order in store or have it delivered to home. And in Canada, our e-commerce business continues to perform strongly with a comp of greater than 40%. Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from the Spring Festival promotion to support Chinese New Year, with strong sales of imported items in milk products, shampoo, and other categories. Orders drove most of our growth and our conversion rate improved nearly 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Mobile contributed more than 40% of orders. Brazil e-commerce had another strong performance this quarter, with comps up double digits and outpaced the Brazilian total e-commerce market growth rate. Phones, auto and tires, and baby categories helped drive this growth. Above average summer temperatures drove strong sales in fans and air conditioners. On Consumer Day, a national event in March that\u2019s similar to a Black Friday event in the U.S. we also delivered strong sales growth. In addition to our solid financial performance, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in strengthening our key enablers of being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. One way we deliver on being the lowest cost operator is by reducing our total energy required to power our buildings. For example, in the UK, we\u2019re migrating to a new energy monitoring system that provides daily energy alarms, analytic capabilities and reporting. In addition, we remain committed to programs that develop talent. We began providing retail training to women in emerging markets last year and have now trained women in several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, and India, and are focused on scaling projects throughout this year. By the end of next year, we plan to have trained 200,000 women for their first jobs in retail in our emerging markets. As we look forward to the rest of the year for the International business, we anticipate some headwinds, particularly in Latin America, where in the second quarter we lap last year\u2019s World Cup. We also expect similar trends in the UK to continue given market conditions, and anticipate ongoing currency pressure with the strength of the U.S. dollar. At the same time, though, we have strong momentum in markets like Mexico and Canada, and expect to see solid growth continue in these markets. The global landscape remains challenging and the retail industry is highly competitive. However, I believe we\u2019re headed in the right direction and are making progress towards our strategic objectives, which is setting us up for long-term growth and success. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thank you, Dave. Our first quarter results were disappointing, as comp sales missed guidance, and we delivered softer net sales and profit than last year. We continued to invest in our initiatives to drive growth, and while we made progress in some areas, we still have upside opportunity in others. This year is one of investment and testing, and we\u2019re very focused on strengthening our foundation for business improvement in the longer-term. We\u2019ve been focused on four initiatives designed to improve our foundation. The first initiative is improving our merchandise assortment, where we are driving newness and differentiation. For example, we increased our organic offerings by 20% since the beginning of the year, and these are important to various demographic groups, including millennials. Our second initiative is focused on membership and decision sciences. We created a new Chief Member Officer, reporting to me, that will own membership data and analytics. This role, which was put in place at the beginning of the quarter, oversees a new team of data scientists, marketing and insights professionals. I\u2019m pleased that the team\u2019s recent new targeted membership efforts give us optimism for the rest of the year. Our third initiative is launching new programs to enhance member value. One example is a groundbreaking new pharmacy program called \u201cFree/4/10,\u201d which provides Plus members with free or discounted prescriptions for five costly diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, mental health, vitamin D deficiency, and prostate health. This program contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. Our fourth initiative is a significant long-term investment in our e-commerce business. We re-launched Club Pickup in every club in the country, resulting in a 37% sales increase in the Club Pickup Program. Members love the convenience benefits of online ordering and easy pickup at the club. I am encouraged that our investments will pay off in the near future. Now, on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined 10.9% to $427 million. The fuel business has experienced significant pricing volatility within the quarter, and as a result, our fuel business lost $9 million this quarter. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation. In Q1, net sales, without fuel, grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion. Comp sales were 0.4%, driven by ticket increases of 60 basis points and by a traffic decline of 20 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, offset by a decline in business member traffic. E-commerce contributed 40 basis points to the comp for the 13-week period. Our gross profit rate declined 15 basis points compared to last year, attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. We will continue to invest in Cash Rewards as Plus penetration grows. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 33 basis points, due to investments in new clubs, e-commerce, and technology. Membership and other income grew 4.9%, with membership income up 7.4%. Operating income declined 8.6% to $436 million. Our merchant teams continue to work on bringing newness and trend-right merchandise into the clubs. We still have opportunities for improvement, and we continue to invest in price to drive value for our members. Comp sales in fresh, freezer, cooler were up in the low single-digits. Meat and deli categories performed well, but our overall food comps, including dairy and produce, were impacted by deflation in these fresh categories. We grew comp sales in dry grocery. This is an area in which we will continue to invest to improve both assortment and member value. Consumables were led by private brand table top programs, offset by ongoing supply issues within baby care. Overall, home and apparel comps were up in the low single-digits. Women and children\u2019s apparel was strong, delivering double-digit comp performance. Patio and seasonal items were down, due to the slow start to spring in key geographies, but mattress and houseware categories grew double-digits in comp sales. In our technology and entertainment business, comp sales were down. TV sales were challenged due to the West Coast port delays, but did pick up later in the quarter once the delays decreased. Our audio sales were strong due to new headphones and soundbars. This category has been part of our initiative to streamline our offering to provide the latest advancements in the technologies that matter and to improve our offerings online. Our health and wellness category benefited from our pharmacy\u2019s introduction of the newly launched Free/4/10 program that I mentioned earlier. This program is being merchandised at our pharmacies and contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. We are optimistic about its ability to continue to drive membership growth. As we continue to enhance and improve our offerings, we are managing our inventory appropriately. Inventory, without fuel, grew 1.9%, primarily attributable to new clubs. Beyond these merchandise areas, membership growth is our number one priority, and we see opportunities to better serve both the Business and the Savings member. Turning to membership, we were encouraged by the momentum in April in both acquisition and renewal counts. This will be a constant focus for us. We see consistent growth in our Plus membership, driven by our national rollout of Cash Rewards last year. We have added over 1.6 million new Plus members since a year ago. Members that have upgraded to a Plus membership are highly engaged, both in clubs and online, and their spending is up over the previous year in the mid to high single-digit range. In addition, the 5-3-1 MasterCard program we launched last year continues to receive industry accolades, but more importantly, receives tremendously positive feedback from our members. When I\u2019m out walking in the clubs and talking with members, they consistently tell me how much they enjoy the benefits of our Cash Rewards program, and our 5-3-1 MasterCard. This is especially true for our small business members as the rewards really add up. Together, these two initiatives continue to meet our expectations in providing membership value. For the long term, we continue to see success in some key strategic areas and will build on these. The integration of digital and physical is a key enabler for our growth. E-commerce delivered a double-digit comp this quarter, contributing 40 basis points to the segment comp. Growth in traffic, ticket, and conversion was driven by strong double-digit Club Pickup comps. We are also leveraging our digital capabilities to drive targeted member growth and renewal. Utilizing our data analytics, we used digital media to reach current and prospective members, but can now align it with system enhancements and better visibility of members\u2019 shopping behaviors. For example, our recent Groupon offer clearly communicated the value of the Sam\u2019s Club membership card and generated more than 220,000 new members in less than two weeks. Ultimately, we know we will attract and retain members by creating irresistible value in our membership. While our business member numbers continue to be challenged, we\u2019re maintaining our focus on turning that trend around. To help them grow, we\u2019ve expanded the value we provide to small business members with the addition in the first quarter of five new or enhanced services through third-parties, identity theft protection; accounting; business lending; payment processing; and online marketing. With these new services, we\u2019ve broadened the portfolio of new business services we launched in the fall, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. The primary purpose of these services is to help our small business members be successful, and create additional membership value from their Sam\u2019s Club card. Although it\u2019s still early, we\u2019ve had positive feedback on our new services. We are intensely focused on addressing top line sales and membership. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 31 to be between flat and up 2%. Now, I\u2019ll pass it over to Charles. Charles? Charles Holley : Thanks, Roz. I will wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance. As you heard, currency exchange negatively impacted our sales by $3.3 billion and earnings per share by $0.03, which was more than we anticipated. Even though our Walmart U.S. comp sales were around the bottom of our guidance, we are pleased with our earnings per share coming in at $1.03, in the middle of our range. Before I move on to our second quarter guidance, it\u2019s important to reiterate that we continue to execute our enterprise strategy, which we feel is creating a stronger foundation for the future. It\u2019s still early days, but it\u2019s important to note, we are managing our capital in a very disciplined way, seeking the right balance between sales growth and profitability as we integrate digital and physical. Based on our views of the global macro-economic environment, and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $1.06 and $1.18. Our second quarter guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.04 per share from our previously announced investments in both associate wages and training, as well as $0.04 per share from currency. Now as a reminder, our full year earnings per share guidance assumes the impact of approximately $0.20 per share from our strategic investments in both associate wages and training, as well as an incremental $0.06 to $0.09 per share in e-commerce investment. In our first quarter, we incurred approximately $0.02 per share from our investment in associate wages and training and an incremental $0.02 per share from our e-commerce investments. In addition to the impact from these two significant investments, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind for the year. Assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on full year net sales would be approximately $14 billion. Now, this compares to our guidance in February of approximately $10 billion. Again, assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on our earnings per share this year would be approximately $0.13 per share, compared to our prior guidance of $0.10 per share. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34% for this fiscal year. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. In February, we indicated that we expected our first quarter effective tax rate to be the highest of all four quarters this year. However, given the fluctuations that I just mentioned, we were below that initial forecast. Before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. You\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. In this fiscal year, we added approximately 4.1 million additional square feet of retail space around the world. Additionally, when there are opportunities that can increase our ability to serve customers and add shareholder value, we will invest beyond our capital plan that we shared in October. Our recent announcement in Canada regarding the acquisition and renovation of specific real estate locations from a competitor for approximately $290 million is a great example of such an opportunity. Our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. It\u2019s important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year. Before I close, I would like to reiterate that working capital management remains a very high priority for us. We acknowledge there\u2019s more work to do across our business, but our leadership teams are committed to further improvement throughout this year. With that, thank you for your support of our company. We hope to see all of you at Shareholders this year.

Doug McMillon : Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter earnings and get an update on how things are progressing relative to our strategy. We just returned from our Wal-Mart U.S. holiday meeting in Denver. As you may know we gather all of our store managers and market managers to talk about the plan for the holiday season and take stock of where are as a business. I can tell you that the feeling in the room was as good as it\u2019s been in years. Our stores in the US are getting better, our associates are happier and our managers are leading it. I talked with our managers about how our company has always changed to serve customers. And we are in another period of change right now. I shared an article from Fortune magazine that I keep in my office titled \u201cCan Wal-Mart get back the magic.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty strong indictment of our future. And the fun fact is that, it was written in 1996. Just as it was in 1996, we will win the future of retail if we make the right choices as a business. We have a strong point of view on what that future will look like. Through technology, data and mobile we have incredible new ways to serve customers today and the opportunities are only growing. We believe the winners in retail will be those who can bring together the best of the offline world with the best of online to serve customer however they want to shop and we believe Wal-Mart has unique competitive advantages in this race. We\u2019re moving forward on our enterprise strategy to position ourselves to win, playing offence, which is the only way to play in retail. This is true around the world, it is not just U.S. opportunity. The changes we need to make require investment and we\u2019re pleased with the steps we\u2019ve taken. We made continued progress towards our plan this quarter. Even if it\u2019s not as fast as we would like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving and it\u2019s reflected in our comps and revenue growth. Our strategy starts with running great stores and clubs. In Denver, we talked about the choices we\u2019re making as a business, as you know in the first quarter we initiated a comprehensive multiyear plan to increase starting wages and training for associates in our U.S. stores and clubs. During the second quarter, we implemented the next phase of changes to our Wal-Mart U.S. store structure including adding department managers. Our focus on running better stores that are clean and well stocked have friendly associates and an efficient checkout is resonating with customers. They have always counted on Wal-Mart to have great prices, now we are building their trust with better in stock and delivering an enjoyable shopping experience. As a result, Wal-Mart U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales as overall net sales grew nearly 5%. Customer traffic was strong again this quarter. Lower gas prices helped. I continue to be encouraged by the sales momentum that we are seeing especially in general merchandize and I\u2019m confident that customers are benefiting from the investments we\u2019re making in our stores and associates. Obviously, we would like to see it ramp higher and faster, we also recognize it won\u2019t be a linear path up into the right but we like the trend line. Although we grew top line sales, we did fall short on managing the bottom line, during the quarter, operating expenses were higher than expected and our gross margin was lower than planned. We are not pleased or satisfied. For the back half of the year, we will manage these items closely with the continued commitment to efficiency, cutting cost where appropriate even in a period of investment.  Similar to the first quarter, Wal-Mart International constant currency sales growth was solid this quarter with Mexico and Canada delivering strong comps. We are also excited about the opportunities we see in China despite slower economic growth and currency pressures. Our position is improving, we are gaining market share in the hypermarket category, Sam\u2019s Club continues to perform well and we have great opportunities in eCommerce. Brazil and UK remain challenging markets but for different reasons. I\u2019m pleased that our U.S. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales improved this quarter and membership income was up close to 6%. Members are recognizing the enhanced value in our plus memberships, which drove continued growth this quarter both in club and online. Another piece of our plan to win is to build and run great eCommerce; we have made a lot of progress improving our mobile and eCommerce capabilities this year with several important milestones in the second quarter. You will hear more details from Neil shortly about the investments that we have made in Pangaea, our global technology platform and the progress on opening our four new fulfillment centers in the United States. These investments are designed to give customers the ability to find what they want more easily and get what they want faster while enabling us to fulfill orders in a more cost effective manner. Another important milestone in the quarter was our acquisition of the remaining stake of Yihaodian, our eCommerce business in China. We are extremely excited about the growth potential of Yihaodian and the opportunity it presents over time to deliver for customers in a seamless manner. In the second quarter, Wal-Mart\u2019s worldwide eCommerce sales grew approximately 16% on a constant currency basis led by solid results in both of our U.S. businesses Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club. The third leg of our strategy is to innovate the future retail by bringing online and offline together. Here we can see the pieces starting to come together. In the U.S., the response to our grocery home shopping offering [has] [ph] been strong, I\u2019m particularly pleased with the number of repeat customers we have and the strength of our average ticket. Anecdotally, I can share that customers have told us it\u2019s changing their perception of the shopping experience at Wal-Mart. In stores, we have been aggressively pursuing store pickup options and pickup while on a very small base in Wal-Mart terms is growing very quickly. At samsclub.com, we are also seeing stronger sales as members appreciate the convenience of our club pickup. We are also focused on leveraging data to bring exciting member relevant merchandise to our clubs and online with an eye towards to growing our share members from the higher income household demographic. Internationally one of the encouraging signs we are seeing in Mexico and Canada is that customers are not only purchasing more in our stores, but also driving sales through eCommerce and mobile commerce. In China, we are expanding our Omni-channel offerings with the new test of in-store pickup of online orders in a number of Shenzhen stores. Chinese customers increasingly value the choice of both picking up their online orders in a local store and having it shipped to their homes. And we have started integrating our digital and physical offering for these customers.  Winning in the future requires change. Change in this case requires investment and investment pressures short-term earnings. Our strategy is designed to create robust and sustainable growth that will deliver return to shareholders. We obviously want to do that in the short and long-term and it all starts by winning with customers. The good news is that our short-term investments helped a build a bridge to the mid and long-term. In the second quarter, Wal-Mart generated more than $120 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share of $1.08. I am encouraged by the improvement in our constant currency sales and recognize that our bottom line results should have been better. We have margin pressure from pharmacy reimbursements and higher shrink than we expected during the quarter. These impacts coupled with higher wage investments impacted EPS. Wal-Mart U.S. is the driver of our bottom line results. With the headwinds I just mentioned continuing the rest of the year and the level of investments we have our operating income will continue to be pressured. We have a strong balance sheet, one that allow us to opportunity to invest significantly in our business and the acquisitions like Yihaodian. You will hear more on the impact of these investments from Charles when he updates EPS guidance.  In the short-term, we expect Wal-Mart U.S. comps to accelerate as the service from our associates gains even more traction with our customer experience. When all of our eCommerce fulfillment investments comes online we expect them to lower our distribution cost in the mid term starting in the fourth quarter and having a larger positive impact next year. Over the longer term, we believe we will continue to grow in key markets around the world and further integrate our store and eCommerce offerings. We know that to deliver for our shareholder in a sustainable way we must first win with our customers and associates. So I am confident that these are the right decisions to position Wal-Mart for the future. Finally, I want to mention an important moment we will observe this week. Nearly 10 years ago our customers and associates on the Gulf Coast were impacted by Hurricane Katrina, throughout the devastation that the residents of this region faced Wal-Mart associates demonstrated extraordinary courage and passion for these communities. I often think how simple acts of kindness can have a dramatic impact. Our people really do make the difference at Wal-Mart, not only for our customers, but also for t he communities we serve. I will look forward to joining our associates and community leaders in New Orleans later this week to look back at this event and to discuss how to get better at disaster resiliency and response.  Now I will turn it over to Neil. Neil Ashe : Thanks Dough. We delivered a lot during the quarter, at Wal-Mart U.S., at Sam\u2019s Club and in our key markets around the world. All possible because of the groundwork we laid over the last few years. As a quick recap, we have re-platformed both our technology and physical distribution network for eCommerce. The technology platform Pangaea is consistently improving the customer experience and conversion for Walmart.com, which has led to solid sales growth. We have created a U.S. grocery home shopping business that is getting great reviews from our customers. And we\u2019ve developed eCommerce at Sam\u2019s Club and in key markets around the world notably in Brazil and in China. All of this was made possible because we have a built talent dense Internet technology company inside of Walt-Mart. We are now able to create new experiences for customers across digital and physical. Overall Global eCommerce constant currency sales grew approximately 16%. GMV or gross merchandise value grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis. The highlight was solid growth in the Walmart.com and samsclub.com U.S. businesses while international was soft due to economic challenges in several of our key markets. Because of the softness in international we are resetting our Global eCommerce sales growth forecast for this fiscal year from the mid 20s to a range in the mid to high teens. As I mentioned both businesses in the U.S. are going very well. A great example of how everything came to life with our Walmart.com Dare to Compare event that we kicked off in July. This event created a perfect opportunity to highlight that customers can trust us to offer them the assortment they want at low prices everyday, not just during a one day sale. We were able to use our technology platform and sophisticated pricing algorithms to help us track and deliver lower pricing than competitors. Given that we\u2019ve tripled our assortment in the past three years, we had more items for customers to shop. Customers could then choose how to get their purchases in the most convenient way for them. We offered customers the option to get orders shipped to their door or to a store with same day pickup. In fact, it led to our biggest day of the year so far for same day pick up. The flexibility of our new platform allowed us to move very quickly and the new site delivered a better, faster shopping experience to customers. And those customers who are shopping on mobile devices had an improved experience, thanks to the responsive design we rolled out in the quarter. We are using eCommerce to bring both new customers to Wal-Mart, as well as to deepen our relationship with our existing customers. On the largest day of our Dare to Compare event, we saw more than double the number of new customers to Walmart.com than a typical day.  During the second quarter, we had a number of milestones for Wal-Mart U.S. We migrated a 100% of customers to the new kart and check out, based on our new technology platform; we delivered responsive design to dynamically adjust the site to whatever device was being used. We started rolling out a significantly enhanced store search capability on mobile. We opened two new automated online fulfillment centers, each bigger than 20 football fields. And we have two more coming this quarter. These fulfillment centers are strategically located across geographies and will begin to serve our customers this holiday. They will be cornerstones of our fulfillment network going forward. We also started a targeted test of an unlimited free shipping program priced at $50 for one year.  I\u2019m also pleased with the expansion and progress on grocery home shopping in the U.S. We are in five markets and sales continue to grow because customers especially moms with children love the convenience of ordering online and having their car loaded at a pickup location. In addition to expanding pickup and stores, we are offering customers remote pickup points that are convenient to them including their corporate campuses. In fact we launched one here at our campus in San Bruno. We have also made great progress at Sam\u2019s Club where we have been tightly aligned with clubs to deliver a better member experience which has helped deliver high growth on samsclub.com. Sam\u2019s delivered new club pick up options to make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pickup at the club. Pre-paid club pick up rolled out across the country and we started testing mobile check in and drive through in several clubs. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online. Knowing that members love the treasure hunt, we launched shocking values on samsclub.com that gives members access to special items at outstanding prices for a very limited time. Our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and we\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in mobile. As I mentioned earlier, sales in our international markets were softer during the second quarter than we\u2019ve seen previously. While still growing, grocery home shopping in the UK has slowed down, commensurate with the market. [As to] [ph] open 14 petrol stations during the second quarter and these were enabled with click and collect lockers for both grocery and general merchandize items. In Brazil, the overall economic environment is very challenging but we have continued to take share in this down market. We are growing sales faster than the market and we are continuing to see growth in GMV. Our team has used this opportunity to build a lean and nimble operating model that can succeed in any market condition. As Doug mentioned, we acquired the remaining shares of Yihaodian in China. In 2012, we became 51% owners and we have seen strong growth since that time. Yihaodian now has about a 100 million registered customers, more than twice as many as when we first invested. Our primary goal is to continue to accelerate Yihaodian\u2019s core eCommerce business and maintain strong local Chinese expertise. Now that we are the sole owners, we will be expanding our leadership team from within the Yihaodian business from within Wal-Mart and from the eCommerce industry in China. We will also leverage Wal-Mart\u2019s global reach and scale to better benefit Yihaodian, including global sourcing. Wong Lu who joined us earlier this year to lead global eCommerce in Asia is overseeing Yihaodian. He brings a strong background in developing digital businesses in China. China is an exciting, dynamic, large and competitive market. We are excited about our long-term opportunity in China. We are delivering important eCommerce capabilities around the world. And ultimately these capabilities are enabling experiences that impact the stores and clubs as well as eCommerce. Customers see us as Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club not a collection of shopping channels. We are delivering experiences on [apps] [ph] and sites and in stores and clubs that come together to differentiate us in the eyes of our customers and members. To remain in leadership position we must continue to invest in technology and people to deliver the customer and member experiences. Now I will turn it over to Greg. Greg? Greg Foran : Thank you, Neil. As Doug mentioned, we are encouraged by our top line growth particularly traffic. Our bottom line came in substantially below what was planned, three major factors contributed to our underperformance, a decline in gross margin primarily related to lower than expected pharmacy reimbursements and accelerating pressures as well as higher than planned investment in store house, which was essential to improving the customer experience. I want to be straight forward; these issues will present continuing profit challenges for the remainder of the year. We are certainly disappointed but we are not standing still. We know we can do better and we will. For the Wal-Mart U.S. business doing better means staying focused on an aggressive strategic plan to improve the customer experience in our stores and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth for the long-term. The strategic plan includes a number of large specific projects that fit within our broader focus on assortment, price, excise and customer experience. This plan requires significant investments and we are confident we are making the right decision for our customers and our business. Amid the investment we are focused on growing sales and controlling cost as you would expect from Wal-Mart, we are staying true to our roots, however we are committed to improving the customer experience and we will protect the investments necessary to achieve this goal. Let me dig in a bit on details, I\u2019m pleased to report that we have seen progress on our top line as net sales for the second quarter were up 4.8% and comp sales increased 1.5%. We also improved inventory making our goal to grow inventory less than sales growth. Additionally, we have seen improvements in traffic and customer experience from these actions. Each decision was in line with the strategy we laid out and progress has been steady and consistent. Let me share with you some of our accomplishments in the first half of this fiscal year, many of which occurred during the second quarter. First across all formats we are focused on improving the shopping experience for our customers with continued our checkout promise initiatives ensuring more registers \u2013 during paid shopping hours, we have invested in providing customers with a cleaner, better maintained shopping environment and we\u2019ve added approximately 1,700 items primarily in grocery to warehouse stocks driving faster replenishment times to the stores and ensuring the product is available for our customers. Second, we are investing in our associates, this April we raised the minimum starting wage in our stores to $9 per hour resulting in over 500,000 associates receiving a raise, this new wage structure is expanding our applicant pool, we are also introducing 8000 new department manager positions, a more focus role that allows the associate to be trained and become more knowledgeable with areas they support providing our customers with a better experience in the store. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on career development role of our associates. Finally we have increased the amount in associate will receive upon being promoted into higher levels of responsibility. These changes gauge pay raises to an additional 150,000 associates who are critical to improving the in store experience. Alongside wage improvement and to support career development we are rolling out new training programs designed to help associates grow their careers at Wal-Mart and provide a better experience for our customers. These programs, which will be, rolled out this fall hands on structured and tailored specifically to a position ensuring that training is relevant to an associate\u2019s current role or to a future role they inspire to achieve. And we piloting new schedule tools that allow associates to select shifts that work best for them, while ensuring the store start appropriately for customer demand. This program is reducing associate absences antennae but in the pilot stools and providing managers with bit of visibility to coverage debts. Lastly were investing in operational improvements in the second quarter we began an over hole about inventory management systems routines and schedules. The customer availability program or CAP will supply decade processes with modern technology and new retains routines that keep associates on the sales floor rather than in the stock room. Processes for truck deliveries at pick times and stocking shows have been significantly simplified bring more associates to be on the floor during peak customer traffic.  We\u2019ve also begun rolling out MC40 technology tool department managers. The smaller more and initiative hand Hill tool allows us to replace the current devices with one that can provide enhanced technology. This will simplify how our associates work in a way that was not possible before. Additionally this month store managers are receiving mobile tablets that will help them stay connected to the business, while keeping them on the sales floor to help our customers and associates. As part of their focus on EDLC we have reduce supply marketing funds that have traditionally offset a portion of our advertising expenses as we work towards better product costs. This will translate into lower prices for our customers. As a result of this reduction we have lowered our second quarter print advertising count from 20 pieces last year to just four pieces this year. Moreover since June, we\u2019ve been working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our suppliers driving consistency and simplification across the business. We\u2019ve also reinstated our shrink training program for our asset protection and store management teams as part of our efforts to improve in this area. And finally, we have reduced feature and modular changes across the store ensuring there is space for each feature and associate how to make these changes. Along with this reduction with most and featuring [indiscernible] decisions back to the stores allowing them to sit features that best inline to the local customer needs and preferences. Also are numerous initiatives being landed across our business, these are being executed in a coordinated and systematic fashion to allow us to achieve our full potential. We are pleased with our progress in the first half of the year, but we recognize that we still have a lot to do to meet your long-term goals and that it will take time to get where we want to be. I recognize each section has and we\u2019ll continue to pressure our bottom line, but they are already driving meaningful improvements. Over the past year we\u2019ve seen growth and store traffic and Comp sales. Additionally, our customer satisfaction schools continue to improve. Every day a sample of customers in every store right us across a number of matrix including providing a faster checkout, friendly service and clean store environment based on the writings from the surveys we can see that our stores are making significant improvement from the baseline and we expect that trend to continue. Improving the customer experience is fundamental to our success. Finally, we are proud of the impact these decisions have had on our associates. Nearly 80% of about 1.2 million US store associates participated in our annual associate\u2019s survey administered during this quarter. Our associate\u2019s engagement has increased approximately 100 basis points this year after remaining static for the prior two years. We have remain committed to the strategy we laid out for you earlier this year ensuring we making the right decisions to benefit both our customers and our associates and to drive long-term sustainable growth. We know we will continue to face considerable challenges, but our goal for the back half of this year is to build on the improvements in top line and customer experience and a list of things to accomplish is even longer. Now let\u2019s cover the details on our financial performance for the second quarter. Net sales increased $3.4 billion or 4.8% versus last year. Comparable store sales were up 1.5% and driven by strength in traffic, which increased 1.3%, traffic was particularly strong on the general merchandise and soft line side of the box. Seasonal categories resonated well with customers and changes and replenishment strategies ensured product was on the shows when and where customers needed. Finally eCommerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Neil shared the details on our progress on technology, infrastructure and fulfillment for Wal-Mart.com orders. We are pleased that these efforts will position us even more competitively for the back half of the year. Our grocery home shopping pilots remain underway in five key markets. And we are happy with increased customer accounts in these areas. All formats delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter in particular comps in neighborhood markets were up approximately 7.3%. We remain encouraged by the performance of this format. As mentioned the general merchandize since top line side of the super center performed well this quarter driving strong traffic in sales growth through relevant offerings and better in stock positions. While warm weather particularly in July helped propel sales in seasonal categories, our ongoing focus on the basics across apparel, indoor home and hard lines drove momentum throughout the quarter. Additionally while we show shift back-to-school sales into August as several states adjusted the timing of the tax free weekends early indications are positive. Health and wellness benefited from continued growth and pharmacy scripts along with new brands in optical and our focus on better in stock positions in OTC. And while we saw improved trends in our entertainment business from in stocks and stronger online sales comps continue to run negative pressured by ongoing industry declines in the shift from post-paid to installment wireless plans. On the grocery side of the box, consumables had positive comps, driven by a strong base business. New products particularly in chemicals drove additional momentum; more noticeably continued pressure in food from declining inflation negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 60 basis points. Moving to the reminder of our financials, gross profit rate declined 41 basis points this quarter. As I said before, this was driven by a handful of key issues. Let\u2019s talk about pharmacy. Reflecting industry wide trends, we are seeing reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, which is negatively impacting gross margin. We are also seeing a lower mix of higher margin cash transactions reflecting a marketplace shift in which more customers are now benefiting from greater drug insurance coverage. While we are taking a number of actions to listen the impact we expect to have pressure on pharmacy for the rest of the fiscal year. Additionally, inventory shrinkage was meaningfully higher than planned for the quarter. We are reviewing the end-to-end inventory management process with a special focus on shrinkage and working to close gaps. Investments are being made in training programs store and asset protection associates as well investments in staffing and high shrink areas of the store. But it will take time to see results, so this will impact us versus planned for the rest of the year. Operating expenses deleveraged 50 basis points to last year primarily due to our higher than planned investments in customer experience. These investments included the planned wage rate increases and structural changes I mentioned earlier as well as additional associate hours needed to improve customer service. This quarter, we thoughtfully added back half to specific areas of the store such as front end and stocking positions.  This was a strategic decision to invest where we can drive the most benefit for our customers. These adds were significant and more than we had planned but we felt it was a right decision to meet the goals we have set. And we\u2019ve started to see the investment translate into better top line performance. The focus on customer experience along with ongoing investments in eCommerce and the reduction in gross profit rate led to an operating income decline of approximately 8.2% versus last year. Moving on in the second quarter, total inventory grew slower in the rate of sales at 2.2%. Comp store inventory declined by 2.4% versus last year. The majority of this improvement came from decisions we\u2019ve made regarding replenishment strategies whereby we strategically moved inventory for certain items upstream from our store backrooms to our distribution centers. Additionally, we continued our focus on clearing our backroom of inventory improving operational efficiency in the stores. These actions along with better management of seasonal inventory and reducing modular changes and future shipments to the stores allowed us to reduce comp store inventory while improving both in stock levels and sales. Inventory management will continue to be an ongoing focus for us. This quarter we opened 16 supercenters including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 22 traditional format neighborhood markets and the final six of our smaller format neighborhood market test locations. As we think about future store openings, we will continue to focus on quality versus quantity. Having opened more than 350 neighborhood markets in the past two years, we have a better understanding of what customers value most from the choice of location to the size of the box to the product offerings. Based on these learnings, we have decided not to pursue a number of potential locations as they would not provide the type of quality experience customers expect from a neighborhood market. We now expect to open a total of 160 to 170 neighborhood markets in fiscal 2016 including the 51 locations already opened. Our previous forecast was to open between 180 and 200 neighborhood markets; we are still on track to do approximately 60 to 70 supercenters this year, which was our original forecast. We know that we still have a lot of work to do to achieve the long-term goals we have set in business, the investments we\u2019re making along with the headwinds we\u2019ve mentioned will weigh more heavily on operating income than initially forecasted. Amidst the pressures we are thoughtfully evaluating every decision and use of company resources as we go through the back half of the year. But we are confident in the direction we are headed. We are seeing improvements everyday from sales and traffic growth to increased customer satisfaction to more engaged associates. For the third quarter, we expect our ongoing investments in stores and customer experience to drive further sales momentum offset partially by continued deflationary pressures in food especially in meat and dairy. For the 13 week period ending October 30, we anticipate a comp sales increase of approximately 1% to 2%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were up 0.5%. Now I will turn it over to Dave for an update on Wal-Mart\u2019s International. Dave? Dave Cheesewright : Thanks Greg. The international business had a fairly solid quarter given tough economic environments in certain markets and ongoing currency impacts. In Q2, we saw accelerating sales growth in Mexico and Canada offsetting ongoing challenges in the UK, Brazil and China. Overall I continue to be enthusiastic about our long-term prospects to profitably grow our international business in a controlled and disciplined manner.  Similar to last quarter, the performance in Mexico and Canada continue to be solid. Our Mexico team has done an excellent job reenergizing that business driving strong performance across all formats. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in Mexico along with the improving core business. In Canada, we continue to gain market share driven by our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps. These two markets will continue to play a key role in our back half performance. I\u2019ll provide more details on key market performance in a few minutes.  Now let\u2019s jump to overall results. In the second quarter net sales grew 2.8% on a constant currency basis despite headwinds in Latin America from lapping last year\u2019s World Cup and the timing shifted Easter. The U.S. dollar remains strong, which led to a currency impact of $4.2 billion resulting in a 9.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were positive in Mexico and Canada while the UK, Brazil and China posted negative comps. All other markets had positive comp sales. Operating income declined 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Negatively impacted by increased employment claim contingences and higher than expected utility rates in Brazil as well as continued investments in global ecommerce. This was partially offset by gains from the sale of the bank operations in Mexico and certain properties in Canada. Excluding the impact of these items operating income would have grown faster than sales. With the currency exchange impact operating income decreased 14.2%. On a constant currency basis inventory grew faster than sales of 4.2% driven primarily by slower sales in U.K. On a reported basis inventory declined 10.5%. Now let\u2019s discuss market results presented on a constant currency basis for largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China financial results are inclusive of ecommerce.  Let\u2019s start with the UK the market remained highly competitive during the second quarter with significant ongoing volunteering for most of this competitors. Gross deflation remained at near record levels as prices decreased 1.7% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended June 21 according to Kenta. The total market declined 9.1% a reversal from a slight growth in Q1 in part due to the timing of Eastern. UK sales declined 4.1% and comp sales excluding fuel were down 5.2% driven by declining traffic especially in fresh fruit categories. Grocery and shopping sales continue to grow and we remain focused on driving improvements to our customer metrics. Operating income increased year-over-year mostly driven by the timing of Easter and margin improvement in non-food categories from a favorable mix shift  For the rest of the year we focused on strengthening these assortments in private label and improving pricing on national brands. We will continue to drive aggressive cost reduction initiatives supporting our $1 billion pound, five year price investment strategy. We\u2019re investing to improve store standards and on shelf availability and to maintain recent improvements in grocery and shopping service metrics. In addition, we launched our new branding and marketing campaign based around adoption of the Wal-Mart save money live better mission to help build brand and quality perception. Collectively these actions are designed to address some of the challenges we face in store traffic and fresh food. Let\u2019s now discuss Mexico, which released the earnings on July 21. Please note that Wal-Mart release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S GAAP therefore some number may differ. Consolidated Wal-Mart\u2019s net sales increased 7.2% with solid comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.4% and comp sales increased 5.4%. We continue to seek strong comps across all formats including Sam\u2019s Club, which delivered 4.6% comp growth. Self service continues to gain share and delivered the 190 basis point improvement in market share according to [indiscernible]. General merchandise performed very well at 4.9% comp growth despite a top year-over-year comparison from last year World Cup. Operating income grew faster than sales. The sale of that banking unit in the second quarter along with the Whips restaurant divesture last fiscal year helps us focused on our core business, which is our strength. We are intense on being the most relevant retailer for customers through excellent prices, great assortments and consistent execution. We remain confident that the steps we have in place to improve Walmax are working and will serve as a catalyst raw business over the long-term.  In Canada, sales grew 5.4% and comps grew 3.9% in a low growth economic environment driven by strong performance in food, health and wellness, home and toys. We are investing in price and value as we look for opportunities to lower costs in our business. We continue to gain share in our core categories of food, health and wellness, and infant categories as per Neilson data for the 12 weeks ended July 18. Additionally our Canadian eCommerce business grew sales at more than 40% will be on a small base, in July we successfully launched our online grocery business, starting with 11 store pickup locations in the Ottawa area. In addition to top line performance, we remain focused on our low cost operating model. Operating income grew significantly faster than sales. In the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 13 stores and one distribution center from a former competitor, seven of the stores are planned to open by end of this fiscal year and the remainder will open next year. In May, we also closed the sale of portfolio properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner, which generated the previously mentioned gain. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our results in Canada and expect consistent profitable growth to continue. In Brazil, the country is facing a prolonged recession and a highest inflation rate in 12 years, driven in part by electricity rate increase is a more than 50% versus last year, which is driving a cautious approach to consumption. For Wal-Mart Brazil, net sales declined 9% and comp sales were down 1%, largely impacted by the World Cup event held during the same period last year and the timing of the yester holiday. We experienced a decline in the hyper market format driven by electronics but are pleased with the double digit comp sales increases in the wholesale business. Brazil operating income declined for the quarter, driven by the previously mentioned employment claims and rapidly raising utility rates compared to last year. The management team is making progress on the operational, people and legal fronts to address ongoing employment claims as they work through a challenging business environment. In addition, they are focused on key leverage initiatives to increase store productivity and help offset inflationary pressure. We continue to make progress on converting stores and distribution centers to standardize systems, which provides better visibility to business results leverages costs and reduces compliance risk. Last year, we integrated all of our stores in the South region, this year; we are focused on converting the south IDC network as well as approximately 100 stores in the north east. Next year, we plan to convert the remaining north east stores and dry DCs to this unified platform. Despite challenging market conditions, the eCommerce business in Brazil continues to perform well. Sales grew double-digits and outpaced the Brazilian eCommerce market. Market share rose from 8% to 8.5% in Q2 according to EBIT and eCommerce research firm with share gains in several categories including babies, toys, and games, and auto parts. Market place sales growth was also strong. Last, let\u2019s discuss China. Wal-Mart China sales grew 1.2% while comp sales declined 1.4%, Wal-Mart increased market share and fast moving consumer goods in the hyper market channel and maintained share in the modern trade channel which includes smaller format stores for the 12 weeks ended June 28 according to Neilson. While there are ongoing market headwinds from slow economic growth, we\u2019re are confident we\u2019ll continue to delivery sustainable growth in China. Wal-Mart continues to outperform the market and gain market share in hypermarkets for the tenth quarter in a row. We are focused on driving efficiency, reducing expenses and strengthening our portfolio through we operate for less and we buy for less initiatives. These actions contributed operating income growing significantly faster than sales. The team continues to set the foundation for our business positioning for increased growth and profitability in the future. Throughout the quarter, we made significant progress in our omni-channel efforts. Wal-Mart China launched Wal-Mart To Go in 23 stores in Shenzhen bringing customers the convenience of ordering through the Wal-Mart app and the choice of pick up in store delivery to their home. We\u2019re also testing ways to bring added payment choices and the convenience of mobile payment to our customers in our stores. In addition as Doug and Neil mentioned we increase our ownership of Yihaodian, China eCommerce platform to 100%. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity to deliver new experiences to customers in China and further leverage Yihaodian and Wal-Mart\u2019s global and local assets. In the second quarter, Yihaodian grew sales double-digits driven by strong growth in orders and continued improvement in conversion rates. Mobile contributed more than 55% of orders. As I wrap up the international portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to express how pleased I am with our associates around the globe and their efforts in driving consistent and solid performance in the first half. With growing comp sales across the majority of our portfolio and stepping up investments in eCommerce, well setting our business up for long-term success. We expect continued economic challenges in the UK and Brazil but also expect continued strong performance in Mexico and Canada. We are optimistic about our growth prospects in China despite the softening economy and we will continue to invest in that market. Now I will turn over to Rose for an update on Sam\u2019s. Rose? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks Dave. We were pleased that our investments are contributing to improvement in Sam\u2019s Club. In the second quarter, we grew comp sales without \u2013 1.3% and net sales 2.8%. Our square footage also grew due to three new clubs opening during the quarter. We are accelerating our efforts to strengthen the Sam\u2019s Club member value proposition. Since last year, our investments have been targeted to better merchandize assortment, membership acquisition, engagement and retention, new programs to enhance member value and our investment in eCommerce.  By staying on a consistent path and driving these priorities we continue to simplify our business. We saw the benefits in improved membership trends in higher traffic during the second quarter what is most important is the overwhelmingly positive feedback we are hearing from our members not just about our clubs but also about improvement in the eCommerce experience. I will provide some examples shortly. Now on to the numbers, with fuel operating income declined by 13.4% to $428 million, fuel profitability improved from Q1 but it is still below planned levels and below last year\u2019s dollars. For additional results with fuel please reference the accompanying presentation. Net sales without fuel grew 2.8%, comp sales without fuel were up 1.3% with ticket contributing 80 basis points and traffic 50 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive partially offset by a decline in business member traffic.  Our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points versus last year driven in part by our ongoing cash rewards investment, increased seasonal markdowns and industry headwinds in pharmacy prescriptions similar to those referenced in the Wal-Mart U.S. business. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 13 basis points due to continued investments in new clubs, technology and eCommerce. Membership and other income grew 6.1% with membership income up 5.8% driven in large part by plus upgrades.  As a result of both of these factors, operating income declined 9.7% versus last year. We continue to manage our inventory appropriately, inventory without fuel grew by 3.4% driven in part by new clubs. In our merchandizing areas, let me start by highlighting two of our stronger categories home and apparel and health and wellness. Home and apparel delivered low single-digit comp sales with strength and apparel offset by softness in kitchen electrics, domestics, and furniture. Health and wellness posted mid-single digit comps driven by generics and by increase member adoption of our Free/4/10 prescription program. Since the launch of this program last quarter for plus members we see that those who utilize the program transfer on average two thirds of their scripts to Sam\u2019s Club. We are optimistic that these trends will continue to drive traffic. Our fresh freezer cooler business was softer than expected due to deflation and key dairy commodities such as milk and cheese along with higher costs in areas such as meat. Grocery and beverages delivered low single-digit comps with dry grocery delivering solid comp sales. The consumables business also delivered low single-digit comps driven by laundry and tabletop categories. Our technology, entertainment, and office businesses I\u2019ll be at posting negative comments saw improvement from Q1 levels. We thought acceleration in certain key categories such as tablets that was offset in part by a wireless business which is been negatively impacted by the industry shift to installment plans. We continue to make progress in eCommerce to build the most convenient club in the industry. We are pleased with her ongoing integration of digital and physical. ECommerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to our club comp performance during the period and traffic to our site was up just over 20%. We delivered the new club pickup options that make it easier and more convenient for members to shop online and pick up at the club. Prepay club pickup rolled out across the country and we started testing mobile check-in and drive through in several clubs.  The number of members trying it for the first time during the quarter exceeded our expectations and we expect ongoing acceptance of the service. We have also improved the assortment and pricing online knowing that members love the treasure hunt we launched shocking values they give members access to special items at outstanding prices for very limited time. Shocking values products are carefully chosen based on member\u2019s interest top trends and items from the company\u2019s most popular shopping categories. In addition, our enhancements to mobile have also built on our member experience and drove double-digit growth in traffic. Membership income was up versus last year with growth driven by social media campaigns as well as strong plus renewals and upgrades due to the benefits of cash rewards. We also continue to emphasize our award-winning Sam\u2019s Club 531 MasterCard which allows members to save inside and outside the club. We have received very positive feedback from our members on this program. We recently hosted our annual supplier Summit here in Bentonville and we were pleased with the excellent attendance and engagement our suppliers are very interested in the work we\u2019ve done to ensure their grade items are getting in front of our member base. They are supportive of the innovation and merchandising transformation we have in place. We have great items coming for the holidays. We are focused on further progress in the Sam\u2019s Club business for the back half of the year. For the 13-week period ending October 30, 2015 we expect comp sales without feel to be between flat and up 2%.  Now I will turn things over to Charles. Charles. Charles Holley : Thanks Ros. I will start with the top line. We are pleased with the sales increase as we saw in the U.S. as well is in our international businesses when considering cost of currency. We believe traffic and comp sales increases for Wal-Mart U.S. show we are on the right track with their investments. Wal-Mart U.S. now has had positive comps for four straight quarters. As expected these investments impacted both operating expenses and profits. In addition, Wal-Mart U.S. experienced gross margin pressure from pharmacy and shrink that we had not expected. Looking forward at the rest of the year operating profit will be pressured more than we originally planned this is primarily driven by the headwinds to Wal-Mart U.S. gross margins that I just mentioned.  We will continue to scrutinize and evaluate how we manage our capital in order to optimize both the customer experience and returns. Before I turn to guidance, let me cover some other items. You may have read in our earnings release, that we are reviewing leases across all of our segments. This is part of a comprehensive ongoing lease review. One item that we are focusing on and may need to be corrected relates to leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lesser construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. This results in capitalizing these leased assets on our balance sheet. We don\u2019t know the impact of our financial statements but believe it mostly to be a balance sheet issue at this time. We will provide more information once the review is complete. Turing to cash, during the quarter we spent approximately $760 million to acquire the remaining shares of Yihaodian. A strategic acquisitions for eCommerce growth in China. In addition, we continued to provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases and then a second quarter we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $1 billion of shares. This represents our larger share purchase activity in the last four quarters. As always, we will remain opportunistic with repurchase throughout the year, as of the end of the second quarter we had approximately $9 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization. Membership and other income increased 13.9% to $899 million. Other income primarily benefited from the gain on the sale of the bank operations in Mexico. FCPA and compliance related costs were approximately $30 million comprised of approximately $23 million for the ongoing enquires in investigations and approximately $7 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance related costs were $43 million in the second quarter. We expect FCPA related expenses to continue to turn down so we now expect our full year FCPA related expenses to range between $130 million and $150 million. This compares to our guidance in February of $160 million to $180 million. Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2015 with 16.2% which compares to 16.7% last year. The decline in our ROI has primarily been due to continued capital investments as well as our decrease in operating income. Earlier, Greg mentioned that as part of our commitment to EDLC, we are working on amending terms and allowance agreements with our Wal-Mart US suppliers. To drive simplicity and consistence across our business. We began this effort in June and discussions will continue over the coming months. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales. While we are pleased with the progress in managing our inventories, working capital is still an opportunity for us to generate stronger free cash flow. Now let\u2019s turn our attention to guidance. In February, we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.70 and $5.05. Today, we expect our fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $4.40 and $4.70 including a range of $0.93 and a $1.05 for the third quarter. This new range includes the following updated assumptions. First, the impact from our investments and wages, training, and additional hours in our stores will be approximately $0.24 including approximately $0.80 in the third quarter. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.10 of the expected full year impact, this compares to our original guidance in February of approximately $0.20. As you heard from Greg earlier, our decision to increase associate hours beyond our February plan to areas of the store such as front end and stocking positions are intended to drive the most benefit for our customers. Next the incremental investment in global eCommerce will range between $0.06 and $0.09, this is unchanged from our guidance in February. In the third quarter, we expect the impact to be approximately $0.02. Through the first half of this year, we have incurred approximately $0.04 of the expected full-year impact. Third, we expect the full-year impact of approximately $0.11 including approximately $0.03 in the third quarter for unplanned headwinds that I discussed earlier. The headwinds are primarily in Wal-Mart U.S. pharmacy margins as well as higher than expected stream continuing through this fiscal year. Assuming currency exchanges remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full-year impact to be approximately $0.15 up $0.02 from last quarter\u2019s revised guidance of $0.13. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 32% and 34% unchanged from our guidance in February. Now as a remainder our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and maybe impacted by number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances. Changes in law, outcomes, the administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations and in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. We will host our annual investment meeting in New York on October 14. As we have in previous annual investment community meetings, we will provide an update on our capital plans at that time. We look forward to seeing you there. Thank you for your interest in Wal-Mart and have a great day.

Global unit count data is also on our Investors website. When we refer to traditional neighborhood markets in Wal-Mart U.S., we're discussing those that average 42,000 ft.\u00b2 of retail space. The smaller neighborhood markets range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 ft.\u00b2. As a reminder, for fiscal 2016, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based upon 13- and 52-week periods respectively. Our Q3 reporting period ran from Saturday, August 1, through Friday, October 30, 2015. Now let's get on to today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about our results in the context of our overall strategy. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will cover the financial details. Next we'll begin our operating segments with Greg Foran, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S.; followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International; and then Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Last, Charles Holley, Wal-Mart's CFO, will wrap up with details on guidance for fourth quarter and the full year. Now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third-quarter earnings, as well as the strategy we shared at our annual meeting to the investment community last month. Overall we had a good quarter. We delivered earnings per share well within our guidance range, recorded our fifth straight quarter of positive comps at Wal-Mart U.S. and had solid international sales and profit growth on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we still have plenty of work to do and there are areas of our business that must perform better. Our earnings per share were $1.03 and we posted total revenue of $117.4 billion. I want to highlight that on a constant currency basis, our total revenue would have been $122.4 billion. That's growth of $3.4 billion or 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which is solid growth. Even if the percentage doesn't sound high because we have such a large denominator, not many companies grow by this amount in a quarter. I call this out because I don't want the currency impacts to obscure the strength of our business. We are a growth company and we're growing. As we expected, operating income continued to be pressured by our decision to invest in our frontline associates. To improve the store experience for our customers and create a bridge to our future where digital capabilities will play an increasing role in our stores, we're making a $1.2 billion planned investment in our people this year that we understood what impact near-term operating income. This is by far the biggest driver of the decline in consolidated operating income. Before going into the details, I want to take a step back to talk about our strategy. At our investor meeting last month, we shared more detail than usual about the next three years of our growth plan. We've never been a company that manages only for the short term and that's certainly true during this period of change. Although investments in our people and technology impact near-term earnings, they will help us deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time. We're confident these are the right steps because we know where and how we're going to win. We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. No matter how you choose to shop with us, through your mobile device, online, in a store, or a combination, it will be fast and easy. Online retailers are testing physical store experiences because they recognize the same [audio gap] network of stores supported by a supply chain and systems like ours with an emerging set of digital capabilities to win with customers. As we create this seamless experience we're positioning for growth in five key areas. First, we will continue to win on value. We've won on value in the past and that won't change. Second, convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time. Third, we will always work to be great merchants whether in stores or online. Fourth, we're focused on the key geographies for customer growth which are North America and China. Finally, we want to appeal to a blend of income levels the way we're approaching e-commerce, neighborhood markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas we'll appeal to value conscious customers of all demographics. We already serve customers from all income levels around the world but we have an opportunity to get even stronger. By taking these steps we will grow the company faster. We will add between $45 and $60 billion of revenue to the company in the next three years. That's a lot of growth. It just happens to be on a big base. Returning to this quarter's results, one of the most important takeaways is that U.S. stores continue to improve with total net sales up nearly 4%. In addition to positive comp sales, Wal-Mart U.S. had its fourth straight quarter of positive traffic. We're now lapping positive comp sales and building on our progress. Our customers are telling us that our efforts around clean, fast and friendly are resonating. Neighborhood markets continued to show strong sales led by newer stores and have posted positive comps for 19 consecutive quarters. A key part of creating a seamless shopping experience is to have great stores and we feel good about where we're headed. We also made strides in the U.S. on adding critical capabilities to our supply chain. In the third quarter, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta with more than 1 million ft\u00b2 of space. This is our fifth next-generation fulfillment center. As we build out our e-commerce capabilities we are deepening our digital relationships with our customers. We've accelerated our expansion of online grocery pickup and we've seen that customers who start using online grocery spent nearly 50% more than similar customers who shop only in stores. This is the customer we're going after. The shopper in our sweet spot who accesses Wal-Mart in multiple ways. We also began the chain-wide use of a mobile service that can tell us when a customer is coming to pick up an online general merchandise order before they even walk into the store. We launched a new digital wish list that you can build at home or simply by scanning items in a store. We expect more than 210 million visits to our app in November and December up from 18 million in 2012. Last month, we told you about our longer-term plans to grow e-commerce sales and GMB. That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way but we are confident in our targets. We continue to expect to grow mid to high teens for this fiscal year. During the third quarter, global e-commerce sales and GMB growth both came in at around 10%, this was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets including Brazil China and the U.K. In the U.S. where we've seen good growth for the year, we continue to make progress on key initiatives. But we know we have more work to do. I was pleased that SamsClub.com continued to deliver strong growth. In Wal-Mart International we're pleased with the solid 3.2 sales growth on a constant-currency basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5% excluding currency. Our North American markets delivered strong performance and Mexico in particular is starting to fire on all cylinders. I'm pleased with our momentum in these markets we continue to face specific challenges in the U.K. and Brazil. China remains a huge long term opportunity. We started in China in 1996. We've grown the business, reached profitability years ago and grown our level of profitability. We obviously learned a lot about Chinese customers and the market and that's an asset. A few weeks ago I was back in Beijing and Shanghai walking stores, clubs and visiting our e-commerce offices. We now have a total of 12 Sam's Clubs open and they're performing very well. Our stores have clearly improved operationally in recent years in particular and now they're supported by a supply chain that positions us to win. We see that e-commerce, online grocery and convenience are critical in the dense urban areas that make up so much of the Chinese opportunity. That's why our Yihaodian acquisition is of such strategic significance. We also recommitted to our work on food safety, environmental sustainability and empowering women during my visit, announcing another investment in the China Women's Development Foundation. With the improvements we've made to our stores and clubs and the full acquisition of Yihaodian we have a unique opportunity and a plan to put it all together to win in China. While positive, our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales without fuel were at the low end of our guidance. We were pleased with the growth of membership income but we can do better with our overall results. Sam's Club did take important steps this quarter to deepen digital relationships with our members through club pickup, expanded mobile check-in capabilities and extended drive-through or curbside options. Roz will share more about our strategy going forward in a moment. In addition to releasing earnings, today is a big day at our home office. We're holding a sustainability milestone meeting to celebrate 10 years of progress on sustainability since our then-CEO Lee Scott delivered a landmark speech titled 21st-Century Leadership. In those remarks, Lee laid out three big bills for Wal-Mart: to be powered by 100% renewable energy; to create zero waste; and to sell products that sustain people and the environment. It was a defining moment for our company. By looking through the lens of sustainability, Lee realized we could think about problems in creative ways, make our business more efficient and bring renewed passion to our work. It was and is inspiring to be part of this journey. Today we'll mark how far we've come and what we've achieved. For example, the savings we've generated from reducing waste, running our truck fleet more efficiently and pursuing energy efficiency has been good for society and good for our shareholders. We're getting excited to take the next steps in this journey early next year. In true Wal-Mart fashion we're looking at ways to make a difference in the world, serve our stakeholders and drive our bottom line. Let me reiterate that we are excited about the unique opportunity we have to create a seamless shopping experience for our customers and ensure sustainable growth for the business. We're making critical investments to better serve our customers, associates and shareholders, and we are on the right path. As I close I want to pause to thank Charles Holley for his years of outstanding service to Wal-Mart. As you know, he's made the decision to retire. He's been a huge asset to the company and a great partner to me and the leadership team. This is his last earnings call and he will be missed. Thank you, Charles. Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire? Claire Babineaux-Fontenot: Thanks, Doug. Today I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that, although immaterial, impacts comparability against last year. As we disclosed in the second quarter, we conducted a global review of the accounting treatment for leases, which included a focus on leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. In the third quarter, we finalized this review and recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment. On a consolidated basis, the immaterial adjustment increased total assets by approximately $1.7 billion, which was primarily an increase in property under capital lease and financing obligations; increased total liabilities by approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily an increase in current and long-term capital lease and financing obligations; and it positively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Let's now move to our results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart EPS were $1.03, which includes the items mentioned above. Additionally, there were significant items that negatively impacted EPS including investments and wages and training, in the U.S. of approximately $0.10 and currency exchange rate movements totaling $0.04. Last year's EPS was $1.15. Total revenue reached $117.4 billion. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $5 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $122.4 billion. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 basis points compared to last year. Primarily as a result of investments in store wages and labor hours in the U.S. Additionally, as CPA and compliance related cost were $30 million. Comprised of $22 million for ongoing inquiries and investigation, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year FCPA and compliance related costs were approximately $41 million. The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.8% to $5.7 billion. Excluding the impact from currency of approximately $214 million, operating income decreased by 5.4%. Primarily related to the factors that increased our operating expenses. I'll close today's discussion with a few comments on returns. At Wal-Mart we remain committed to providing good returns for our shareholders. During last month's meeting for the investment community, we announced a new share purchase authorization of $20 billion, and said that our intention is to utilize this authorization over a two-year period. The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $437 million during the third quarter. Return on investment ROI for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2015 was 15.9% versus 16.4% for the prior comparable period. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments. Thank you for listening. And now I will turn it over to Greg. Greg? Greg Foran : Thank you, Clair. Last month at our annual meeting for the investment community I spoke in detail about how Wal-Mart U.S. will execute our part of the plan to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience of scale. We will drive growth and deliver shareholder returns by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants, and providing our customers with the convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy. Although we are in the early stages of our journey we are confident in our plan and we are executing against it. Now let's talk about our Q3 performance. As we've said before, we continue to measure our success in terms of traffic, in-stock and customer experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the top line. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 3.8%. Unit sales picked up, and traffic strengthened improving 40 basis points from Q2 to 1.7%. This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic growth for Wal-Mart U.S. Our comp sales growth of 1.5% was solidly within our guidance despite minimal food inflation. In-stocks improved while comp store inventory declined. Our customers told us they are happy with the improvements we're making in the shopping experience as reflected in our customer experience scores. To date, 70% of our stores have achieved the initial goal we set for them. And we will raise the bar for next year. We also saw some progress this quarter in gross margin with the work we've put in on pharmacy markdowns and shrink. However, as we've discussed before, the investments in our stores and our associates are significant and will continue to pressure the bottom line. All formats in our portfolio had positive comps this quarter. We are happy with the progress we've made in our Supercenters which saw continued traffic growth and positive comps across all areas except entertainment. Our traditional format neighborhood markets delivered an approximate 8% comp in the third quarter. A 70 basis point acceleration from our Q2 comp and aided by strong performance in our less mature stores. New technology and processes are improving end stocks and we're working hard on providing the best associate coverage to most effectively serve our customers. Most importantly, Fresh remains a key focus. We're encouraged by our newest prototype, which features better sightlines and displays. We've seen Fresh penetration expand in the store relative to its peers. We've made solid progress this year but we still have a ways to go to ensure we're creating the best experience for our customer while simultaneously improving the profitability of this format. In e-commerce, we made strides on deepening the digital relationship with our customer. This quarter we accelerated our online grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations. We now have almost 140 locations across 25 markets that offer the customer the ability to order their groceries online and conveniently pick up at a time of their choosing. We also launched a new mobile service which alerts us when a customer is coming to pick up their online general merchandise order even before they walk into the store. And just in time for the holidays, we introduced a digital wish list that can be built at home or by simply scanning items while at the store. E-commerce sales and traffic were softer than we would like. We'll continue to strive to balance sales growth and profitability. Overall, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 15 basis points to our comp. From a merchandise perspective, we saw growth across most of the store, particularly in our apparel, hardlines, home and seasonal businesses. While warmer weather somewhat slowed performance in October, solid back to school and Halloween seasons, along with new launchers such as Pioneer Woman and STAR WARS drove mid-single-digit comps across each of these departments. Continued growth in prescription count and branded drug inflation drove mid-single-digit comps in Health and Wellness. As you see, it was also strong as better end stocks, particularly in Vitamins, helped drive sales. In Food, we saw our best top line results of the year despite minimal inflation, which negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 90 basis points. Momentum from a solid Labor Day weekend continued through to Halloween. We're particularly pleased with the results in Fresh, where we brought in new products, developed strong price leadership through strategic buys and promoted locally sourced and organic products. While most of the box continued to grow, we still have considerable headwinds in Entertainment. A slow adoption of new technology in televisions and the shift from post-paid to installment wireless plans contributed to disappointing sales results. We're working on improving our operating model in this area both in terms of service to our customers and in the layout of the department. We've made some progress this year, including the recent remodel of the Rogers Akinsource [ph] supercenter we showed you last month, but it will take time to get this department where it needs to be. Moving on to the remainder of our financials, gross margin increased 32 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in Food, General Merchandise and Consumables but was somewhat offset by declines in Health and Wellness. Reimbursement levels continued to pressure pharmacy profits; however, we've made some strides across several initiatives that improved margins in this department versus Q2. Additionally, we remain focused on our urgent agenda items, including better management of markdowns to zero. Finally, while only just beginning to show in our results, we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink, which has been a significant headwind for us this year. As we've said before, our top priority this year is to provide a better customer experience in our stores. We're committed to actions that help accomplish this goal as we have invested this year in our associates and in improving our stores. These investments are substantial and continue to reflect in our bottom line performance. Specifically in the third quarter, we intentionally added store labor hours above our initial plans and incurred significant maintenance expenses related to the customer-facing areas of the store. These investments, along with the wage increases and the store structure changes implemented earlier this year, drove the majority of the 116 basis point deleverage in operating expenses. As the store experience is being addressed and efficiencies are created through new tools, technology and processes, we've begun calibrating labor hours against these improvements. Over time, as the productivity loop begins turning faster, we know we can create a strong balance between experience and profitability. We did benefit this quarter from the immaterial lease accounting cumulative adjustment that Claire mentioned in her earlier remarks. Which favorably impacted operating expenses by $74 million. As a result of our focus on improving customer experience, along with our ongoing investments in e-commerce, and somewhat offset by the lease accounting adjustment I just mentioned, operating income declined 8.6%. Excluding the impact from the lease adjustment, operating income declined approximately 10%. Moving on, in the third quarter, total inventory grew around 1% which was less than half the rate of sales. Inventory declined approximately 1.9% from comp stores as new processes in technology have reduced inventory across the store while simultaneously improving in stock levels. We are proud of the progress we've made this year on improving inventory levels across our network, but we have room to improve and we remain focused on these efforts. Finally, on the real estate side, we opened 15 Supercenters in the third quarter including relocations and expansions, and 35 traditional format neighborhood markets. We are working hard on improving both of these formats to ensure we have the best customer offering alongside strong operating efficiency. We'll continue to test ideas honing in on the best options for each of these formats. Shifting now to the fourth quarter, the holiday season is upon us. Our associates have been working hard all year to prepare. And we ready. We have the best value on great merchandise for the entire season without gimmicks. Our merchants have done a terrific job of listening to our customers on what they are looking for this season. We are excited about programs such as Chosen by Kids and our exclusive one hour guarantee event. This holiday, we're working to bring our customers an improved shopping experience. Whether they are in the store, online or using our mobile app. We know the holidays will be competitive. Additionally, we expect food inflation to remain low relative to last year, and will lap last year's significant drop in the fuel prices, which will make the comparison for the fourth quarter more difficult. But we're confident in our strategy and the actions we have taken, and believe they will help offset some of these pressures. Therefore, for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase of around 1% which would represent a 50 basis point improvement in our two-year comps stack from third quarter. Last year's fourth quarter comp was up 1.5% our strongest comp performance for fiscal 2015. And for last quarter an operating income growing faster than sales, both on a constant currency basis. Comp trends in Mexico and Canada continue to be strong which more than offset weaker performances in the U.K. Brazil and China. Where we continue to experience various competitive and economic challenges. Our markets remain focused on the strategic priorities discussed earlier this year, which include, actively managing the existing portfolio, delivery balanced growth, including e-commerce, being the lower cost operator, and building solid foundations in terms of talent, trust and technology. Let me touch on some of the progress we've made. We continue to take action this year to drive simplicity and focus in our portfolio. We sold a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner in Canada. And exited our Bank operations in Mexico. We are currently pursuing the sale of a portfolio shopping centers in Chile. And we are closing our business-to-business sales operations in the U.K. At the same time, we've looked for ways to enhance our portfolio in core markets which we've done by taking full ownership of Yihaodian in China, and acquiring 13 stores in 1 DC from a former competitor in Canada. We'll continue to review our portfolio to simplify our operations and help our teams stay focused on running great businesses. Our markets continue to invest heavily in price, quality and service aimed at driving comp sales. Our overall trend is improving, as seven of our eleven markets have now delivered positive comps for six straight quarters. We're delivering value and providing convenience that is attracting customers to our stores, clubs, websites and apps across our markets. I'm pleased with the innovation we're driving in e-commerce, led by online grocery, and I'm excited about the potential we have to access a broader customer segment. We continue to learn from our online grocery business in the U.K. as we test and roll out similar initiatives in Mexico and Canada and build a strong platform for growth in China. As Doug mentioned, the continued economic challenges in some of our major markets impacted on our overall global e-commerce sales growth this quarter. We still have work to do but I'm confident we're executing against this key strategic priority. Now let's discuss our overall results. In the third quarter, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 11.4%, impacted by an approximately $5 billion currency impact from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our reported results, so it's important to emphasize that our business on a constant currency basis is maintaining steady growth. We had strong positive comp sales in Mexico and Canada. The U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps, although the comps were slightly better in Q3 versus Q2. In each of our other markets, we had solid comps of at least 3%. Operating income grew faster than net sales at 8.5% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by excellent performance in Mexico and Canada. In addition, as Claire mentioned earlier, there was an immaterial lease accounting adjustment this quarter which favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $49 million on a constant currency basis. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 6.4%. On a constant currency basis inventory grew faster than net sales at 7%, primarily driven by our decision in Mexico to flow inventory through our import network early for the upcoming holiday season. On a reported basis inventory declined 10%. Now let's discuss market results, presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Let's begin with the U.K. Challenging competitive conditions persisted throughout the quarter as the market continues to experience rapid structural change. Customers have now benefited from more than 12 months of continually falling prices and the market has grown by less than 1% for six consecutive months. Despite a healthy overall economy, according to Cantar, the big four grocers continue to lose share to the discounters. U.K. net sales declined by 3.2% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 4.6%. Large store traffic and food remain the primary challenges, while online grocery continues to grow. The online business is focused on improving its core service offering and is performing above target on key internal performance metrics. Operating income increased, driven by reduced expenses as well as lapping some organizational restructuring costs from last year. The U.K. is focused on rebuilding momentum in this core business. Last month we launched Project Renewal, an 18-month project that reaffirms the direction set out in the five-year strategy but prioritizes investments more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores while putting non-core expansion, such as remote petrol stations, on hold. Greater focus on driving out inefficiencies across both buying and operations will enable the U.K. to build on its well-established value credentials and strengthen its competitive position. Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on October 27. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.4% with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%. Driven by solid comp growth in both self-service and Sam's Club. In self-service we achieved mid-single digit growth in groceries and high single digit growth in GM and apparel. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered a 220 basis point improvement in market share according to ANTAD. Sam's Club is maintaining a steady improvement in comps aided by ongoing events and campaigns to drive traffic and grow membership. We leveraged expenses in the quarter and grew operating income significantly faster than sales. Our e-commerce business in Mexico is growing in line with the market driven by strong growth in general merchandise. Under the Wal-Mart banner we're significantly expanding our assortment of ship-from-store items. We're rapidly growing store coverage for online grocery and customer orders are increasing. At Sam's Club we soft launched our new website while maintaining healthy growth with our existing platform. In Canada we continue to maintain solid growth and gain share in a competitive and low-growth environment. Net sales grew 5.7% and comps were up 4.3% driven by strong performance in the core grocery business as well as stronger performance in the GM business. In the quarter, Canada saw share gains in food, health and wellness, consumables and infants for the 12 weeks ended October the 29th according to Nielsen. In addition to strong top line performance, the team continues to focus on our low-cost operating model to drive a sustainable price advantage. Canada grew operating income faster than sales. We continue to invest in expanding customer access. We recently began a partnership with 7/11 and a piloting, grab-and-go lockers at some of the convenience stores in the greater Toronto area. We are pleased with the progress with our online grocery business has made since our pilot launched in July. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and I expect reliable growth to continue. In Brazil, the economic challenges are largely unchanged as high inflation and unemployment continue to impact consumer confidence and consumption levels. Net sales were down 0.4% and comps were down 0.6% driven by decline in hypermarket format mostly offset by strong sales growth in our wholesale business General merchandise primarily electronics accounted for the largest portion of the hypermarket sales decline. These economic challenges are impacting both our store and e-commerce sales. Operating income declined faster than sales due to increased labor claims, continued high utility costs, and higher markdown activity which helped us improve our inventory position going into the fourth quarter. Let's now shift to China, a key growth market. This quarter sales grew 2.9% driven by new store openings. Comp sales declined 0.7% in slower consumption growth. In the hypermarket channel, we gained share for an 11th consecutive quarter. We'll continue to invest in physical and digital to deliver a seamless shopping experience. We continue to drive efficiency in stores and at the home office. Operating income grew faster than net sales. We operate for less productivity initiatives remains a focus allowing reinvestment in labor and customer experience particularly in fresh. Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China is focused on further leveraging Wal-Mart's global and local assets. The business improved margins and balanced marketing spend and their intense competition on price. While I'm not satisfied with recent results, I'm confident in the actions we're taking in China that position us to achieve success for many years to come. Now let me recap. We had a good quarter with solid sales momentum in our underlying business driven by healthy comp sales in the majority of our markets. In addition, we delivered a relatively high level of constant currency operating profit. Our strategy remains focused and our priorities are clear and we're well-positioned for future growth. Now I will turn it to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz? Rosalind Brewer : Thanks, Dave. Today I'll share details about our third-quarter performance along with comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Members are at the center of the decisions we make and I'll talk about our ongoing efforts this year to deliver value for them. I'll also share with you specifics around our strategy, which is based on an in-depth review of the business that we've conducted this year. Before I get started, let me recognize Charles Redfield for his many contributions to Sam's Club over the last three years as our Chief Merchandising Officer. His passion for merchandising was experienced throughout the organization. We are excited for Charles as he takes on his new role as Head Merchant for Food in the Wal-Mart U.S. business. With Charles's transition, we are thrilled to have John Furner back at Sam's Club as our new Chief Merchandising Officer after having served as the Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer in China for nearly three years. Let's move on to a few specifics around our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. Comp sales for the third quarter were at the low end of our guidance. In key food categories we faced comparisons to last year's steep inflationary environment, and in our Wireless business we continued to experience headwinds from changing industry dynamics. We saw positive results in areas of the business that introduced more newness such as Health and Wellness and Consumables. Net sales grew 1.6% as comp sales increased 0.4%. Slide 10 provides the components of our comp increase. Ticket grew 70 basis points during the period. Positive momentum in traffic from savings members continued, but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results. Our gross profit rate increased 46 basis points from last year due to a disciplined focus on product acquisition costs, a favorable mix and logistics benefits. Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter as we continued to invest in people and technology. We are confident that these are the right choices to make for our business and the benefits of these investments will help us deliver sustainable growth over time. Earlier you heard Claire talk about an immaterial item related to the company's accounting for certain leases, which resulted in a benefit to operating expenses of approximately $27 million for Sam's Club. We were pleased with the growth in membership income during the quarter, which increased 5.4%. Investments in the cash rewards program for Plus members resulted in improved Plus renewal rates and Plus penetration is at an all-time high. The impact of social media campaigns was also a contributing factor. Turning to our merchandising categories, let me talk about a few areas that had the most impact during the quarter. Please see slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories. Our Fresh, Freezer, Cooler business faced significant headwinds as deflation in key areas, including fresh meat and dairy weighed on our comps. We were pleased with our performance in produce. Technology and Entertainment was pressured during the period, led by a decline in Wireless. The industry shift to installment plans continued to negatively impact the category. In Electronics, Imaging and Audio performed well and we continued our efforts to refine the assortment. Health and wellness and Consumables benefited from innovation and newness. In Pharmacy, the free $4/$10 prescription program continued to drive growth in script count. New items in OTC led to a solid performance in the quarter and products like protein powder drove good results, further supporting our initiatives around Healthy For You. Our Consumables business benefited as several new items were launched and we continued to gain share in Tabletop as the focus on private brands and quality resonated with members. In e-commerce we continued to make progress with integrating digital efforts to transform how members shop and interact with our clubs. Business members have enjoyed the convenience of pre-ordering merchandise for pickup at the club for more than a decade. Now, through advances in technology along with innovation from the e-commerce team, all of our members can enjoy similar access with an improved digital experience. This year's rollout of club pickup to all of our clubs has been well received and represents the fastest-growing area of our business. Sales in the space increased to 50% during third quarter. We have also added features along the way. During the quarter, we completed the implementation of mobile check-in capability to provide members with a better experience and shorter wait times. We introduced yield sensing technology that alerts our associates when members drive onto the parking lot. We extended drive-through or curb-side options to more clubs, and members love the convenience. These new features build on earlier advances in club pickup, including easier reorder and a prepaid option. Now let me move on to guidance for the fourth quarter. As we move into the quarter we will face last year's inflationary environment and a tough comparison. As a result, we believe comp sales without fuel for the 13 week period ending January 29, 2016, will be flat to up 1%. Members are at the center of the decisions we make. We've worked diligently this year to deliver on what we know they want. They expect offerings that are relevant and convenient. They want excitement and newness. They want a seamless shopping experience that integrates the best of digital and physical. We see success where we are delivering on these expectations. For example, you've heard us talk about the expansion of organics in our assortment. Members ask for an improved selection, and we are delivering. Over the summer we launched shocking values online, which has helped to instill a treasure hunt mentality with members. And the innovative free $4/$10 prescription program is providing real savings to plus members and helping to lift the overall health and wellness category. I am pleased with the steps we've been taking throughout this year to deliver for members. We know we must do more with member relevant merchandise and new member growth. Today, I'm excited to share with you the plans we've developed as we look ahead. We have been focused on developing a strategy at Sam's Club that will deliver our business into the future and build long-term sustainable growth. The four key elements of our strategy include, growth through higher household income members in high-value business segments. Relevant merchandise and increase value for our members. Acquiring and retaining the right members and increasing the spend. And lastly, integrating digital to transform the club experience. In order to better align the businesses as we move forward, we made organizational changes and enhancements. John Furner is returning to Sam's Club as Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. John has rejoined the team after nearly three years of Chief Merchandising and Chief Marketing Officer of Wal-Mart China. Where he led merchandising, procurement, marketing supply chain, financial services and mobile commerce for the hyper-market division. Prior to moving overseas, John was Senior Vice President of Home and Apparel Merchandise in Global Sourcing for Sam's Club. In addition, we've reallocated resources pertaining to merchandising, and have created new positions in critical areas including data and analytics, fresh food, regional buying and proprietary brands. We also created a new leadership position dedicated to business member merchandising. Moving forward, we will continue to serve both savings and business members. We have clarity around the categories of members we will target. Data will drive our decisions, and we are confident we are focused on the right opportunities. As I close let me summarize today's thoughts. As we look back at the third quarter we acknowledge that we need to improve our sales. Where we introduce new merchandise, we deliver strong results. We continue to make strategic investments in people and technology as these are critical enablers of our strategy. We are also pleased with our efforts to further integrate digital and physical retail. Our members are at the center of all of our decisions. We are making progress across the club and through online and mobile commerce capabilities to deliver value for them. Whether it's saving them time with club pickup or saving them money on their prescriptions with free $4/$10 we continue to find new ways to innovate. And we are confident the strategy and enhancement to our organizational structure will propel her business into the future. Now, I will turn the call over to Charles. Charles? Charles Holley : Thanks, Roz. I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced at Wal-Mart U.S. as well as in our international business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Wal-Mart U.S. stores and a fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales indicate that we are taking the right steps to win with customers, grow sales and deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. From in e-commerce standpoint we have long-term plans in place to grow our business. We are making progress on several of our key initiatives and recognize we have more work to do. As expected, the investments we are making in people and technology impacted both operating expenses and profits in the quarter. However, we delivered earnings per share well within our guidance and remain confident that these investments will better position Wal-Mart for the future. Now let's turn our attention to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full-year. Last quarter we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share to range between $4.40 and $4.70. Today we are narrowing our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range between $4.50 and $4.65 including a range of $1.40 and $1.55 for the fourth quarter. These ranges include the assumptions we provided in the second quarter which consists of the impact of our investments in wages, training and additional labor hours in our stores, the incremental investment in global e-commerce and the headwinds in the U.S. from pharmacy margins and shrink. Currency remains a significant headwind for us. As I indicated at our analyst meeting last month we expect our total net sales growth to be relatively flat for fiscal year 2016. It's important to note that if we were to exclude the impact of currency our total net sales growth would be around 3% for the year. Now, assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full-year impact to earnings-per-share to be approximately $0.16 up $0.01 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.15. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 31% and 33% for the full year. As we've indicated in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year. Now as I've mentioned at our analyst meeting last month, we are monitoring progress in congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2014. If the legislation is passed we'll end up closer to the lower end of the updated range that we provided. As I mentioned at the October analyst meeting, we will continue to review our portfolio including stores and clubs. As in prior years, we may have charges related to closing businesses or stores and clubs. These charges would not be included in our guidance. This is my last call as the Chief Financial Officer as I will be retiring effective January 31. I feel fortunate to be a small part of the Wal-Mart story. I've enjoyed working with all of you over the past few years. Brett Biggs will take over as the Chief Financial Officer for Wal-Mart effective January 1. You're in very capable hands and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Brett will be leading in the future. With that, thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company, and on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season.

Now, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug? C. Douglas McMillon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fourth quarter earnings, year-end results and progress against our strategy. We had a solid fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.49. It's important to note our numbers reflect some discrete items this quarter, including the impact of store closures and certain tax items. And Brett will share more details in a minute. For fiscal year 2016, adjusted EPS was $4.59. And excluding the $17.2 billion impact of currency, we delivered revenue of $499.4 billion, up 2.8%, which is $13.7 billion of growth. We continue to be pleased with the fundamental trends. We're making progress with customers and associates and feel good about where we're heading. We're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening our digital relationships with customers as we work to become the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We'll save our customers not only money but time, and shopping with us will be simple, convenient and fun. I also want to call out our continued commitment to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we were able to return $4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, today we announced a dividend increase. Our annual dividend was $1.96 and we've increased it to $2 per share. This is the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Walmart. Overall, this past year has been a year of investment, operational improvement and change, even while we delivered solid growth. We do see an underlying strength in our Walmart U.S. business that wasn't there a year ago. I want to share a few highlights. As you know, our biggest investments have been in people and technology. On this call one year ago, we announced our investment in higher wages, better training and more department managers to make Walmart U.S. a better place to work and shop. We can only be successful with customers with engaged and empowered associates. A few weeks ago, we announced the second part of the wage increase. And it's awesome to give a raise to more than 1 million people on the same day. We also announced a simplified paid time-off policy that will mean no waiting for associates to use their time off. These and other changes in the business are making a difference. Our customer satisfaction scores have risen significantly this year and we now have had six consecutive quarters of positive comps and five straight quarters of positive traffic at Walmart U.S. In the technology and e-commerce space, we continued to innovate with a focus on the customer. We have developed a new platform that we can scale across the business. We have improved our fulfillment capabilities with new fulfillment centers that are helping us get orders to customers' doors faster and more efficiently. And we continued to see growth in store pickup for online orders. We also expanded online grocery shopping to over 150 locations across more than 20 markets in the U.S. Customers are ordering online and on their phones and then picking up their groceries on our parking lots without ever leaving their cars. Customer satisfaction for those who use our free pickup service is in the high 90s. We are learning some interesting things along the way. We've found that 8 :00 p.m. to 9 :00 p.m. is one of the most popular times customers order groceries online, usually once the kids go to bed. We also see a healthy number of orders in the middle of the night. These may be parents comforting or feeding infants and ordering more diapers or formula to pick up the next day. While it's been awhile since my kids were that age, I remember those days well. And I absolutely love that we're able to offer convenience and blend into our customers' lives when they need us most. I'm also excited about the introduction of Walmart Pay. And I was very proud of how different parts of our company worked together on it with a relentless focus on the customer experience. I look forward to us rolling it out this coming year. We recently aligned our technology teams because we want more speed and more customer-centric and cost-efficient innovations like this one. We will deliver one Walmart experience to our customers. Additionally, we took steps this quarter to sharpen the focus of our portfolio. As part of this continuing portfolio review process, we looked at all of our stores from both a financial and strategic standpoint. One of the key takeaways for me was how strong our portfolio really is, in that we only closed stores representing less than 1% of our global revenue and square footage. I'm pleased, but not surprised, that we have already found open positions for more than half of the impacted associates in the U.S., and we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations. So we're doing what we said we'd do, and we're on the right path. Still, we know we have a lot more work to do. And there are areas of the business that are not where they need to be. Let's look more closely at each of the segments. Walmart U.S. is on firm ground. We had comp sales of 0.6% on top of last year's 1.5% comp for the fourth quarter. As we lapped positive comps, we accelerated on a two-year stack basis. We also had continued strong performance from Neighborhood Markets. In addition to our investments in our associates, we're getting better at the fundamentals of retail and managing the business better. We are reducing comp store inventory and improving our in-stock performance. We also had a sound plan for the holiday season that ensured customers could rely on us for low prices throughout the season, not just at big moments. Walmart International again delivered solid financial performance. Nine of our 11 markets delivered positive comps for the quarter, and I'm very encouraged by the results overall. Walmex, in particular, is in a good groove again. And Canada delivered strong performance. Although we face near-term headwinds with the economy in China, our business there is on track. Brazil, however, is proving to be an increasingly challenging economic environment, and the competitive intensity in the UK continues to increase. As we review and act on our portfolio, we also announced that we were exploring selling both our clothing chain, called Suburbia, in Mexico and a property company in Chile. Our International business is healthy and growing. Global eCommerce sales and Gross Merchandise Value, or GMV, globally grew approximately 8% in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. The holiday season gave a good preview of how all the pieces we're putting in place will come together. We saw strong online sales in the U.S. on the big days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, and nearly half of our customers bought their online orders on a mobile device. We also saw growth in store pickup and online grocery. We have faced specific challenges in our largest e-commerce markets outside the U.S. Economic softness in Brazil and China continued to weigh on growth and we have been in a transition phase at Yihaodian since acquiring full ownership. As mentioned before, the environment in the UK remains extremely competitive and it's important to remember our e-commerce business in UK is a food delivery and pickup business. In the U.S., we plan to build on the foundation we've built by delivering a significant assortment expansion and faster delivery at a lower cost this year. We need more GMV growth from our e-commerce businesses. Sam's Club is in the early days with its new strategy. Comps for the quarter were below what we anticipated. And Food, in particular, underperformed outside of the holiday periods. We're pleased with the work so far to address the fundamentals of the business, to improve merchandising and drive new membership, but we have more to do. There are encouraging signs in our membership numbers. As we address issues with the core business, we're excited by growth in new areas. For example, Club Pickup continued to be the fastest-growing part of the business. Finally, even as we focus on our customers and our associates, we were reminded a few weeks ago about the opportunity we have to lead in our communities. Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, and PepsiCo announced we will collectively donate water to meet the daily needs of over 10,000 school children in Flint, Michigan, for the balance of the calendar year. Whether it's hiring veterans, supporting U.S. manufacturing, or driving new renewable energy production, we have strengths that can help others in important ways. During the first quarter, we will release our annual Global Responsibility Report, alongside our Annual Report, to share more on how we're making a difference. Leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the world, and we will continue to move the needle this year. In summary, we continue to believe we are putting the right foundation in place to better serve customers, deliver stronger sales growth and ultimately strengthen bottom line performance. As we begin this new year, I'm focused on continuing the momentum in our U.S. stores, getting all the ingredients in place for stronger growth in e-commerce and the strategic choices related to how we put them together. I'm also mindful of the need for balance. Improving productivity as we grow is important. Brett will talk through our full-year forecast, with the first quarter being the most pressured from an earnings point of view due to the timing of the incremental wage investments. This will be another year where we digest foundational investments, and it's important that we build on what we've started as we go through the year. Now, I'll turn it over to Greg. Gregory S. Foran - President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S.: Thank you, Doug. Over the last 12 months, we've laid out our plan to win in the U.S. now and in the future. We are executing against it and have taken several steps towards delivering on our commitment of growing the top line, increasing market share and delivering shareholder value. We've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm pleased that our fourth quarter results demonstrated solid progress against this plan. Across the key metrics we track to measure our progress, we're right where we expected to be. Comp sales were positive for the sixth straight quarter and driven by our fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. Our customers are increasingly pleased with the changes in our stores. And they're letting us and others know through improvements in the Net Promoter Score and improved customer experience feedback. In fact, at the end of this fiscal year, more than 75% of stores had met or exceeded their customer experience goals set back at the beginning of the year. This was a significant improvement over the 16% that were meeting this mark at the beginning of the fiscal year. Additionally, our associates are more engaged, and turnover is lower. Department managers have been hired in key areas of the stores, and our new training programs are underway. New technology is in our associates' hands, and better processes are creating efficiencies in the stores, driving higher in-stocks and a continuing decline in comp store inventory. As we have discussed, there will be more investments necessary to further deliver on our plan, but we have remained on task and we're seeing progress. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to address two announcements we've made recently. First, we announced the second phase of our two-year, $2.7 billion investment in our associates. Just two days from now, on February the 20th, we'll raise the starting wage to at least $10 per hour for hourly associates hired before January 1, 2016. Additionally, we're continuing to simplify our business and enhance our benefits package by shifting to a paid time-off policy for all associates. These changes, along with our previous announcements around training programs and store structure, are exciting for all our associates. We are providing our people with a ladder of opportunity to build a career with Walmart and to provide great service to our customers. Secondly, in January, we announced the closing of 150 U.S. stores, including all 102 of our Express format locations. Closing stores is never an easy decision, but it's necessary to ensure we are positioned to deliver our long-term plan. Strengthening the Supercenter and Neighborhood Market formats, while simultaneously delivering a seamless experience with e-commerce, will require our full attention. In fact, we expect to open more than 135 stores in fiscal 2017 alone. While we know that closing stores affected a number of our associates, I'm proud to say that more than half of these associates have already received offers or have been placed in open roles in nearby stores. And we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations. Due to the financial impact of the store closures, our reported results differ significantly from the adjusted results and the underlying business performance. As reported, we incurred $729 million in charges related to these store closures. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude the impact of store closures for purposes of comparability. For reported results including the impact of store closures and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. Moving to our fourth quarter results, net sales grew $1.9 billion, or 2.4%, and comp store sales were up 0.6%. We're pleased with the continued growth in customer traffic, which improved 0.7% this quarter on top of last year's 1.4% traffic gain. On a two-year stack basis, our fourth quarter comp sales improved to 2.1%. While customers benefited from lower gas prices, we experienced significant headwinds from deflation in meat and dairy products. Additional sales pressure came from warmer than normal temperatures early in the quarter and delays in IRS tax refund checks impacted the very end of the quarter. Neil will cover our e-commerce initiatives in more detail in this call, but for this quarter, e-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp. Overall, we were pleased with our performance over the six-week holiday season. We made a strategic decision to sensibly pull back on short-term, deep price investments as we looked to simplify the experience for both our customers and associates, and shift back towards a more EDLP focus. Investments in e-commerce fulfillment centers allowed us to extend the shipping cut-off date. And customers took full advantage of Pickup, ordering their gifts online and conveniently picking them up alongside their grocery trips. As we approached the end of the season, customers transitioned from online to in-store, and we delivered, driving strong performance across the box as customers stocked up on last-minute gifts and food for their holiday meals. The Supercenter format delivered its sixth straight positive comp in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets continued their strong performance, delivering a 7% comp. We're seeing steady progress in our efforts to improve each of these formats, with a focus on fresh offerings, clean stores, fast check-outs, friendly associates and better in-stocks. We're pleased with our progress in Grocery, which saw a positive comp this quarter, led by improvement in Consumables. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced substantial deflation in both meat and dairy, which resulted in slight deflation across all of Food. We estimate this deflation negatively impacted our segment comp by approximately 100 basis points, relative to last year's comp. Our Grocery business delivered positive comp traffic growth, even while lapping positive comp traffic from last year. We continue to push forward with our Win in Fresh initiatives, including testing new layouts, reducing inventory while improving in-stocks in both Food and Consumables, and exceeding expectations in our urgent agenda items such as reducing waste and throwaways. We still have work to do in our Fresh area, and many things we want to accomplish in the upcoming year, but we remain on track. In our General Merchandise areas, Apparel improved throughout the quarter, after a slow start due to warmer-than-usual temperatures. On-trend assortments, particularly in active wear, drove results in this area. In Entertainment, we continued to experience soft wireless sales and a slower adoption of new technology in televisions. We're continuing to make progress in this space by focusing on our operating model, including service to our customers, assortment and department layout, but it will take time to get it right. Across the rest of the General Merchandise and Home categories, solid performance came from better in-stocks, assortment updates and new products. Finally, Health & Wellness remained a positive comp driver for us, with growth coming from branded drug inflation and better in-stocks in OTC. However, a slower flu season created a headwind to our Cold, Cough and Flu business this quarter. Moving to the remainder of our financials, gross margin was up 69 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in Food, General Merchandise and Consumables. This was somewhat offset by declines in Health & Wellness, although we're still focused on providing better visibility and tools to help combat ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures. Transportation costs were helped by lower fuel rates. Additionally, our intentional pullback on deep price investments during the holiday season meaningfully improved margins in Entertainment. Lastly, we made additional progress on our urgent agent items, focused on reducing costs both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise, and remained diligent on improving processes related to shrink. As expected, expenses increased 129 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by our investments in associates and stores, including transitioning to a new paid time-off policy, along with building out our e-commerce capabilities. However, we did a better job of aligning store labor hours with customer traffic by leveraging efficiencies gained from new processes and technology. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the improvements in gross margin, which resulted in an operating income decline of 5.3%. We continued to make progress in managing inventory. Overall inventory grew 0.9%, or approximately 25% the rate of total sales growth. Comp store inventory declined 2.9%, as we remained focused on cleaning out our back rooms and using processes such as CAP and top-stock to ensure better in-stocks for our customers. Inventory will remain a key focus area for us in this new fiscal year. Fiscal 2016 has been a year of redefinition, redefining our goals, redefining our focus and redefining our future. We've been intentional in our design and in our actions, and these actions have resulted in steady progress. To recap our performance for the year, net sales increased by $10.3 billion, or 3.6%. Comp store sales grew 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% growth in comp traffic. E-commerce contributed approximately 25 basis points to our comp performance. Gross margin improved 14 basis points for the year, helped by our ongoing focus on urgent agenda items and lower transportation costs, partially offset by headwinds from shrink and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. However, the investments in our associates, stores and e-commerce drove expenses up 8.3% versus last year, which resulted in an operating income decline of 7.1%. We opened 69 Supercenters this year, including relocations and conversions, and 146 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets. In FY 2017, we expect to open 50 to 60 Supercenters, including relocations and conversions. We'll also open 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets. Additionally, we plan to further expand our online grocery program to more markets this year. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to growth, but we'll do it sensibly, with the customer in mind as we select the right locations, products and service offerings for each store. We know the decisions we've made this year to improve our business pressured the bottom line, but we're confident they were in the best interest of our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We believe in our long-term plan. And we remain on track to achieve these goals. In the new fiscal year, we're continuing to march down the path we've laid out. Our initiatives across the box are gaining steam. And we'll look forward to drive improvements in assortment and pricing, while focusing on building a seamless shopping experience across all channels. We've just held our annual Year Beginning Meeting in Indianapolis, with nearly 7,000 of our operations and merchandising associates. I told the team that I was proud of their hard work and progress last year, and this year, we would build upon that as we work to execute with excellence. In fact, we have raised the bar higher with new annual goals in our stores to drive an even cleaner, faster and friendlier customer experience as the year goes on. We expect these efforts, along with the ongoing investments in our stores and our associates, to drive continued growth in the top line. Lower fuel prices will also provide some tailwinds. However, food deflation, which has accelerated in the last six weeks, will remain a challenge. Given these factors, for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2016, we expected a comp sales increase of around 50 basis points. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 1, 2015, increased 1.1%. As a reminder, the investments in our associates will be an expense headwind this year, most significantly in the first quarter, as we implement phase two of these investments prior to lapping last year's phase one implementation, which started in April. However, we will continue to focus on lowering costs through better buying and operating a better business. Now, I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave? David Cheesewright - President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Greg. I'm pleased with our progress this quarter in a challenging global economy. We're delivering our strategy, seeing comp sales improve, and bringing in profit ahead of our expectations. Whilst our performance was driven by Walmex and Canada, our results reflect broad achievement. Nine of our 11 markets had positive comps this quarter and seven of our markets have now maintained positive comps for at least seven quarters in a row. We continue to see headwinds in the UK, China and Brazil, which I'll discuss more in a moment. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, which are to : actively manage the existing portfolio; deliver balanced growth; be the lowest cost operator; and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology. In terms of the portfolio, we announced the closure of 115 small, underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets. Whilst these are difficult decisions for our markets and associates, it better positions us for growth in the right formats and geographies. Recently, we also announced that we're pursuing the sale of our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico and we're in the process of selling our shopping centers in Chile. These are successful businesses, but aren't a core part of our portfolio strategy. These changes would help drive greater simplicity to our operations and an increased focus on our strategic priorities. For balanced growth, I'm pleased with our comp trends and look forward to opening between 200 and 240 stores this year across our portfolio, while at the same time expanding our reach in e-commerce. Our lowest cost operator initiative is focused on two key areas, cost of goods sold and overhead reductions. On cost of goods sold, we started a cost analytics program that provides improved tools and cost visibility to our merchants, which enables them to lead fact-based negotiations with suppliers. We're pleased with early results from this program in Canada and the UK and will expand the program to additional markets later this year. Now, let's discuss our overall results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than last quarter. Reported net sales declined 9.7%, impacted by a $4.7 billion currency headwind from continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned, we had a strong quarter for comp sales. In our five largest markets, Mexico, Canada and Brazil reported positive comps, while the UK and China reported negative comps. All other markets had solid positive comp sales. Operating income declined 7.8% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by $215 million in charges, $153 million on a reported basis, related to previously-announced store closures. Excluding this and certain other charges this year, such as restructuring costs, as well as last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 19%. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 4.2%. This increase was driven primarily by China, where inventory increased in preparation for Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.2%. For the full year, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis, with improved comp sales on top of 3.6% growth last year. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a significant impact of $17.1 billion on our reported results, by far the largest one year impact in our history, resulting in a net sales decline of 9.4% on a reported basis. Full year operating income declined 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by store closures this quarter. Excluding this and last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 13.4%. Now, let's discuss fourth quarter results for our largest markets, presented on a constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Let's start with Mexico, which was the biggest driver of this quarter's results. Walmex released its earnings on February 16 under IFRS, while results here are under U.S. GAAP, so some numbers may differ. Walmex net sales increased 9.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico net sales grew 9.7% and comp sales increased 8.6%, driven by increased customer spending and solid execution from our stores. Self-service was particularly strong, with comp sales of 8.8%, while the rest of the market, according to ANTAD, grew only 4.9%. Sam's Club also had its best performance of the year, delivering comp sales of 7%, driven by strong sales from Advantage, or non-business, members. Operating income declined versus last year, driven by a planned reduction in our gross profit rate. Let's next discuss Canada, which had another strong sales quarter. Net sales grew 5.8%, benefiting by strong customer traffic as a result of our improved Fresh offer, continued price investments and improvement in operational standards. Comp sales were 4.3%, our seventh consecutive quarter in positive territory. I'm especially pleased with our sales in Canada, given the economic pressures in the oil-producing provinces. We had positive market share gains in Food, Consumables and Health & Wellness, for the 12 weeks ended January 23, according to Nielsen. Our online sales continue to grow and perform well. Operating income was down versus last year, due to certain land impairments and pre-opening expenses for 13 previously-announced stores acquired from a former competitor. Excluding these impacts, operating income would've been positive. Let's talk now about the UK, which continues to face challenging market conditions. Grocery market sales fell 0.2% in the 12 weeks ended January 3, according to Kantar. This was driven by price deflation of 1.8% as a result of intense competition, and was the 17th consecutive period with deflation. The big four grocers remained under pressure as discounters continue to grow and gain share. In the UK, we're striking a balance between investment in the customer offer, profit and cash flow. Overall, net sales declined 4.4%, and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.5%, driven by declines in our large store format and in our Food business, partially offset by continued growth in online grocery. We decided not to participate in Black Friday discounting, which impacted our comp sales, but helped profitability and allowed greater focus on operational standards and the customer offer in the core Food business. We delivered strong cash performance as a result of disciplined management of CapEx and working capital. Asda is focused on repositioning its business through Project Renewal, which will simplify operations, lead to substantial reduction in costs and allow for significant investments in customer value. As part of this project, we're deploying a new cost analytics program to aid with buying. We're also joining EMD, a European buying alliance, and we recently completed the purchase of two meat processing businesses. These actions will help increase buying efficiencies and remove costs from the supply chain, particularly for private label products. The UK has also completed a restructuring of its home office aimed at increasing focus and improving operational agility. In addition, the UK will invest an additional \u00a3500 million in price during the period of its five-year strategy, on top of the \u00a31 billion previously committed. We're taking aggressive actions and we're focused on repositioning our offering to meet the changing needs of our customers. In China, despite ongoing economic challenges and slower GDP growth, we continue to gain share for the 12th consecutive quarter in the hypermarket channel, according to Nielsen. Net sales grew 0.3%, driven by new store openings and improved performance from completed remodels. Comp sales fell 3%, in part, due to warmer weather and disappointing sales in winter seasonal categories. We continue to make progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China. We're benefiting from our earlier actions to centralize our buying offices and build out our supply chain. We've improved our gross margin rate and have realized benefits from productivity initiatives, while investing in labor and customer experience. We can see momentum building as performance in Fresh has improved in recent quarters in both sales and margin. Operating income continues to grow faster than sales. The team in China is focused on delivering a trusted shopping experience through both physical and digital channels. We're starting to see the benefits from tighter collaboration with Yihaodian. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Walmart now leverages Yihaodian's last mile network for online orders, which has led to greater delivery capacity. Overall, we're excited about the actions we're taking in China that are setting us up for long-term growth. In Brazil, we continue to face political and economic instability. The deterioration in the macro environment, combined with persistent high inflation, continues to put a strain on customers. Net sales grew 1.2% and comps grew 0.8%, in a retail market that contracted by 5.7%, according to Serasa Experian. We were encouraged by another quarter of double digit growth in our wholesale business, mostly offset by continued softness in the hypermarket format. Operating income was down versus last year, driven by the cost to close the 60 stores announced earlier. Excluding store closure costs, operating income would have been relatively flat to last year. We're seeing positive results from some of our transformation initiatives, such as repositioning the customer proposition in our wholesale business, but there's still work to be done. Brazil's focus for the year ahead will be to finalize store closures, revise and reposition the customer proposition for our hypermarket format, and complete the integration of systems and processes in our stores. We are committed to turnaround efforts in this important market. As I wrap up, I'd like to recognize the efforts of our dedicated international associates operating in 28 countries around the globe that helped us achieve consistently good results throughout the year. I'm confident in the management teams we have leading our markets and the strategic priorities we have in place to drive further growth in the year ahead. Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz? Rosalind Gates Brewer - President & Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. I'll start today's call with details around our fourth quarter performance. I will also provide an update on how we have begun to execute against the strategy that I detailed during our third quarter earnings call. At Sam's Club, we remain laser-focused on our members. Through investments we've made and will continue to make in people and technology, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across our app, our site and our clubs. Let's begin by talking about our fourth quarter results. It's important to note that our reported results were negatively impacted by certain charges totaling approximately $77 million. This amount includes a charge of approximately $57 million resulting from our decision to close underperforming clubs. The remainder of the charges includes a policy change related to paid time-off as well as severance and other costs associated with recently-announced organizational enhancements. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. Comp sales for the fourth quarter were below our expectations. Severe winter storms significantly disrupted approximately 200 clubs toward the end of the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact to the comp of approximately 30 basis points. That said, we know that our core comp performance can improve, and it will. The work we have underway, which I'll talk about in just a bit, is designed, in part, to improve the fundamentals of our business, specifically membership and merchandising. Broadly speaking, trends that we saw throughout the year were again prevalent during the quarter. Among the most notable items were : softness in Food, primarily as a result of a minimal level of inflation or, in some instances, deflation in key categories; an impact to Grocery as we began to evolve the assortment; and challenges in the Technology and Entertainment area from a deliberate transition in space reallocation along with pressures in wireless. Yet, we know that where we have seen innovation in the assortment and in service offerings, we have seen success. I'll talk more about our merchandise categories in a moment. Net sales decreased 0.1%, as comp sales declined 0.5%. Slide 10 of the financial presentation provides the components of our comp sales. We were pleased with the performance of our Savings members, as positive momentum in traffic continued, but softness from our Business members negatively impacted our results. Gross profit rate decreased four basis points from last year. We continue to invest in membership value through price and our Cash Rewards program. Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter. As expected, investments in people and technology pressured our expenses. Additionally, charges for the items I mentioned earlier impacted Q4. Excluding these items, operating expense as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat compared with last year. Membership income increased 5.6% during Q4. Plus renewals increased 35% over last year. And we continued to see a favorable trend of renewal rates for Plus members. The value of a Sam's Club membership is clear. Our targeted marketing programs resulted in new membership acquisitions that accelerated each of the last three quarters versus last year. Let's turn now to our merchandising categories. I'll provide details on areas that were materially impactful to the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories. In Fresh/Freezer/Cooler, deflationary trends continued, particularly in fresh meat and dairy. We saw positive results in produce, yet headwinds from the remainder of the category proved too much to overcome. Dry Grocery and areas of Fresh experienced pressures from deflation. As we continue to expand our private brand, generate more newness and reallocate space, these areas are gaining member acceptance, but take careful handling and coordination. Technology, Entertainment, Office had some bright spots with new items in TVs and wearables, both of which perform well online and in clubs. Wireless installment plans continue to place pressure on the category. When we innovate, we see good results. In Health & Wellness and Consumables, our Free/4/10 (46:47) Plus benefit program in Pharmacy is helping to lift the total category. Services are important to our members, and they reward us when we deliver in this space. The technology services company, IMS Health, measures our market share of the five free scripts in the program. According to IMS, we grew share by 11 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2015, and our share is nearly 25 basis points higher than it was prior to the launch of the program. Free/4/10 (47:20) was also a strong contributor to membership upgrades to Plus since the beginning of the fiscal year. Moving on to e-commerce, this year, we made the decision to push many of our holiday events online, and we were pleased with response from our members. Our Holiday Savings Celebration on November 14 drove good results, and we were pleased with other events, including Cyber Monday. During the quarter, traffic to our site increased by 7% versus the prior year, and the conversion improved by 18%. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in our pure e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities. We're also excited about the integration of our digital and physical offerings. During Q4, Club Pickup increased 46% over last year, and it now represents the fastest-growing piece of our business. Members want to shop with Sam's Club how and where they choose, and we are building the infrastructure across multiple channels to deliver that experience. On our call from Q3, I talked about a new strategy. During Q4, we began to execute against that strategy in important ways, including: additional organizational enhancements that will better align talent with critical needs; portfolio management through the closure of underperforming clubs; an extensive review of merchandise categories; and the expansion of private label brands in key areas. These are only a few examples, and we have many other work streams underway. The totality of these efforts will address the fundamentals of our business, including membership and merchandising, as well as deliver new services and offerings. As I think about guidance for the first quarter, I'm reminded that, although we have accomplished a great deal over the previous months, it remains early days in our transformation. As a result, comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2016, are expected to be around flat. Let me close today with a few thoughts. First, the new alignment of our organization will position the business to better serve our members. It was a significant step in our transformation, and we will begin to see the benefits in the coming quarter. Secondly, our new Chief Merchandising Officer has conducted a comprehensive review of our merchandise based on identified markets and what he has gleaned from our strategy work. We are excited about his early insights at this stage. I'm confident we're taking the business in the right direction now and for the future. Through a disciplined, refined approach to growth, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across app, site and club. Now, I'll turn the call over to Neil. Neil? Neil M. Ashe - President & Chief Executive Officer, Global eCommerce and Technology : Thanks, Roz. I want to pick up on Doug's comments about our opportunity to be the first to offer a seamless shopping experience at a scale that only Walmart can deliver. E-commerce at Walmart is about bringing together all of the pieces to help customers buy the items they want at Walmart prices, however and wherever they want. Our customers look at us as one Walmart, one easy experience across our app, site and store or club. In a short span, we've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We have rolled out a new technology platform and we have dramatically increased our physical distribution network. And, in just the past six months, we've grown to serve over 20 markets with online grocery. During the fourth quarter, we started to get a glimpse into how these capabilities we put into place are starting to come together to deliver the seamless customer experience. Looking forward, we're focused on three big opportunities : continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers; scaling our online assortment; and expanding online grocery. For the quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV both grew at 8%. For the full year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. As we discussed in October, growth continues to be pressured by weakness in Brazil, China and the UK, due to macroeconomic and competitive challenges. In China, we have rebuilt the Yihaodian leadership team since taking full ownership, and they continue to build on the strengths of their mobile engagement with customers and increasing business through imported products. There is work to do there, but we are taking actions to improve the business and accelerate growth in one of our key markets. In Brazil, the team has been working to balance growth and profitability during an economically challenging period that we expect to continue throughout the fiscal year. In the U.S., we continue to grow the business and created a more seamless experience for our customers across our app, our site and our store. Looking more closely at holiday in the U.S., Walmart.com saw strong sales on the big days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. What was most exciting was how our new capabilities started to deliver seamless shopping for customers. As customers shopped on Walmart.com, our new platform was powering the front and back-end shopping experience for the first time during holiday. Despite the complexity of a complete platform rebuild, Pangaea handled the intense holiday volume. Customers could order gifts even closer to Christmas this year and they saw our best on-time delivery rates ever, thanks to our new fulfillment centers. While the FCs opened just a few months before holiday, they lived up to our targets for efficiency and productivity. They showed that they can scale with our business and combine with our stores, DCs and transportation network to deliver speed, efficiency and better experiences for customers. Customers could also get their online orders the same day in stores, and we saw nearly a 40% jump in store pickup during holidays. We were also able to blend our online and stores to serve customers how and where they were shopping. One great example was on the morning of Black Friday, when we saw a smart TV sell out online within 20 minutes. We had another TV from that supplier available in stores, so we dialed up the promotion on Walmart.com and made it available for store pickup. The item quickly sold out in stores. To customers, it was a seamless access to a gift they wanted. It was a great example of the power of combining online with stores in close proximity to customers. Customers were also using our app to shop seamlessly across online and stores. We offered early access to the Black Friday circular on the mobile app for the first time, and the app jumped to the number one spot in the Apple App Store that day. Customers also showed that they are now comfortable buying on their phone. This year, more than half of online sales were on a mobile device on Thanksgiving, which was double last year. We saw significant growth in mobile sales for the rest of the peak holiday period. With our app, customers were also able to create wish lists, check-in for store pickup and pick up item locations in stores. We continued to build on that app experience in the quarter with another powerful tool, Walmart Pay. We started testing it in a small group of stores and the initial feedback from customers reinforced that the experience was simple and easy. Walmart Pay is the perfect example of how our app gives customers a seamless experience that merges digital and physical to make shopping faster and easier, and it gives customers a reason to form a digital relationship with Walmart. It was also a great example of how our teams aligned to deliver these experiences in just a few months. At Samsclub.com, we started the holidays with a big kickoff event on November 14, which delivered a triple digit comp for the day. We also saw strong comps and record sales on the biggest days of the holiday season. Club Pickup continues to be a delighter for members, and we saw it hit an all-time high in December. We saw strong growth in both desktop and mobile conversion, and mobile purchases nearly tripled over last year. Samsclub.com has also continued to drive growth in digital member sign-ups. As we look at critical touch points that meld our app, site and store, we obviously think about online grocery. In October, we announced we were expanding from five markets to over 20. We've rolled out to those additional markets and we're continuing to see the strong emotional response it triggers with customers and the very personal relationship they're forming with Walmart. Customers are literally jumping out of their cars to rave about it. And one of my recent favorites was a mom with two kids in the back of her car. She told us about how much easier it has made her life because she can shop where and when it's convenient and then drive up and just get her groceries. She placed her order while she was relaxing and watching her kids play. Customers are inviting us into the fabric of their lives. In just a few months, we've dramatically increased online grocery, and look for us to continue expanding this year. Behind all the capabilities we're delivering are some of the best technologists in the world. We've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We've always had one of the strongest enterprise technology organizations. Those teams have worked closely to deliver experiences like online grocery and Walmart Pay that seamlessly merge the app, site and store. Last month, we announced that we are bringing together those teams under a single Walmart Technology banner. This aligns all of our technologists with how our customers see us, one Walmart. I'm excited about the building blocks we've put in place for the future and the ways we're starting to serve customers seamlessly across our app, site and store. We've replatformed our technology and physical distribution, while continuing to grow our business, and we've quickly grown online grocery. This year, we'll focus on three areas : continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers; scaling our online assortment; and expanding online grocery. All these will combine to offer customers compelling experiences that let them shop seamlessly with Walmart in ways that help them save money and save time. As we deliver that seamless experience across our app, site and store, we're building deeper relationships with customers. This relationship is key to building value for the enterprise. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brett. Brett? Brett M. Biggs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016, as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year. Overall, we are pleased with the way we ended fiscal year 2016. In the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 0.6%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. For the year, Walmart International delivered another solid financial performance, with very strong results in Canada and at Walmex. We generated full year constant currency revenue growth of nearly $14 billion, or 2.8%. Currency impacted our full year revenue by over $17 billion. We continue to innovate and make progress toward a seamless shopping experience through a number of initiatives, including an increased number of online grocery markets. While we would've liked to have seen higher e-commerce sales growth this quarter, we continue to make good foundational progress for the future. For the year, we generated approximately $27 billion in operating cash flow, which speaks to our continued financial strength as we transform the company. I'm particularly pleased with our inventory performance in Walmart U.S. During the year, we returned over $10 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We are able to deliver consistent returns to shareholders while investing for the future. ROI decreased to 15.5%, primarily due to lower operating income as well as continued capital investments. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.96 per share to $2 per share in fiscal 2017. We've now increased our dividend for 43 consecutive years. Now, I'd like to spend some time specifically on our EPS results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016. Fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS were $1.49 and $4.59, respectively. Our reported EPS for the same periods were $1.43 and $4.57, respectively. Let me briefly discuss the discrete items that were factored into our adjusted EPS. Recall, in January, we announced the closure of 269 stores globally. Charges for these store closures, which impact both the fourth quarter and full year earnings, resulted in a negative impact of $0.20 per share. Also, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from the December passage by Congress of the tax extenders legislation, which we considered in our fourth quarter guidance. However, the fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate also benefited by $0.14 per share related to other discrete tax items in the quarter. Finally, our full year adjusted EPS also excludes the effects of a benefit of approximately $0.04 from an adjustment for certain leases we disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Now, let's shift gears and discuss fiscal year 2017 guidance. We remain confident that the investments we are making in our associates, our stores and our digital capabilities are the right ones and are better preparing Walmart for the future. It's also important to note that, although we continue to invest in these important areas for the future, we will remain focused on managing expenses across the company. Our guidance today includes several important assumptions, including that the economic conditions in our largest markets remain generally consistent and that the currency exchange rates remain at current levels. From a capital standpoint, as we indicated at our October Investor Meeting, we expect capital investments to be approximately $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, down from fiscal year 2016. Currency remains a headwind for our business, as it is from many U.S. multinational companies. Today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $12 billion on net sales for fiscal year 2017. Additionally, currency is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.10 per share this year, including approximately $0.03 in the first quarter. Now, let's turn to full year sales growth guidance. In October, we guided that on a constant currency basis, net sales would grow 3% to 4% annually over the next three years. Excluding the impact of the recently-announced store closures and the continuing impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our fiscal 2017 sales growth guidance would have remained in that same range. However, including store closures and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, we now expect net sales growth to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2017. As for taxes, our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2017 estimated tax rate ranging between 31.5% and 33.5%. As is the norm, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. I also want to note that historically, the tax extenders legislation has been approved at the end of each year, impacting the fourth quarter tax rate. In the December legislation, many of the relevant tax provisions were either made permanent or passed through 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2017, the benefits of the extenders will be spread across the full year, rather than all being in the fourth quarter. Other discrete items as described above may still cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Taking into account the previously-mentioned assumptions, including currency rates at today's levels, tax rate and the incremental wage investments of $1.5 billion, we expect full year fiscal 2017 EPS to range between $4 and $4.30. This most closely compares to our adjusted earnings per share of $4.59 in fiscal year 2016 and is broadly in line with our guidance from October for our earnings per share to be down 6% to 12% in fiscal year 2017. With respect to the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to range between $0.80 and $0.95. This compares to the $1.03 we reported last year. When comparing to last year's EPS, it's important to note that the first quarter this year will be impacted somewhat more on a year-over-year basis than subsequent quarters due to the timing of wage investments. In closing, I'm honored to serve as the Chief Financial Officer during this very exciting time at Walmart. All of us at Walmart are pleased with the progress we're making and the work of our great associates around the world. We look forward to building on that and serving our customers in the future.

Brett Biggs, Walmart's CFO, will show the overall financial results along with highlights for our three operating segments, Walmart U.S., international and Sam's Club. He will wrap up with guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2017. Now I would like to turn it over to our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Pauline and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98 which is above the top end of our guidance. Excluding a $3.5 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $119.4 billion which is growth of $4.6 billion or 4% over last year. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. We exceeded both our EPS and Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance. As we described in October, we're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening relationships with customers. We're encouraged by the Walmart U.S. comp and believe it is attributable to real improvement in our store experience. Our customers are giving us positive feedback and I'm seeing it myself on store visits and you can see it in the traffic numbers. We delivered comp sales of 1% in Walmart U.S. due to continuing traffic increases which improved 1.5% this quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. It is exciting to see the improvement in core retail fundamentals. For example, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making on inventory. That progress is important in its own right and for cash flow purposes but it can also help create a virtuous loop. When combined with our investments in training and associate education, wages and store structure, it is giving our associates more time on the sales floor to serve customers. Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen and our in stock has gotten better. Our associates are responding and I'm proud of them, Greg Foran and the entire U.S. leadership team. In the quarter we did a better job of managing costs. SG&A discipline improved as our store teams did a good job of more closely aligning expenses with sales growth. Better expense management in the quarter gave us increased confidence to initiate our next phase of U.S. price investment earlier than planned. Over time we intend to lower prices further in a deliberate strategic way to drive our productivity loop. Doing this in a sustainable way takes time and we're seeing progress. Globally on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV grew 7% and 7.5% respectively, growth here is too slow. The U.S. number is better than the global number but neither is as high as we would like. We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities we need to win in e-commerce but we're still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth. For example, our marketplace is ramping up but it takes time to build the assortment to the point where customers realize the depth of assortment. We now offer more than 10 million SKUs on Walmart.com and we're growing that number through a combination of first-party and third-party items. It makes sense that perception will trail reality and we will work on both during the course of this year. We will build on the successes we have seen around the world including in the U.S. and we will continue to work through the challenges we have experienced in key markets like Brazil, China and the UK where our e-commerce and mobile commerce sales are softer. We're pleased with our e-commerce operating system and happy to have our new e-commerce fulfillment centers operational. Those are necessary building blocks. I'm excited about the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationship with customers and help them save both money and time. Our Grocery Pickup service in the U.S. continues to receive high marks from customers and we're continuing to expand it. I'm pleased to share we're announcing nine new markets today bringing our total number of markets to nearly 40 by the end of this month. In addition, in some markets, we will double the number of stores that offer the service locally in May. We expect to continue to quickly expand to new markets. The Walmart app is also allowing us to serve customers in convenient ways whether it is by finding an item in store, researching a product or refilling a prescription. Walmart Pay is enhancing our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience as customers quickly pay with their phone. A few weeks ago we began to expand this service nationwide and we're on schedule to complete the rollout by the end of June. Walmart International had a strong start to the year with 10 of our 11 markets posting positive comp sales and nine of those markets growing comp sales by more than 4% on a constant currency basis. In particular, WalMex and Canada continue to perform well with strong sales, market share gains and solid profit performance. China remains a strategic market for our future and is now our fourth largest international market from a sales standpoint. We recently held a Board of Directors meeting in China and while visiting stores and e-commerce operations, I continue to be encouraged by the pace of operational improvements made by our team in China. A highly competitive environment and food deflation in the UK continued to challenge the market significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends in our business. We're focused on making strategic investments to improve our position in the market and invest in price while being diligent in managing our bottom-line and cash flow. At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the growth in membership income. Plus member penetration is near an all-time high and we like the trend we're seeing. It is clear that members recognize the value that a plus membership brings. Comp sales for the period were in line with our guidance but we know we can deliver stronger results. Leading in digital is a focus area for Sam's and the team is doing a good job of delivering for members as we continue to see strong growth in Club Pickup. Finally, we look forward to welcoming many of our shareholders, investors and associates to Northwest Arkansas in a few weeks for our annual meeting. This is one of my favorite weeks of the year as we get a chance to connect with you and share more of our thinking about the business. We also bring in associates from around the world. It is inspiring to see them and hear their stories. We hope you will join us for a great meeting. In summary, we're continuing to do what we said we would do on our strategic plan and we're getting traction as a result. Now I will turn it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug and good morning everyone. As Pauline mentioned, our earnings materials are a little different this quarter. Our intent is to continue to provide you with a high level of transparency and information but in a more efficient and concise manner. For example, we have added specific comments and highlights on the performance of each of our operating segments within the financial presentation instead of being spread out among several parts of a lengthy transcript. Therefore it is important that you review the financial presentation in conjunction with the comments from Doug and me. We hope you find this new format more efficient and we look forward to any feedback you may have. With that, let's turn our attention to the results for the quarter. I would like to start by taking a minute to thank all of our associates around the world. Over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to visit with associates in our U.S. stores as well as in China, Japan and Brazil and I was encouraged by the level of dedication they continue to demonstrate. As a company, we're executing against our strategic priorities and not only delivering short to midterm improvements but positioning Walmart for long term success. We still have work to do, however, we're pleased that our first quarter results demonstrate continued progress. First quarter EPS of $0.98 was above our guidance range. During the quarter, we saw a benefit from lower utility and maintenance expenses due to a milder winter in the U.S. and slightly lower costs from store closures announced last quarter. From a revenue standpoint excluding the $3.5 billion currency impact, total revenue increased $4.6 billion or 4% to $119.4 billion. On a reported basis, our total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales of 1% due to continuing solid traffic which increased 1.5%. This is our seventh straight quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth straight quarter of positive comp traffic. Globally, e-commerce sales increased 7% and GMV grew by 7.5% in the first quarter on a constant currency basis which is not as strong as we wanted. We're pleased with the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationships with customers and helping them save both money and time, for example our Grocery Pickup service in the U.S. will be in nearly 40 markets by the end of this month which is up from 22 when we started the year. Advances we have made in fulfillment capabilities including our most recent center in Southern California, mean customers can get the items they want fast and at Walmart prices. Although we're making progress on several of our key priorities, we have more work to do particularly in some of our largest international markets. Gross profit increased 60 basis points during the quarter primarily driven by gross margin improvements in the U.S. which I will discuss in more detail shortly. During the quarter, we were more disciplined from an expense standpoint. However as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the first quarter of last year primarily as a result of our previously announced wage rate increase which took effect in February. As you review our financial statement, you will notice a reduction in interest expense as well as an increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest. As a reminder, the primary reason for the year-on-year variances is related to the sale-leaseback accounting correction we made in Canada during the first quarter of last year which impacted these line items and had a de minimis overall impact on operating income and EPS. Along with solid operating performance, disciplined working capital management allowed us to generate approximately $4 billion of free cash flow which compares to $2.2 billion generated in the first quarter of last year. We also returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2.7 billion. With that, let's now turn our attention to the results for each of the operating segments. Walmart U.S. had a good first quarter with comp sales ahead of guidance driven by solid traffic growth. We continued to steadily execute against the plan we laid out a year ago and we're seeing positive results from these efforts. Our customers continue to tell us they are happy with the changes we're making in our stores as evidenced by our customer experience scores which rose again this quarter versus last year. Comparable sales were up 1% in the first quarter despite continued impacts from deflation and food which we estimate impacted our total comp by approximately 60 basis points relative to last year's first quarter comp. Customer traffic increased 1.5%. E-commerce contributed approximately 20 basis points to the overall comp. In addition, our Neighborhood Market format also delivered a comp sales increase of approximately 7%. We have good momentum in the business as on a two-year stack basis comp sales for Walmart U.S. were up 2.1%. We saw strength in general merchandise driven by solid sales growth in hardlines, home and seasonal and apparel. While entertainment continues to be a sales headwind, we did see some improving trends in electronics. Branded drug inflation and script growth drove pharmacy sales while better in-stock levels and a focus on the right assortment drove sales growth in both consumables and OTC. Gross margin improved 44 basis points in the quarter. We delivered improved margin rates in food, consumables and health and wellness as our continued focus on reducing costs both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise provided benefits. In addition, transportation costs benefited from lower fuel prices, we had some improvements in shrink and we also lapped last year's incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion. Operating expenses increased 11.5% over last year primarily due to previously announced wage rate increases. However, our store teams were more efficient in managing expenses to more closely align with sales growth and a milder winter drove lower utility and maintenance expenses. Overall the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins which resulted in an operating income decline of 8.8%. Inventory continues to be a key focus area for Walmart U.S. and we're pleased with the progress we're making toward our goal of stronger working capital management. Inventory declined 3.5% in the first quarter including a 5.7% decline in comp stores. The inventory discipline is driving benefits across the store such as improved in-stock levels and more efficient processes for our associates. Finally, as we communicated in October, price investment is always an important part of our growth plan. We began the initial phase of additional price investment late in the first quarter lowering prices on key items in select geographies. As always we're committed to providing quality merchandise at a great value using data and analytics to better serve our customers. Heading into the second quarter, the execution of Walmart U.S.'s strategic plan remains on course. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%. As a reminder, the comp sales increase for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 1.5%. Now let's turn to Walmart International. Walmart International had a strong start to the year despite some continuing challenges in certain markets. As a reminder in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. Comp sales remain strong with all markets other than the UK posting positive comp sales. Also worth mentioning, nine of our markets grew comp sales by more than 4% on a constant currency basis. This year Easter benefited the first quarter some in International as the holiday last year fell within the second quarter given the one month reporting lag in all markets except Canada. Overall, net sales grew 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 7.2% due to the $3.5 billion currency headwind although the impact was slightly less than anticipated. From an expense and cost of goods perspective, we're pleased with the continued progress we're making on our cost analytics program which includes fact-based negotiations and new merchant tools. We're now expanding the program beyond the UK and Canada to include Mexico in Q2 and other markets in Q3 and Q4. We're also focused on We Operate for Less initiatives across our markets and we're pleased that we leveraged expenses in the majority of our markets. From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 22% on a constant currency basis and increased 8.8% on a reported basis driven by solid sales and broad gross profit rate improvement. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than net sales at 2.2% due to a focus on reducing unproductive and obsolete merchandise while on a reported basis inventory declined 6.9%. Within the accompanying financial presentation you will find detailed information for our five major markets. However, I will give some highlights on these markets starting with two which are performing exceptionally well. WalMex continues to lead the way delivering strong results. As a reminder, WalMex releases results under IFRS and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. Sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries led by strong results in food and consumables. Total sales and comp sales performance significantly outpaced the rest of the self-service market. Comp sales for WalMex increased 8.6% in the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, higher gross margins driven by strong inventory management reduced clearance and good expense management led to strong growth in operating income. In Canada, comp sales increased 6.7% driven by strong traffic growth of 4.6%. Comp sales have now been positive for eight consecutive quarters. The performance was driven by improvements in our merchandise assortment and price investment which led to strong customer traffic growth. Our e-commerce business also continued to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the greater Toronto area. Even as e-commerce investments continued, our ability to leverage expenses led to growth in operating income that outpaced sales growth. The UK continues to struggle, due primarily to fierce competition. Improvements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large-format stores. However, project renewal remains a focus with the aim to simplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce costs and drive sales. The cost analytics program which is part of Project Renewal made good progress and delivered savings we were able to invest back into the business. Our China business continues to grow and is now our fourth largest international market by revenue. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, strong performance during Chinese New Year, double-digit growth in gift card loading and continued strengthening of fresh categories led to good sales growth and positive comps. In Brazil, despite ongoing economic challenges, our team is making the right decisions to better position the business for both short- and long term success. We're pleased with the positive comp sales performance in the quarter. Overall, our International strategy remains simple and focused and we continue to execute against our key priorities around the world. Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, net sales without fuel grew by 2.9%. Membership income increased by nearly 4% as Plus member renewables grew by more than 30% and Plus penetration was there an all-time high. Comp sales excluding fuel increased 0.1% in the period as deflation especially in fresh meat and dairy continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 50 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed 60 basis points to the comp including sales through Club Pickup which grew by more than 30%. In addition, our direct to home business experienced impressive growth. Gross profit rate increased 18 basis points even as we made investments in price and in the cash rewards program. As planned, investments in people and technology led to growth in operating expenses that outpaced our sales growth. The team at Sam's is in the early stages of executing against the strategies as outlined at the end of last year. We know we have work to do and we're on the right path. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect comp sales to be slightly positive. So let's wrap things up. This is an exciting time for the company and our financial strength positions us to make the necessary investments in the business to drive sustainable long term results. We're proud of our overall results in the first quarter and there is momentum in many parts of the business. Based on our views of the global operating environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.08. We appreciate your interest in our company. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Shareholder's meeting in a couple of weeks.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is August 18, 2016. On today's call you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO, and Brett Biggs, CFO. This call contains statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is at the end of this call.

All of this information, along with our store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the investors portion of our corporate website; stock.walmart.com. For fiscal year 2017, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q2 reporting period ran from Saturday, April 30th, through Friday, July 29th, of this year. And, as previously announced, our annual meeting for the investment community will be in Bentonville, Arkansas on October 5th and 6th. We plan on having facility tours on the 5th with our meeting taking place on the 6th. We look forward to seeing you here. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Wal-Mart CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter results. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $123.6 billion, an increase of 2.8% over last year. We exceeded our Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance this quarter, with Walmart U.S. delivering comp sales of 1.6%, driven by a traffic increase of 1.2%. This was our 8th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our 7th consecutive quarter of positive traffic. I\u2019m encouraged by what I'm seeing when I visit stores and pleased with how Greg Foran, our leadership team and our associates are executing our plan to win. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve, and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down 6.5% and in-stock levels are up. We\u2019re also showing progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, GMV and e-commerce sales increased 13% and 11.8% respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets. This was primarily due to growth in our marketplace offering in the U.S., the continued roll out of online grocery and growth of pick-up in stores and clubs. We continue to see proof that our customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience. The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it\u2019s just Walmart. We've built a solid foundation in e-commerce under the leadership of Neil Ashe. During Neil\u2019s tenure, we more than doubled our e-commerce GMV, became the second most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S., re-platformed Walmart.com, opened a national fulfillment center network and most importantly, became known as a great place to work for talented technologists and e-commerce professionals in Silicon Valley. Neil also led our discussions with JD. Neil will be with Wal-Mart through the end of our fiscal year working on our e-commerce strategies in several international markets. I\u2019d like to thank him for his significant contributions to our company. Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com. Operating Walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive a higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay. This empowers customers in a way that is true to the spirit of Walmart. When customers build a basket of goods online rather than ordering one item at a time, shipping economics are in their favor and ours. Wal-Mart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. It\u2019s important to remember that customers won\u2019t see changes immediately as we await government approval, and the necessary tech platform changes, which will take time. Once the acquisition is complete, we look forward to welcoming Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Jet.com. He will join Wal-Mart as our new President and CEO of e-commerce, reporting to me. He will be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Marc is a passionate merchant and innovative thinker who will definitely add value to our business. I look forward to working with him. In China, our recently announced transaction with, and investment in, JD.com improves our position there. JD's significant presence online, where Wal-Mart and Sam's Club will feature prominently, affords us the opportunity to extend the reach of our brands to millions of new customers. I made a couple of visits to JD's delivery and pickup points in Shanghai when I was last in China and am excited about the potential it creates for our customers there. Richard Liu, CEO of JD.com, is a talented e-commerce merchant and we look forward to our collaborations going forward. Additionally, we made advancements in the U.S. on our key priorities to build digital relationships with customers, scale the assortment and expand online grocery. As of June, we have rolled out Wal-Mart Pay nationwide to all stores. Customers tell us they love the convenience of this unique service, and we've found that a majority of transactions come from repeat users. If you haven't tried Wal-Mart Pay, please do and share your feedback. Customers also continue to enjoy our online grocery pickup service and give it high marks. We added grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter bringing our total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. It's gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time. Next, we are growing our marketplace offering at a strong pace. Since the beginning of the year, we've added about 7 million new items to the assortment and today offer approximately 15 million SKUs. Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that the momentum in the business is broad based across all formats and countries. In China, in addition to expanding our reach through the strategic alliance with JD.com, we continue to grow our base of stores and clubs. In fact, we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. China remains a strategic focus for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally. In the U.K., the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics. We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments. While our turn-around will take time, I'm confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we're addressing this with urgency. At Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales for the period were slightly above our expectations. Membership performance was the highlight, and there is quite a bit of innovation underway at Sam's related to the member experience. Earlier this year we launched a test of Scan and Go, a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service, and we expect to roll this out nationwide later this year. We also saw strong growth in the quarter from both Club Pickup and direct to home e-commerce. The new platform we are using to prospect for new members and better manage their accounts will help us deliver on our priority of growing membership. These innovations are making it easy for members to shop and save time. Finally, I've enjoyed my time this week with more than 5,000 store leaders and merchants with the U.S. team at our annual Holiday Meeting in Denver. We've got a great plan for the busiest time of year, and the mood at the meeting was deservedly upbeat. I'd like to thank our store managers and all of our associates for the job they're doing. In summary, I'm pleased with the momentum in the business. We have a plan, and we are executing against it and customers are responding favorably. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. We're half way through the year and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we're seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities, focusing on the customer and improving core retail fundamentals around the world. In addition to delivering solid second quarter results, which I'll talk about in a minute, we continue to make decisions that focus the business for long term success. Just in the past few weeks we've furthered our strategy in e-commerce through the alliance with JD.com and the planned acquisition of Jet.com. In addition, we've agreed to divest our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico, allowing for additional focus on our core business in that market. Each of these decisions aligns with our strategy and demonstrates our commitment to thoughtfully allocating capital against our long term strategy. Now, let's get to the results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.07, which was at the high end of our guidance range, while reported EPS was $1.21. Adjusted EPS excludes a non-cash gain of $0.14, net of tax, from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. We anticipate the gain for the full year will be $0.16 per share, which is within the original guidance range when we announced the transaction. From a revenue perspective, we had another solid quarter. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, total revenue increased 2.8% to $123.6 billion, while on a reported basis, total revenue was $120.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added net sales of $2.8 billion in the quarter and $7.2 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year. Walmart U.S. delivered a very solid comp sales increase of 1.6% driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. It\u2019s now been two full years that Walmart U.S. has delivered positive comp sales \u2013 in fact, on a two-year stack basis, comp sales increased 3.1%. As Doug mentioned earlier, we made progress in e-commerce with GMV and sales, growing 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than the international results, and globally we continue to make headway on expanding our assortment and enhancing the shopping experience for our customers. Whether it\u2019s through Online Grocery, Walmart Pay, or broadening our reach in China through the alliance with JD.com, we're making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want. Now, with the agreement to acquire Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further. Consolidated gross profit margin increased 53 basis points, driven by improvements in all three operating segments. From an expense standpoint, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to our previously announced investments in people and technology for this fiscal year. That being said, our teams across the globe remain focused on managing expenses. In addition to solid operating results, disciplined working capital management and the timing of payments allowed us to generate $10.3 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which compares to $5.1 billion in the first half of last year. Continuing to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases is a priority for us and we're fortunate to have such a strong business model that generates substantial distributable cash even after we've invested thoughtfully into the business. During the quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 30.3 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, we have utilized approximately $7.3 billion of our current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. With that, let's discuss the results for each of our operating segments, starting with Walmart U.S. We continue to see steady improvement in the Walmart U.S. business as customers respond favorably to the changes we're making in our stores and e-commerce offer. Net sales were up 3.1%, or $2.3 billion, and comp sales rose 1.6% with a 1.2% increase in customer traffic. We believe a contributing factor to the results is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we\u2019re making good progress in providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service. We've also broadened our e-commerce assortment, strengthened our mobile capabilities and expanded Online Grocery to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. While there is still a lot of work to do in executing our multi-year plan, we're encouraged by the results we're seeing. E-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp, and all of our formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets, which delivered approximately a 6.5% comp sales growth in the period. Although difficult to quantify, we know overall sales included some tailwinds from external factors such as continued low gas prices and unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. However, we also experienced sales headwinds from continued market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by around 100 basis points and our second quarter total segment comp by a similar amount as what we faced in the first quarter. The grocery business showed improvement from the first quarter with positive comp sales and traffic, despite the ongoing deflationary impacts in food. In addition, both general merchandise and health and wellness delivered solid sales growth with strength in home, toys, sporting goods and OTC. The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing, and we aim to be the destination of choice with low prices on a great assortment of products for parents and students preparing for the new school year. In the second quarter, we continued to implement a multi-year strategy of incremental price investment in the U.S. business. It's still early days for this initiative, but we are pleased with the initial results. We're committed to providing Everyday Low Prices, using data and analytics to better serve our customers both through stores and e-commerce. Gross margin increased 33 basis points in the quarter. Improved margin rates in food and consumables were a contributing factor. In addition, we had improvement in our cost of goods due to savings in procuring merchandise, lower transportation expense as a result of lower fuel costs and some improvements in shrink. These benefits are somewhat offset by the implementation of the multi-year strategy of incremental price investments. Operating expenses increased 8.3% over last year due primarily to the previously announced associate wage rate increases and investments in technology. We remain focused on managing expenses with an EDLC mindset while elevating the shopping environment for customers. Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, resulting in an operating income decline of 6.2%. We're also encouraged by the progress on inventory management with inventory declining about 2.9% in the second quarter versus last year, including a 6.5% decline in comp stores. By cleaning up our store back rooms, leveraging technology and changing certain processes, we're improving product availability and enabling associates to be on the sales floor serving customers in a more effective way. Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase in the range of 1% to 1.5%. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period were 1.5%. Now, let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%. The rate of sales growth in several markets slowed versus our first quarter results, impacted by Leap Day in the first quarter and the Easter holiday shift between first and second quarters in most markets due to the one month reporting lag. Walmex continues to produce strong sales results across all formats, while the U.K. environment remains challenging. The International team remains focused and continues to execute on key strategic priorities; to actively manage the existing portfolio, deliver balanced growth, be the lowest cost operator, and build strong foundations in talent, trust, and technology. We continue to be aggressive in managing the portfolio, announcing last week the agreement to sell our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico. In addition, our recently announced strategic alliance with JD.com in China aligns with our growth strategy in this key market by better integrating our digital and physical retail operations. We also continue to execute aggressive cost reduction programs in the U.K. and Canada, and are expanding cost analytics programs into other markets like Mexico and China. We also announced market CEO moves this quarter in China, the U.K. and Canada. We are confident these moves position us well for driving improved performance in each of these markets and demonstrate the depth of our talent globally. With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.2% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 6.6% due to a $2.7 billion currency headwind. From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 47.5% on a constant currency basis and 35.2% on a reported basis. This increase includes the gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. Excluding the impact from this gain, operating income increased 3.1% on a constant currency basis, which slightly outpaced sales growth. On a reported basis, excluding the gain, operating income decreased 6.7%.  The accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. However, I would like to provide some highlights on each one. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance.  Walmex continues to lead the way, delivering strong results. Keep in mind, Walmex releases results under IFRS and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7.3% in the quarter, significantly outpacing the rest of the self-service market. Excluding the gain from the sale of our bank operations in Mexico last year, operating income would have increased faster than sales. In Canada, despite increased promotional activity by competitors throughout the quarter, comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for nine consecutive quarters, and according to Nielsen we continued to gain market share in food and consumables and Health & Wellness. Our cost analytics program made good progress, helping drive down cost of goods allowing us to invest in price. Excluding the gain from the sale of certain properties in Canada last year, operating income increased faster than sales. Additionally, we continue to decrease inventory levels and improve efficiency from a store and labor perspective. In the U.K., fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5%. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced five-year \u00a31.5 billion price investment. In China, despite negative comp sales of 0.5% this quarter, our business continues to grow as we expand our footprint throughout the country, and we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel.\"We Operate for Less\" initiatives have delivered results, and we were able to leverage expenses. Our recently announced alliance with JD.com enables us to better serve consumers through a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail. JD.com, the leading online direct sales company and the country's largest Internet business by revenue has a complementary offering, allowing us to deliver compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers. We are optimistic about our future in China. In Brazil, despite the ongoing economic recession, we delivered comp sales growth of 4.7%. Our wholesale format continues to perform well and delivered strong growth again this quarter. In addition, we completed our store systems integration, which allows all banners to operate under a single financial system. This will provide better visibility to business outcomes, improved alignment of marketing efforts and further enhance our compliance programs. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with another solid performance from our international business in the quarter.  Now, let's turn to Sam's Club. Net sales, without fuel, grew by 0.4%. Membership income increased 2.9%, as Plus member counts increased and Plus member penetration is near all-time highs. Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.6%, which was slightly above our guidance. Market deflation, especially in food, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. We're pleased with how e-commerce performed as both direct to home and Club Pickup had strong growth. Sam's also continues to make progress on being a leader in the digital space. Our members tell us they really appreciate the convenience that innovations like Scan & Go bring to their lives. This new checkout and payment solution lets members complete the shopping experience using their own mobile device.  Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect comp sales without fuel to be slightly positive. As a reminder, comp sales for last year\u2019s comparable period increased 0.4%. With that let\u2019s wrap things up. There\u2019s always more work to do, but we\u2019re pleased with the first half performance. These results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year give us confidence in raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.35, which includes a range of $0.90 to $1.00 in the third quarter. This compares to previous guidance of $4.00 to $4.30 for the full year. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14, net of tax, non-cash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. In addition, this guidance includes an estimated dilutive EPS impact of approximately $0.05, primarily in the fourth quarter, as a result of expected operating losses, and one-time transaction expenses related to the planned acquisition of Jet.com, assuming the transaction is closed near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY17. Keep in mind that this updated guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels and that our full year effective tax rate is expected to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 31.5% to 33.5%. In closing, we continue to be pleased with momentum we are seeing across many parts of the business. We\u2019re executing against our strategic priorities and continue to focus on the customer. It\u2019s an exciting time at Walmart and we are proud of the progress we\u2019re making. Thank you for joining our call today.

All of this information, along with our recently published fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the Investors portion of our corporate Web-site, stock.walmart.com. For fiscal year 2017, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q3 reporting period ran from Saturday, July 30th through Friday, October 28th of this year. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we delivered another solid quarter and are pleased with the continued momentum in the business. Our associates are doing a good job and it's much appreciated. I'll discuss the details in a minute but I'd like to start by thanking everyone who came to Bentonville for our Investment Community Meeting in October. We enjoyed giving you an update on our plans going forward. We have a strong Company. We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster to better serve our customers every day. When we were together last month, I outlined four priorities, make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer, and deliver results and position the Company to win. By executing on these priorities, the customer and our shareholders will benefit. To start, I'd like to highlight some recent developments in e-commerce that demonstrate how we're moving faster and making every day easier for busy families. First, we're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction. From a marketplace perspective, we're scaling fast, adding 8 million SKUs over the last three months alone. E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Walmart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores. Next, we recently completed the acquisition of Jet.com and we're excited to have Marc Lore as a member of our leadership team driving U.S. eCommerce for Walmart and Jet.com. One of the reasons Jet.com makes sense for Walmart is the common ground we share with basket economics. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours. Marc has hit the ground running since the acquisition was finalized. We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our scale in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment and leveraging the strengths of our marketing teams. We're excited to reap the benefits of our combined businesses and we look forward to updating you on our progress going forward. I'm also excited by how we've positioned our business in China to win. We continue to be pleased with how our alliance with JD.com allows us to reach even more customers with our brands. We recently announced we own roughly 10% of JD.com's shares and during my visit a few weeks ago we jointly launched two new services. Our Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD's Web-site, providing hundreds of millions of customers access to Sam's Club's premium products with JD's same-day and next-day delivery service. We also announced an exclusive Walmart Global imports store on JD.com Worldwide, the company's cross-border platform. The new store provides Chinese consumers access to Walmart's selection of thousands of products imported from Walmart stores around the world. We're working together with them to create a seamless shopping experience. I was able to visit the JD Home Office when I was in China last month and it was clear that they work with speed and the spirit of innovation is strong. When I was in one of our Walmart hypermarkets in Beijing, JD already had a site set up for picking and delivering customer orders. We also announced an investment in New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery online-to-offline, or O2O, seamless e-commerce platform. Already, New Dada is enabling two-hour delivery service from more than 45 Walmart locations. It's amazing to see how O2O is changing how Chinese consumers shop. Densely populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable two-hour delivery and we look to expand the number of locations using New Dada for two-hour delivery going forward. We're moving faster to position the Company to win, and we're doing this from a position of increasing strength. Now, I'd like to move to our third quarter results, where we delivered another solid quarter with earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding the $2.1 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year. Comp store sales grew 1.2% in Walmart U.S., driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. Greg Foran, our U.S. leadership team and our associates continue to execute our plan to win, and it's working. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down approximately 6% and in-stock levels are up. We also continued to show progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, global e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8% respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering, as I mentioned earlier, as well as a contribution from Jet.com. We continue to roll out online grocery and grow our pickup business in stores and clubs. We're making progress giving our customers the seamless shopping experience they are looking for. Dave Cheesewright and the International team delivered another solid performance in the quarter, growing sales in constant currency 2.4%. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and seven of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way and I'm pleased with the fact that our momentum is broad-based across formats and countries within Walmex. I'm pleased comp sales growth returned to positive territory in China. We continue to grow our base of stores and clubs, in addition to the e-commerce initiatives I mentioned earlier. When I was in China, and in conjunction with the Walmart Foundation, we were proud to launch the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center in Beijing with an investment of $25 million from the Company and our foundation. The goal of the center is to develop solutions to food safety that can be implemented across the global supply chain, so Chinese consumers can trust that the food they eat is safe and good for their families. China is clearly a strategic market for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally and we're moving with speed to position the business for success. In the U.K., we're making some progress but our turnaround will take time. We're confident in our leadership team there and want to assure you we continue to address this market with urgency. We have a strong international business and are encouraged by our positive momentum. As we mentioned in October, we are shaping our portfolio and will make appropriate adjustments if it strengthens the Company. You've seen examples of this recently in Chile and Mexico and we'll continue to evaluate and adjust, when it's best. At Sam's Club, Roz and the team grew comp sales, excluding fuel, 1.4% and launched Scan & Go nationwide. Scan & Go is a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service and we're excited about how it will improve our members' experience, making it easy to shop and save time. Whether it's transforming the way members shop or elevating the experience with exciting new merchandise, the initiatives we have underway position us to win. Overall, we're gearing up for the holidays, our busiest time of the year, and we'll be ready with great items at low prices to delight our customers. Here in the U.S., we'll have an expanded assortment online and available for pickup, in addition to holiday helpers in stores to help speed customers through the checkout line. Finally, one of the goals we laid out for you in October was to be the most trusted retailer. Part of building that trust is not only helping customers save money and time but helping them feel good about shopping at Walmart. We want them to be able to trust that the products they buy are good for their families, the planet and the people that made them. So, earlier this month we shared some new targets in sustainability, food and responsible sourcing. We set new goals in the areas of waste, renewable energy and sustainable products including food. Please check out our Web-site to learn more. Customers have more transparency than ever before when they shop and they expect us to lead in these areas, but they will also expect us to earn their trust and we will. We're excited about this work and are committed to lead in what we believe is a new era of trust and transparency in retail. In summary, overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making across our business. We have momentum and we're moving faster. We have a plan to win, we're executing against it and customers are responding favorably. Now, I'll turn it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. Last month at our Investment Community Meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the Company from a position of strength. I laid out the financial framework that will guide our decisions, focused on delivering strong efficient growth, operating with discipline, and strategic capital allocation. Growth going forward will focus more on comp sales and we're investing to accelerate e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. with our acquisition of Jet.com and further scaling Walmart.com. We're moving with speed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Let's turn to our third quarter results. We're pleased that results were in line with our expectations and showed continuing momentum in the business. Excluding currency impacts, each business segment delivered solid net sales growth, and e-commerce GMV and sales growth continued to accelerate. Keep in mind that the results included the operating impact of Jet.com for roughly half of the quarter as well as the transaction costs, both of which were initially forecast to be in the fourth quarter. Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.1 billion currency impact, increased 2.5% to $120.3 billion. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. During the quarter, we added $2.7 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis, which brings year-to-date constant currency growth to nearly $10 billion. Walmart U.S. continued its solid top line performance, and it's clear that our focus on driving value and a better store experience is resonating with customers. International delivered another solid quarter with Walmex once again leading the way. Sam's Club comp sales were better than expected and membership income again showed steady improvement. Third quarter EPS was $0.98 versus guidance of $0.90 to $1. There were a few items that impacted the results that were not anticipated in our guidance, but in total had a minimal impact. The primary items included a gain on the sale of certain shopping center assets in Chile, a tax benefit related to our agreement to sell the Suburbia business in Mexico, as well as the dilutive impact from the earlier than expected completion of the Jet.com acquisition, including transaction costs. Also, recall that last year there was a $0.04 benefit to third quarter EPS due to a lease accounting adjustment. I'll provide more details about our operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce, where results have improved sequentially throughout the year. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8% respectively, with even stronger growth in the U.S. The continuing transition of the Yihaodian e-commerce business in China disproportionately impacted the GMV growth rate versus the sales growth rate this quarter due to the mix of first party versus marketplace sales. Excluding Yihaodian in total, GMV increased 28.6%. E-commerce growth includes a benefit from the six weeks of Jet.com results in the quarter, but the GMV growth rate would still be greater than 20% when excluding this contribution. In the U.S. e-commerce business, we continue to make solid progress expanding marketplace. We're thrilled to have the Jet team onboard and we're moving quickly to accelerate growth. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're making with online grocery. Customer count and basket size continue to outperform our expectations and we've expanded this service to more than 100 U.S. markets. In China, we expect our broader presence on JD.com with the new Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart Global imports store will accelerate growth. We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth. Now let's turn back to the broader business. Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 34 basis points, due primarily to improvements in the U.S. and International segments. As expected, total SG&A also increased primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. We continue to make progress on working capital, driven primarily by continuing discipline in managing inventory and payables. We also had a cash flow benefit this quarter due to the application of new tax guidelines related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. In total, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, compared to $6.8 billion in the first nine months of last year. During this transformational time, a key priority remains using our financial strength to provide strong cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 19.6 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have now returned $10.9 billion to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have utilized approximately $8.7 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. Let's now discuss the results for each of the operating segments in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. Overall, we're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. Sales and traffic increased again this quarter and customer experience scores improved. Walmart U.S. net sales increased 2.5%, or more than $1.8 billion. This growth comes despite persistent market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by approximately 150 basis points, as well as unseasonably warm weather in the back half of the quarter. Comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in customer traffic. On a two-year stack basis, comp traffic was up 2.4%, which was relatively consistent with the first two quarters of the year. E-commerce contributed approximately 50 basis points to the segment comp, which was an acceleration from the second quarter. Also, all store formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets which delivered comp sales growth of approximately 5.2%. Gross margin increased 32 basis points. Savings from procuring merchandise contributed to margin rate improvement in general merchandise, food, and consumables. In addition, transportation-related fuel cost savings favorably impacted results. These factors, which reduced cost of goods sold, were partially offset by the continued implementation of our multi-year strategy of incremental price investment. Operating expenses increased 8.6%, primarily due to the previously announced associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology. In addition, we lapped the lease accounting adjustment that I mentioned earlier, which benefitted last year's U.S. third quarter results. As a result, operating income declined 11.3% for the quarter. Excluding last year's lease accounting adjustment, operating income would have declined 9.8%. We continue to do a good job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. In the third quarter, inventory declined 2%, with comp store inventory down approximately 6%. We continue to execute our plan and are making good progress delivering a better experience for our customers. We're pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and feel good about our plans for the fourth quarter. We're well-positioned for holiday with newness, exciting gift items, and EDLP throughout the assortment. All the pieces are in place to ensure a great shopping experience in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of between 1% and 1.5%. Now, let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continues to deliver solid results. This quarter, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and seven of those markets grew comps by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way with comp sales growth of 7%, representing a two-year comp growth of nearly 13%. Our positive comp sales trend again this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen over the last several years. We will continue to focus on driving growth through our fresh offering, expanding online grocery and private brands. With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.4% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 4.8% due to a $2.1 billion currency impact. Operating income increased 11.2% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, operating income increased 1.2%. In the quarter, there was a gain from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Also, recall that in the third quarter last year, we had a favorable impact from a lease accounting adjustment. Excluding both of these items, operating income increased 9.4% on a constant currency basis. We expect a similar gain in the fourth quarter, reflecting the completion of the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile. Let's now turn to some brief highlights of our key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Additionally, the results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. Let's begin with Walmex, which released its earnings on October 25th. Keep in mind that Walmex releases results under IFRS and that the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some results may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions, and countries. Comp sales for Walmex increased 7% in the quarter and total sales increased nearly 9%. In Mexico, comp sales increased 7.3% and continued to outpace the rest of the self-service market, according to ANTAD. In addition, Walmex did a good job managing inventory, which grew at a slower rate than sales growth. In Canada, net sales increased 3.3% and comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for ten consecutive quarters, and according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in food and consumables, and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program continues in helping drive down cost of goods allowing us to invest in price. In Canada, we also reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. Turning to the U.K., net sales declined 3.8% and comp sales declined 5.8% in the third quarter. The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price. We are moving with pace as we address our customer value proposition in the market. In China, net sales grew 4.2% and comp sales increased 1.6% this quarter. The key drivers of the performance were strong seasonal and festive categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival and a strong performance in fresh categories, an ongoing focus area for us in China. As Doug mentioned, through our recent alliance with JD.com, we continue to offer exciting new ways for customers to access high-quality products from around the world. It was another solid performance from Walmart International. Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Excluding fuel, net sales and comp sales increased 1.8% and 1.4% respectively, and membership income grew by 2.3%. Market deflation, primarily in food, negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 110 basis points versus last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed approximately 60 basis points to the comp growth. Operating income, including fuel, declined year-over-year by approximately 27%, primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses, including planned investments in people and technology, as well as fuel profit and lapping last year's lease accounting benefit. Excluding fuel and the lease-related benefit, segment income decreased approximately 18%. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect comp sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in a range of 1% to 1.5%. With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year EPS guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance resulting in a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 non-cash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, our full year EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.34 to $4.49. The updated guidance assumes that the full year effective tax rate will be between 31% and 32% as well as currency exchange rates remaining at current levels. In closing, we're pleased with our progress in the business and the positive momentum we're seeing. We're excited for the holidays. Thank you for joining our call today and we wish each of you a happy and healthy holiday season.

    "content": "\ufeff Steve Schmitt : Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Walmart's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results. This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is February 21, 2017.  On today's call, you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO; and Brett Biggs, CFO.  This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by that act. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is at the end of this call.  As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the Investor's portion of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com.  For fiscal year 2017, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q4 reporting period ran from Saturday, October 29, 2016, through Friday, January 27, 2017. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release will be on Thursday, May 18, 2017; and our annual shareholder meeting will be held Friday, June 2, on University of Arkansas campus here in Fayetteville.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings materials this morning, we delivered a very solid quarter and it's great to see continued momentum in the business. Total revenue grew 3% in the quarter and increased 3.1% for the year, both in constant currency. Comp sales growth of 1.8% in the Walmart U.S. business this quarter was better than expected, and I'm particularly pleased with the traffic in our stores. U.S. GMV grew 36% in the quarter, so we're headed in the right direction with this important part of our business too. Our international business again delivered solid sales growth in constant currency last quarter and Sam's Club delivered its best comp sales growth of the year. I'm excited about what's happening at our company. We're moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our 4 key objectives, which are : make every day easier for busy families, change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise, deliver results and operate with discipline, and be the most trusted retailer.  Brett's going to take you through the financials. But before he does, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future. Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates, and I'm pleased that in addition to increased wages, we've deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve our in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp store basis. We've also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today's retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited a store in Mooresville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the back room was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster checkout times.  Greg Foran and the team continued to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened 2 new supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like Scan & Go, touchscreens where customers can access more items on walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated health and wellness section. We've got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days, and we're learning at a faster rate. We've also been investing in price and customers are responding. We're confident that continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.  Shifting gears to our international segment. I'm pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and 7 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.  At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a 2-year stack.  In China, we announced an alliance with and investment in JD.com last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam's Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com to approximately 10%, and we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.com Worldwide, which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world. We also announced an investment in last-mile delivery company, New Dada, enabling 2-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company, and we are proud of how we positioned the business to win.  In the U.K., we faced some challenges this past year, and we're addressing these with urgency. We're encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction.  We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year, and we took some decisive action along the way. For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses, such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile, were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do.  Overall, I'm pleased with the consistently solid sales results in international. We have a strong business with good momentum.  Moving to Sam's Club. I'd like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam's Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she's positioned the business for further progress.  With Roz's departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam's Club. John's been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., international and most recently as Sam's Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He's going to be a great leader for Sam's.  We're pleased with our progress in technology at Sam's including the national launch of Scan & Go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct to home and Club pick-up. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we're on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.  Finally, I'd like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster. We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top 3 online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top 3 apps in retail. We acquired Jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly. From a marketplace perspective, we now have over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free 2-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we've seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise. We're also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and Jet to make both platforms better. I'm excited about what's to come. I'm really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire, no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores. Over the holidays, wait times were down for pickup, and we're adding more items to Pick Up Today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.  In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We're moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future. According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly, customers continue to rely on brick-and-mortar formats. The supercenter remains the best retail format in the world and, going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise and that's what we're doing.  So in summary : We have a clear strategy we're executing against; we're uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets; we have momentum across the business, which positions us well for the new fiscal year; and while we must do more, we believe we're on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.  Now I'll give you to Brett. Brett Biggs : Good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We've made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We're moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we're confident this will drive value for shareholders. And while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage. For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments. I'll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.  Now let's discuss the results in more detail starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It's important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar. Walmart U.S. delivered strong top line performance with comp sales of 1.8% exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam's Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected with continued strength in e-commerce and omnichannel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper end of our guidance range.  Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both international and Sam's Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I'll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. In both this year and last year's fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these discrete items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we'll be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect to slightly lever expenses in fiscal year 2018.  I'll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we're changing rapidly and remaining laser-focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5%, respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.  Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clearer view of our performance particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past. Sam's Club e-commerce and the various international e-commerce initiatives will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions. As we discuss Walmart U.S. e-commerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.  We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pick Up Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.  We're seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shipping promise with a $35 minimum order available at walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this new offer and e-commerce sales have strengthened since its launch on January 31. Looking ahead, you'll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We're excited about the things we're doing, the speed at which we're doing them and the work we still have to do.  In the fourth quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year, and I'm really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables. For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion or more than 30% versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart's financial strength. When you consider that we were able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A, including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it's a fantastic achievement.  We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in fiscal 2018. We've now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We're proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders while investing in future growth. Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of Online Grocery. We've now seen 9 consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we're gaining traction and it's exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money. For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in grocery, despite ongoing market deflation in food which negatively impacted the food comp by approximately 90 basis points. Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multichannel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item.  Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefited the margin rate, but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns. We're entering the new year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures. Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year, primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce. As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year, we adjusted for discrete items. This year's fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year's fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year. Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year.  The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1% with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.  To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.  Now let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results where the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.  For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind. From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile, as mentioned last quarter.  Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.  Let's now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.  Let's begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD, including self-service, specialty and department stores. In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in traffic-driving categories, like food and consumables and health and wellness.  Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we're encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition. In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam's Club. We're excited about the future of e-commerce in China. The strategic alliance of JD.com will continue to expand our presence throughout the country and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites of JD's platform.  So overall we're pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year. Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We're making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.  During the quarter, top line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales excluding fuel of 2.4%. SamsClub.com GMV was strong increasing by 25% and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income excluding fuel declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with charges related to the impairment of clubs. In addition, this year's fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year's fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.  For the year, net sales excluding fuel increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income excluding fuel declined 7.3%. Looking ahead for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.  With that, let's discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided the fiscal 2018 full year EPS based on currency rates at that time would be relatively flat to adjusted full year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. dollar basis. We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018's tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter. Certainly, we are aware of and engaged in the discussions around tax reform in the U S. As more information comes to light, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change.  When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact of about $0.05 per share. As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.  Net sales on a constant currency basis are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business in most parts of the world to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We're focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S., while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating e-commerce growth including the third-party marketplace. Based on current exchange rates, we would anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%.  There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today including that economic conditions in the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures excluding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.  So in closing, I want to thank all of our great associates around the world for the progress we've made as a company this past year. As a team, we'll win with customers by serving them in new and exciting ways and deliver for our shareholders in this new fiscal year.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is May 18, 2017. On today's call, you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO and Brett Biggs, CFO. This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements is at the end of this call. As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, interactive earnings site and other materials are available on the Investors\u2019 portion of our corporate Web site stock.walmart.com. For our U.S. comp sales reporting in fiscal 2018, we utilize a 52-week calendar. Our Q1 reporting period ran from Saturday, January 28, 2017 through Friday, April 28, 2017. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting will be held Friday, June 2 on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. This meeting starts at 8 A.M. Central Time and is also available for viewing via webcast through our Web site, stock.walmart.com or via Walmart\u2019s Investor Relations app. We will release second quarter earnings on Thursday, August 17. Also, please save the date for our Investment Community Meeting, which will be held in Northwest Arkansas on October 9 and 10. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning, everyone. As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter and we\u2019re encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I\u2019d say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%.There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we\u2019ll touch on later. Inside the Company, we can see that we\u2019re moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we\u2019re capable of, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. I\u2019m really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We\u2019re creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online. Let me give you a few examples. A few weeks ago while visiting stores in Oklahoma City I saw first-hand how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in one store showed us how she now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we\u2019ve developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska. I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we\u2019ve an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools, our associates are embracing them and the results are improving. This is important because our key to winning starts with how we work inside the Company. We\u2019re transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use online grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go at Sam\u2019s Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online grocery also continues to perform well and we\u2019re on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We\u2019re taking steps to save customers time as well as money. Brett\u2019s going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I\u2019ll talk briefly about each area. Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected, due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks, but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter. We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools. I\u2019m proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart and I\u2019m excited about the training we\u2019re providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year. Remember, 75% of our Walmart U.S. store management teams started as hourly associates, so it\u2019s critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our Company. Overall, the store business is getting stronger and I\u2019m thankful to Greg Foran and the team for a thoughtful plan and the energy they\u2019re investing to lead the improvement. Greg, Marc Lore and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are plowing new territory and I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s to come. In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction and we\u2019re working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched two new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made the change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don\u2019t have to pay a membership fee to get two-day shipping on millions of items. Second, we recently began offering customers pick-up discounts on non-store items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers, and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first and third-party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year, so our assortment continues to ramp. We also made a few small, but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment, while gaining critical category expertise in higher margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall, we\u2019re making progress in providing the seamless shopping experience our customer\u2019s desire and we will keep moving along this journey. Staying in the U.S., let\u2019s talk about Sam\u2019s Club. John Furner and team have hit the ground running. They\u2019re focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter led by 1.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 21%. I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019re ramping up our private brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We\u2019ve streamlined 20 private brands into one and will be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded Member\u2019s Mark. The team at Sam\u2019s Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. Outside the U.S., Dave Cheesewright and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant-currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well. At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was nearly 4% this year and 12% on a two-year stack. In April, I visited our businesses in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast-forward as it relates to all things digital including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continue to improve and Sam\u2019s Clubs are doing well. Working with JD.com and New Dada, China\u2019s largest local on-demand logistics and grocery O \u2013 to \u2013 O, short for online to offline, delivery platform, we now offer one-hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the two-hour service we launched last year. We can see the benefits of omni-channel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate. Given the urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. I saw some similarities in Japan where stores are serving more than one purpose. In both markets, we\u2019re piloting the use of stores as shipping locations and we\u2019re learning what works best from a financial point of view in different types of store trade areas given how customer densities and travel distance can vary. Moving on to Canada, our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. We\u2019ve made some progress in the U.K. and the team is executing their plan. We are navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. For the overall segment, International had another solid, predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shift our positioning in terms of store formats, on line grocery and e-commerce. In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we\u2019re executing against. We\u2019re uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We\u2019re making progress and we know we\u2019re on the right track as we work to become the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our Annual Shareholders\u2019 meeting here in northwest Arkansas. Thanks for being interested in our business. Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As I\u2019ve been saying over the past few quarters, this an exciting time to be at Walmart, and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives are underway both to accelerate growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top-line performance at Sam\u2019s Club remains solid. On today\u2019s call I\u2019m going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We will discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong, efficient growth, operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation. Let\u2019s start with our consolidated results. EPS was $1, which is at the top end of our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarterly EPS increase in more than two years on an underlying basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top-line performance across the business. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps of 1.4%, while Sam\u2019s Club posted comp sales, without fuel, of 1.6%. In Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps, even as the timing of Easter and last year\u2019s Leap Day negatively impacted results. The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I\u2019m pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat, while Walmart International was up slightly. In regard to operating discipline, while we didn\u2019t leverage expenses on a consolidated level primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I\u2019m pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We\u2019re making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year primarily due to an increase in incentive payments, as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year. As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodels of 95 stores globally, and in the U.S. we continued to expand our online grocery service to include nearly 670 locations. We also added a limited number of new stores, and made two relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Before I get to our operating segments, I\u2019ll talk about Walmart U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all web-initiated transactions including those through Walmart.com such as ship to home, ship to store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands. Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com. This is extraordinary growth, and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we\u2019re generating across our e-commerce offerings. We\u2019ve recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items, and launched a new service called Pickup Discount, where customers can order non-store products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that\u2019s convenient for customers and saves them money. Let\u2019s now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that the first quarter started out slower than anticipated from a sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks. As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a two-year stacked basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly primarily due to lower sales of higher ticket items at the beginning of the quarter, as well as continued price investment. Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than three years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment. We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period, as both food and general merchandise performed well. Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn\u2019t leverage expenses for the overall segment, I\u2019m pleased that we leveraged in the stores. Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than three years. The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 7.3%, while in-stock levels remained high. We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. Now, let\u2019s move on to Walmart International. The International business continues to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, International performance was negatively impacted by one less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year. Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to divest two businesses, Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico. In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first-party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year we began to wind down the first-party business, with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this 10 year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we lap the unwinding of the business. Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of its apparel format, Suburbia. The gain from the sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result, we expect a net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Beginning in the second quarter, and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International\u2019s results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to the sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 for the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. We\u2019ll continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year. Now, let\u2019s move on to the overall international results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%, and excluding Yihaodian, net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by a $1.2 billion currency headwind. From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis. During the quarter, a benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets. Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Let\u2019s now turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our four major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. Let\u2019s begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased over 13% on a two-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service. In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased, and according to Nielsen we continued to gain market share in key traffic driving categories like food and consumables & health and wellness. Continued planned investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program. In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of one less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low margin bulk sales. During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd-sourced delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer one-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories such as produce and frozen items on our Sam\u2019s Club flagship store on the JD.com platform. Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 0.9%, while comp sales declined 2.8%. When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We\u2019re confident we\u2019re on the right track. So, overall, our international strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year. Let\u2019s turn to Sam\u2019s Club. At Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories, and comps have been positive for five consecutive quarters. We\u2019re also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%. The team at Sam\u2019s is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives underway at Sam\u2019s are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We\u2019ll deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales, without fuel, to increase between 1% and 1.5%. With that, let\u2019s discuss total company EPS guidance. We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08. In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day. As a Company, we\u2019re moving with speed and executing against the strategy we\u2019ve outlined, and it\u2019s all happening through the lens of our financial framework. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Shareholders\u2019 meeting in a few weeks.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is August 17, 2017. On today's call you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO as well as Brett Biggs, CFO. This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements is at the end of this call.

All of this information, along with our fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the investors\u2019 portion of our corporate website stock.walmart.com. For our U.S. comp sales reporting in fiscal 2018, we utilize a 52-week calendar. Our Q2 reporting period ran from Saturday, April 29, 2017 through Friday, July 28, 2017. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our annual Investment Community Meeting will be held in Northwest Arkansas on October 9 and 10. Registration will begin next week. Also, we will release [second] quarter earnings on Thursday, November 16. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon. Douglas McMillon : Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid with continued topline momentum in the business. Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 1.8% and comp traffic 1.3%. We continue to gain traction in e-commerce with Walmart U.S. GMV up 67%. The U.S. store team has done a great job staying focused on providing a fast and easy customer experience while managing expenses and inventory. Customers are responding to the improvements we\u2019re making to deliver a seamless shopping experience that saves them time and money and that\u2019s exciting to see. In addition, Sam\u2019s Club delivered comp traffic growth of more than 2%. In International, nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. So overall, we\u2019re making progress across the business and feel good about where we are midway through the year. Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families. To accomplish this, we continue our transformation to become more of a digital enterprise that moves with speed and agility. I\u2019m encouraged by innovation in the business. We\u2019re testing associate delivery of walmart.com orders in a few stores and by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have approximately 100 automated pickup towers in stores across the U.S., where customers can pick up their orders within a matter of minutes. With Easy Reorder on walmart.com, a customer has visibility to their past in-store and online purchases. In a matter of seconds, they can easily repurchase the items they\u2019ve bought most frequently before and save the time it may have taken to make a weekly shopping list. Another example is our integrated back-to-school offering. Our dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than a million classrooms across the United States. They can find their own list by simply entering their zip code and quickly adding all the items from the school list to their basket. Then, they can choose whether to pick up the items at their local store or ship them to their home. It\u2019s a huge time-saver for busy families. If you haven\u2019t done your back-to-school shopping, you should definitely check this out. We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics and image analytics to scan aisles for outs and we\u2019re using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing. Sam\u2019s Club members continue to provide great feedback on the convenience of Scan & Go and we\u2019ll be further expanding Scan & Go within Walmart U.S. this year. This quarter, we also enjoyed welcoming entrepreneurs from more than 500 small businesses to Bentonville to pitch their Made in the USA products to sell in our stores and online as part of our Investing in American Jobs Open Call in June. And last month, we released proposals for policy actions to address barriers to manufacturing growth here in the U.S. We\u2019re pleased to be making progress towards our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. Customers want to buy products that are not only good for their families, but also for the people that made them. In e-commerce, customers are responding favorably to our expanded assortment, which surpassed 67 million SKUs on walmart.com. Our recent acquisitions, such as Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Bonobos, further improved our assortment, and have provided critical category expertise in higher margin categories like shoes and apparel. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Boston to meet with the Shoebuy team, which is now known as shoes.com. They were very engaged and really impressive. In addition, I was excited to visit with the Moosejaw team in Detroit in July. This talented group is thriving in their creative culture and it was great to hear what they\u2019re working on. We believe that we\u2019re uniquely positioned to grow and delight customers by providing the seamless shopping experience they desire. Having stores within 10 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population allows us to serve customers in ways that are most convenient for them. We\u2019ve seen strong results from the rollout of online grocery, which is now in more than 900 U.S. locations, and we\u2019re expanding this service in many of our markets around the world. Retail is constantly evolving and it\u2019s critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I\u2019ll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It\u2019s exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both. Under Greg Foran\u2019s leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years. We\u2019re also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leveraged expenses for the second consecutive quarter. We\u2019ve done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels. Store associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks and we\u2019re becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We\u2019ve now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year. In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust topline growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience. They love not having to pay a membership fee to get Walmart\u2019s free two-day shipping on millions of items. And we\u2019re seeing a nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up non-store items at their local stores. Marc, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customers\u2019 desire. Staying in the U.S., let\u2019s talk about Sam\u2019s Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam\u2019s Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 23%. Overall, we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow and I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019re leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We\u2019re also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member\u2019s Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing. Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with nine of 11 markets posting positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall. Walmex continues to be the strongest International market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What\u2019s even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions. In China, our stores are improving and we launched Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club global flagship stores through our alliance with JD.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than one hour through the JD Daojia delivery platform. Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we\u2019ve made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic driving categories. We\u2019re also encouraged that the UK delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. There\u2019s still much more to be done, but we\u2019re clearly headed in the right direction. While there, I visited stores as well as our Heston grocery-delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pick-up and delivery from stores, but also from fulfillment centers in higher-volume environments. So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce. In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged with the solid first half results. We are uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire. I\u2019m pleased with how we\u2019re equipping our associates to deliver it. I\u2019d like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers in all the ways they choose to shop. It\u2019s making a difference. We have a clear strategy that we\u2019re executing against and good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart. Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first half of the year. We are improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online. We are guided by our financial framework to deliver strong, efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We are making progress on each element, and it\u2019s through this lens that I\u2019ll discuss our results. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 was at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results. Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05. It\u2019s also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the Company\u2019s EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China. Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year. Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment. We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leveraged expenses in our U.S. stores, as well as in the International segment. As a Company, SG&A delevered by 10 basis points in the period, primarily due to increased technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam\u2019s Club. We expect to slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we are going in the future. We have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m encouraged by the focus I\u2019m seeing. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first six months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. We are still seeing improvement in working capital, but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability. In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally, and in the U.S. we further expanded our online grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income. Let\u2019s now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands. Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the topline as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is growing quickly. We are delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free two-day shipping on millions of items and Easy Reorder, as well as an expanded assortment, now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter. With Easy Reorder, we\u2019re integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we\u2019ll begin to lap the jet.com acquisition in the third quarter. Now, let\u2019s move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales, increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a two-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. The grocery business continued to improve as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation in food, excluding our own price investments. All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment. Keep in mind the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to a customer\u2019s home, but also omni-channel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as Online Grocery and Pickup Today. Gross margin rate declined five basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate but was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business, as well as continued investments in price. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn\u2019t leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remained high and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology. Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase. Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8%, while in-stock levels remained high. We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing, and we\u2019re providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. Now, let\u2019s move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continued to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year. The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad-based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter. Operating income declined by 2% on a constant currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were a few items from international affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency. Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant currency basis. We delivered these results even as we continued to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period, even as we made important investments. Let\u2019s now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our four major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. Let\u2019s begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on a two-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service. In Canada, net sales increased 3.4%, and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved our price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic driving categories such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increased. Turning to the UK, net sales increased 3.9%, and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments in the value proposition, and we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. In China, net sales increased 2.5%, and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores, and while we saw a negative impact to topline results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in the fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays. From an e-commerce perspective, we continued to expand our offering through the alliance with JD.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than one hour. Moving on to Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We\u2019re serving members across multiple channels, and our e-commerce initiatives produced strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% or Club Pickup. Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to a charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close four underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture greater share in this space. We\u2019re laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%. With that, let\u2019s talk about guidance. We\u2019re pleased with our first half performance. Given our results to-date, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full-year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full-year. The initial guidance for full-year EPS assumed a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full-year effective tax rate around 32%. As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent. Overall, we\u2019re doing what we said we would do, executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we\u2019re heading as a Company and how we\u2019re improving our customer\u2019s lives. As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do every day. You serve an incredible number of customers each day, and you do it well.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Schmitt with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings. This is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team. Hopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning. I'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A. There will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials. So let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter. We had a really strong quarter. We have broad-based growth. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion. We delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share. So we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them. We recently completed a debt tender offer. We made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter. We made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets. So excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business. Walmart U.S. comp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%. We saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes. Our Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 50%. Sam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes. International delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales. Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us. We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S. comp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares. Just a couple of reminders. We'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website. So please mark your calendars for that. And at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. We saw a noticeable down trick in your U.S. gross margin even if you back out the hurricane-related impact, and you cited the price investments and the mix shift to eComm. Those have presumably been drags on the gross margin for the last several quarters. So why did it take a noticeable step down this quarter? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Let me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S. basis. So on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points. And you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S. hurricane-related expenses that we had. I'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts. So just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter. For Walmart U.S. specifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter. Price investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well. And the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that. So I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price. We're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders. It's really the productivity beginning to turn for us. So you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses. That's our plan. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : And my follow-up question is, Steve, in recent times, there's been talk about Walmart potentially charging higher prices online than in-store. Can you describe the thought process behind that, and the potential risk that customers would experience from having segmented pricing across channels? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Sure. So if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online. The fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi. Thanks, Steve. Nice quarter. Our question is about smart cart technology and how you're thinking about leveraging a lot of the Jet technology, just where you are with that in relation to Walmart? And then secondly, I'd love your thoughts on the Lord & Taylor deal, and just some of the strategic rationale there would be helpful? Thank you. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Oliver. So the first question around smart cart technology. It's something that we continue to look at. We need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart.com, but nothing really more to add at this time. In terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience. Think about it as a flagship store. This is expected to launch in the spring. It will be dedicated store on Walmart.com and in the app. We're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site. So we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And Steve, some of our work around customer survey satisfaction at Cowen has been volatile. Can you revisit clean, fast, friendly, and is there anything we should note that's happening, and opportunities to continue to enhance customer satisfaction at large? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Well, I think there's a lot of things. If you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S. business, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint. So, we continue to look at it. It's a point of emphasis for us. I think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thanks. And just lastly, inventories, they were down. They look attractive. Are you feeling like that's a continuation, where we continue to see negative inventories, and are you fine with that relative to in-stock levels and sell-throughs? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: So we're happy with our in-stocks. We continue to make progress on inventory. You've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you. Best regards. Happy holidays. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks. You too. Operator : The next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. First, I wanted to ask about the core business, if we just do some math, excluding some of the hurricane impact. I think if you take out, let's say, the midpoint of 40 basis points from the hurricane and then you add back the EBIT, I think $150 million, it tells that \u2013 U.S. EBIT margins were up a little bit. I'm guessing that's how you're looking at that performance. Just want to confirm that that's a fair way to look at it? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: I think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I don't know if you'll talk about this, but did Jet.com benefit to the comp, and then bigger picture, your eComm was up 50%. I think the out-year guide is a 40%. Is basically \u2013 you're just going to mix out. You're going to \u2013 and Jet was in part of the quarter, I guess, and so it'll fall a little bit out of it in the next quarter. Are you just glide-pathing to that 40%? Is there any change in that growth rate that we should expect going forward? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Well, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up. Jet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work. So there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results. Really the way we think about eCommerce is really in total. Jet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall. We made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S. eCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole. In terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business. I think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go. But in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And the last piece, in the PowerPoint, you called out automotive is a strong category. Is that growth in services, in unit count on vehicles that you're performing services on or is that in the product side if you know? Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Yes. Simeon, this is Kary. It is on both. Really solid performance in automotive as you've seen over the last number of quarters and it goes from, certainly a step up service aspect but also good price point on things like tires for instance that are driving customers increasingly to Walmart's automotive area. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. I wanted to ask about the food business. You guys called it out, the great comps. Can you give some color on what you guys are doing to make it so strong. Is the online store pick up really supporting those comps significantly? Have you been doing any special promotions in food? Anything on how you're driving that? And then \u2013 and also I noticed, I think the commentary on inflation was that it was the same or maybe even a little bit lower. Can you give us any color on how you guys see the inflation outlook in your food business going forward? Thanks. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Robby. Maybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail. So we'll take the inflation piece first. So the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very \u2013 it's \u2013 you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter. The fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets. As we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward. In terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up. We know that that's working for our customers. We continue to expand it. We're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year. So that's a big initiative for us. It's working and our customers love it. In terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things. It's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well. Kary, anything else you want to add? Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: I think it's great that the customers earlier responded to areas we've spent a lot of focus on, particularly fresh areas, fresh categories and that business has really sequentially improved. Price points are right. There's a good assortment. The presentation within the stores is really, really good. And then top that off with online grocery. So I would say that's certainly key areas on top what Steve said. Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is the spread between the comp at a online grocery store versus a Walmart store without it? Is it dramatic? In terms of the comp trending grocery between those two? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: We won't give the specifics of that. But we know it's an initiative. It's working for us based on our rollout plans. Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks, guys. I had to try. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Robby. And I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on two things on the U.S. margin specifically. I think (13:55) the first thing is, you actually are now leveraging expenses in the U.S. How should we look at that with labor costs accelerating pretty rapidly? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Okay. So I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business. One of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs. We need to be more efficient. We talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that. We have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have. So that's what we continue to do. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : And then as far as the gross margin... Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Yeah. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : ...we've talked about it a little bit. But I was just wondering could you give us any thoughts about freight, a lot of companies we cover had been talking about freight cost going up and that's pressuring them. How should we think about that factor as far as Walmart goes maybe fourth quarter and beyond? Thank you. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. I think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business. We have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception. But I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing. Thanks. Rob, next question please? Operator : Yes. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Just a quick question on leverage. So, obviously you saw some pretty good leverage in 3Q and it was, I guess, even higher if we add back a portion of that $150 million hurricane impact. So I guess the question is, is there anything that you could point to specifically that helps you get that leverage this quarter? And how do we think about it from \u2013 and then obviously, I know the comp was strong, so that was part of it. But, how do we think about the sustainability of that into the fourth quarter and beyond? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Well, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped. But it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall. I know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward. There's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall. It's great that we started to see that in the third quarter. We've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that. But it's not one thing, it's a lot. Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, in the commentary on U.S. merchandise highlights, you included the comment about improvement in private brands. Any color you could give, maybe in terms of how many SKUs you added, anything? I know you're really reluctant to directionally give a penetration number. But if there's any color you could give on that, that would be great. Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Sure, Karen. Penetration does continue to grow. And I think what's great about this is it spans multiple categories. You think about areas like food, where we're introducing different private brands. You saw an announcement earlier this quarter about our Baby, and improving the private brand offering within our Baby categories, certainly in consumables, health and wellness, you have a good selection. So it's a key area of focus for us, as you've heard from Greg. Often, we think there's an opportunity there to give an improved quality at the right price point for the customer, and that will continue to be a focus. Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And the percent penetration, will we ever get that? Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Not today. Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Karen. Rob, next question please? Operator : The next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to hit on pricing real quick. Was there any change sequentially in the pricing strategy? And did the return of inflation play a role in the impact on the gross margin? Because obviously, it's harder to invest in price in an inflationary environment. I'm wondering if it's simply more of the gross margin pressures, because the costs are cupping (18:01) back, and it's more costly to invest in price in that type of environment. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks for your question. So, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now. The details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest. So pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line. So we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding. Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just a follow-up on grocery. I think you said comps were up low single digits in the category, in food. It seems like hurricanes would have an outsized impact here, and just based upon the tone out of Doug, it certainly seemed like there was an acceleration sequentially. Excluding the hurricanes, did that business still accelerate sequentially? Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: We've seen really improving trends overall over the last number of quarters in the grocery business, and it really gets to a lot of the things we've talked about earlier on the call. More discipline around, stepped-up presentation for the customer, good assortment, our fresh business has improved, price points are right. So the customers are increasingly coming to Walmart. Traffic continues to improve in the grocery business as well. And ticket is falling, we talked about increased units. So certainly, hurricanes are a factor within the number, but you've seen continued improvement in the grocery business, as we've spoken about over the past year. Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Doug spoke in his prepared remarks that both new and old customers are adopting some of the online efforts. I was hoping you guys could dig into the new customer bucket, and if there's any way you could quantify that for us? Is it a younger customer, and how do you cultivate that new shopper so that she keeps coming back, both online and in-store? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Well, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S. population in general. We're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers. So we continue to push that forward. In terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information. But we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways. We're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year. We'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that. Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Okay, thanks. And follow-up would be, in the past you guys did a lot of survey work on the health of the consumer. Wondering if you guys are still doing that? And then when you look at the acceleration in your comp, how much of it do you think is you versus any macro tailwinds that are out there? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: We do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck. So there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer. The real \u2013 I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well. We haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now. Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Okay. Just my last quick one would be, just on inflation, U.S., you said it was up about 30 basis points in the U.S., but Sam's it was up closer to 70 basis points. I'm wondering why such a divergence between the two segments? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: That's really a different product mix and more than anything. Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Okay. Thanks. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thank you for your questions. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Couple of questions. The first one is, within the U.S. business, the comp store sales, was there any variability month-to-month that you would call out? And I was wondering if you could give us an update on the associate delivery test underway, how that's going? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. In terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing. It's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have. But not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers. So we continue to watch that and learn from it. Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: As far as business performance month-to-month, we really don't get into those details. There's just a lot of noise and variability from holiday shifts and otherwise. And certainly with the hurricanes there was increased noise. So overall where we land it was in a pretty good spot. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: And nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have. Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. And I was wondering if you could just maybe comment on the electronics category both online or also in the store, just how you're thinking about that heading into holiday? Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Yeah. We have a great holiday planned. We think we've put together something we work on for a long time and even spend some time with kids and picking out toys and electronics that they increasingly use. And so we think we have a good assortment of product for the holiday that will appeal to a large portion of customer. And I think we'll have that assortment available in a big way both in-store and online. Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Good luck. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to circle back to Sam's Club, nice acceleration in comp. If you can just flesh that out for us, seems like you certainly expect this trend to continue given the 4Q guidance. Also, if you can touch on any membership trends coming out of Sam's? And then just as my follow-up, if you can just go into maybe a little bit more detail on how the hurricanes impacted this quarter, particularly on the margin side, just a little bit more detail on that would be helpful? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Maybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul. In terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S. business, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit. Sam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points. We talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S. \u2013 Walmart U.S. business and about $20 million for Sam's. So I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint. In terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic. So a 3.6% member traffic growth. We have members coming in more frequently. We have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs. And that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : The next question is from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. My first question relates to health and wellness, where I think you saw comps accelerate to mid-single digits from low single digit. Anything in particular drive that pickup in momentum? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Matt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance. There was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. Second question I want to ask real quick. So you said you gave us all the detail you could on the storms, I'm going to try to go slightly deeper into one. If you think about that comp benefit that you discussed, would you expect that that would have benefited ticket or traffic, if you could differentiate? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Probably both. I mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. That's helpful. And then finally, just to get clarity on where some of the one-time items that are excluded from adjusted earnings are showing up in the divisional P&L. Should the FCPA be taken out of unallocated, and the international real estate taken out of International? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: See from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall. And one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up. So if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. Thank you so much, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Citi. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question is a little bit bigger picture in nature, but you've pursued a lot of different strategies with buying brands in some cases, like ModCloth and Bonobos, and then partnering in other cases, like with Lord & Taylor. Can you just walk us through how you're thinking about the strategy of acquisition versus partnership, and why one way makes sense versus the other, depending on what that relationship is? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: I think the key is to be flexible. If you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense. You have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms. And then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties. So I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I can ask a second question, unrelated. Do you have any perspective on the impact of door closures, more from the mid-tier channel that you could be benefiting from? Obviously the demographics are a little bit different, but do you have any measures that you're picking up share from that area in particular, either with ladies apparel or any other category? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: I think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel. But, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share. It's hard to dissect on who from. So I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you. But thanks for your question, Kate. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. My question was around Jet.com and Walmart.com. I had ordered something on Walmart.com recently, and noticed that I got a discount for accepting a delivery time that was beyond the two days, and that's very Jet.com-like, and I'm wondering how much of Jet.com type discounts Walmart.com will be integrating into its own website, such as discounts for using debit versus credit or volume buys or skipping free returns, et cetera. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks for the question. I think it's TBD. I think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward. So we've got a lot of ideas. We have a lot of initiatives underway. A lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about. So I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : And then my second question was around pricing, and I imagine when you started the pricing campaign, the lower prices, you had to expect that some would respond. What I'm curious about is, to the extent that you can comment on it, to what extent are you cutting price further as a competitor comes in and gets close or matches where you are? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: We certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time. So we continue to do that. Our brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Good morning, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So my question is, let's assume half the hurricane impact was on traffic, half was on ticket. Is there anything you guys can point to that cause average ticket to spike up this quarter, especially, given your continued price investments? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Bigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot. Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Yes, we definitely sold more units and our \u2013 again, this gets back to some of the areas that we've talked about already on this call. The food business being very strong, health and wellness continues its good trends. And we saw a pickup in some general merchandise categories as well. Areas like hard-line, automotive performed quite well again this quarter and even saw a tick up in apparel. So, all those are contributing to the overall ticket performance. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then just a housekeeping item. I didn't see it in the release. Do you guys have the number of SKUs that were available on your eComm platforms at the end of the quarter? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: It's over 70 million. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Over 70 million. And what does that compare to Steve? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: In the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million. Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: That's right. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: So we continue to make progress. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up. Do you guys worry about going too high end again? You know I know like we saw you add a KitchenAid, you've got this relationship with Lord & Taylor. And I feel like in the past there was a time and maybe it wasn't so much that you went high end, but the stores maybe got very cleaned up and things were almost too nice for a little while. But is there any risk of alienating your core customer with some of these new higher end brands? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks for your question, Joe. And we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is \u2013 it's a great brand that now is associated with us. So, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data. We analyze the data really well. We know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website. We think it helps the brand overall. So we'll watch brands like that. We're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Got it. Thanks. And then another, just a quick follow-up, just shift gears to international for a second. The UK, we've seen second quarter now positive comps. Is it simply the price investment that you're getting back in line with the right to be more competitive or are there other things going on that are helping to drive the comps in the UK? Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: I think pricing is a piece of it. But I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter. Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: Thanks. Thanks, guys. We appreciate. We don't have any more questions in the queue. So I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays. Take care.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host Steve Schmitt with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Steve Schmitt.: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Walmart's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results. Joining us on today's call are Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, Brett Biggs. Doug and Brett will have some opening remarks in a minute, and then we'll take your questions. We'll do our best to get to as many of you as possible. We're excited to be hosting this call today. You may have seen in our press release announcing this call that we've made a process change to have a live earnings call with executives in conjunction with our fourth quarter results going forward. It feels appropriate that we share our thoughts as we wrap up one year and begin another. Also, this timing is well spaced from our June and October meetings. We plan to follow our typical earnings release process for other quarters during our fiscal year. Now before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Please review our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew approximately 3% both in the quarter and for the full year. We reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2018 for the first time as a company. For the quarter, Walmart U.S. delivered strong comp sales growth of 2.6% due primarily to improved comp traffic growth in stores of 1.6%. Strength was broad-based across merchandising categories, formats and regions, and holiday sales were solid. In addition, comp store inventory declined again for the 11th consecutive quarter so we're well positioned as we begin the year. Sam's Club comps improved to 2.4%, and in International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we were pleased with most aspects of the quarter and confident in the foundational aspects of the business as we enter this new fiscal year. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 50% in the third quarter. The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition, as well as created a healthier long-term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth. Overall, we finished the year with eCommerce sales growth of more than 40%, so we feel better about the year than the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect eCommerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the New Year with about 40% growth for the year. We're confident in our strategy to transform the company, and we continue to be guided by four key objectives : make every day easier for busy families, change how we work, deliver results and operate with discipline and be the most trusted retailer. We're accelerating innovation in the business to make shopping faster and easier for our customers. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. We made good progress this past year to save busy families time and money, and we'll do more. By becoming stronger at mobile and leveraging digital capabilities, we improved in-store experiences, including our pharmacy and money services areas. We enabled Easy Reorder online. We're making the checkout experience easier with Scan & Go and also digitizing the returns process. We made acquisitions to improve our online assortment, and we're partnering with others like Google and JD in new ways. We're expanding Online Grocery in the U.S. and around the world and broadening our delivery capabilities in the U.S., China and other international markets. It's really all about providing more convenience for customers. Customers that shop across all channels are important to us. As we said in October, U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much as customers that only shop with us in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall. Online Grocery customers are a great example as they spend more with us in total once they start using the service. So we'll lean in this year by nearly doubling the number of Online Grocery locations in the U.S. We're also becoming more efficient by changing the way we work, including leveraging technology to equip and empower our associates to be successful. They now have better information, tools and training. Finally, we're always striving to earn and maintain trust. We're focused on not only helping our customers save money and live better but also on creating shared value for our business and the communities we serve. In his remarks, Brett will go over the financials and guidance. This will include an overview of the benefits of tax reform and the strategic choices we're making to further strengthen our business. Tax reform gives us the opportunity to accelerate plans for the U.S. You may have seen our announcement last month about investing some of the proceeds in better wages and benefits for more than 1 million U.S. hourly associates. We'll also continue to lower prices for customers, improve technology in our business and accelerate grocery delivery in the United States. Now let's get into more details for the segments, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong year of top line growth, and we're seeing signs that the productivity loop is turning. In our stores, we're making shopping easier and equipping associates to serve customers more efficiently. In the fourth quarter, we took steps to restructure our store leadership teams and corporate support areas to be more nimble. We're becoming more efficient, and it's contributing to the expense leverage that physical stores have delivered all year. Beginning this week, we increased the U.S. starting hourly wage rate to $11. We're also proud to announce adoption benefits for associates that went into effect earlier this month in addition to expanded paid parental leave for all associates that will take effect in March. Investing in our associates will help us attract and retain talent in the future. In addition, we've invested in nearly 200 training academies that have further developed the retail skills of more than 250,000 associates. So our stores are executing better. We\u2019re innovating more. We\u2019re lowering prices and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic. As I mentioned earlier this has also been a year of good progress in ecommerce. We launched free 2-day shipping on Walmart.com, and customers continue to love Online Grocery pickup. We're expanding our test of same-day and next-day delivery, and our Walmart.com assortment has grown to nearly 75 million SKUs. Acquisitions like Bonobos and ModCloth bring unique, private-branded products to our shopping experience. In addition, partnerships like the agreement with Lord & Taylor will help create specialty experiences that complement our own assortment with more brands customers want. Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, is and has been the key driver of our eCommerce growth and that will continue. The Jet brand over indexed with higher-income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition, and we intend to build on that strength going forward. The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets. Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in early days but it will be well positioned where we've chosen to focus the brand. We'll continue to evaluate ourselves on the total U.S. eCommerce growth number. Moving to Sam's Club. You'll remember that we made a decision to close 63 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. We've talked about transforming the Sam's business, and part of this transformation means managing the club portfolio to include clubs that are both financially viable and that fit within the strategic framework for the future. Closing stores and clubs is difficult. It's obviously difficult for our impacted associates, and there is never a good time to do with. John and the Sam's team are working to place as many of them as possible at nearby locations. These closures will help us run a healthier business. We also took additional steps recently to align resources around the initiatives that are most important to our members. We enhanced the value of the Plus membership with a free shipping proposition. We also made the decision to remove tobacco from certain clubs. In addition, Sam's Club changed its merchandising structure to encourage more expertise and continuity in buying roles. The strategy continues to come to life, and we're already seeing progress. Our International team continues to deliver consistently solid results. While Walmex led the way this year, our good performance was broad-based. In fact, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year, and 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%. To give a little more detail, Walmex comp store sales increased 6% this year, and we're really proud of how the team is combining our stores with eCommerce to deliver a convenient, seamless shopping experience. As we mentioned in our October Investment Community Meeting, there's more work to be done on the portfolio. We've set priorities, focused our - on our North American core and key growth markets, including China and India. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to wind down the Brazil first-party eCommerce business. We always want our resources aimed at winning in the most strategic places. So overall, the International segment continues to make steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and eCommerce. In conclusion, we have a plan that leverages our unique assets and strengths to benefit customers and shareholders. It's resulting in momentum. We're being disciplined about cost and capital, and we're acting faster as a company but are pushing to increase our speed. Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Brett, you want to pick up there? Brett Biggs : All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33 and $4.42 for the fiscal year. GAAP EPS of $0.73 for the fourth quarter and $3.28 for the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a number of discrete items totaling $0.60 and $1.14, respectively. Most of these items position the business for more efficient growth going forward, including closing 63 Sam's Clubs locations to create a more viable fleet and healthier business. In addition, we discontinued real estate projects in the U.S., following our decision to open fewer stores and clubs, with greater emphasis on comp sales and eCommerce growth. We also completed our third bond tender of the year to take advantage of more favorable interest rates. A full reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included in today's earnings release. During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction. These were only partially offset by slightly more favorable currency exchange rates. Before we get to the results, I'd like to highlight some accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue surpassed $500 billion for the first time and increased $15.1 billion or 3.1% in constant currency. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.1%, the highest growth rate since fiscal 2009, led by traffic growth of 1.4%. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion. We made good progress on expenses, especially in Walmart U.S. stores and International. Without the discrete items mentioned in arriving at adjusted EPS, we would have leveraged expenses. Adjusted EPS increased 2%. Operating cash flow was $28.3 billion. The company returned $14.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strong working capital improvements continued. Let's move on to the quarter. We delivered a solid quarter to finish out the year as constant-currency revenue grew 3.1% to $135.1 billion. Comp sales were positive in all 3 segments with growth of 2.6% and 2.4% at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively. On a 2 year stack basis, comp sales accelerated for the third consecutive quarter for both of these segments at 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Even more encouraging is that these results were driven by strong in-store traffic. International grew net sales 2.8% in constant currency, led by strength at Walmex. Consolidated gross profit margin declined 61 basis points. Approximately two thirds of the decline was driven by price investments in certain markets and the mix effect from our growing eCommerce business. The remaining one third was driven by Sam's Club inventory markdowns associated with closures and other International items, including the wind down of our Brazil first-party eCommerce business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we'll continue to make investments that will pressure the rates some but not to the extent of this quarter. Similar to our full year results, SG&A and operating income were significantly impacted by charges for discrete items. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have decreased less than 1%. Let's move on to U.S. eCommerce. As Doug mentioned, the slowdown in growth during the quarter was a bit more than we planned. Looking ahead, we have a number of new initiatives planned for the year. We expect eCommerce growth to increase from the Q4 level as we enter the New Year, with about 40% growth for the year. Now let's discuss the results for each operating segment during the quarter, beginning with Walmart U.S. The U.S. team continued to produce strong top line growth. Customers are responding well to our everyday low prices and the convenience we're providing through a variety of initiatives. All store formats had positive comps, and we saw strength in key categories with increased customer traffic and units. During the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 2.6%, led by traffic growth of 1.6%. Comp sales performance on a 2 year stack was the best in 8 years, and eCommerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to the segment. Gross margin rate declined 50 basis points in the quarter due primarily to price investments, higher transportation expenses and mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Also, the team leveraged operating expenses slightly even when considering adjustments for discrete items in both current and prior year periods. Overall, we like the momentum we see in Walmart U.S. Our strategy is working, and customers are responding. International had another solid quarter. The teams around the world have done a nice job of delivering top line growth through a focus on price as well as strength in fresh and private brands. Growth was broad-based across the markets, and results at Walmex were particularly strong. Overall, net sales in constant currency increased 2.8% and grew 6.7% on a reported basis. Changes in currency rates benefited net sales by approximately $1.2 billion. It's also important to note the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of about $400 million when compared to last year. From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income decreased 16.1% in constant currency and 10.9% on a reported basis. As detailed in this morning's release, restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets negatively impacted operating income. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-over-year. Overall, we're pleased with the consistent performance we've seen from our International business, and we feel good about the year ahead. Sam's delivered solid top line results. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.4%, led by traffic increase of 4.3%. Tobacco negatively impacted comp sales by 120 basis points. ECommerce growth was solid and contributed 80 basis points to the comp. Also in the eCommerce space, the team recently announced the free shipping offer from SamsClub.com for Plus members. The team is moving quickly and making decisions that we believe will benefit our members and the business over time. I'll close today with guidance. As always, we have a number of assumptions on our guidance, including the economic conditions and the tax and regulatory landscape, and our largest markets remain generally consistent. You'll recall that we issued fiscal year 2019 guidance last October at our meeting for the investment community. Since that time, we made some decisions and assessed other potential opportunities to accelerate investments, particularly - primarily as a result of tax reform. Let me start with our expectations related to tax reform. Our estimates are based on available information and our current analysis regarding the application of the new law. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be 24% to 26% compared with our previous guidance prior to tax reform of 32.5%. Our global blended rate is higher than the new U.S. federal rate due to state taxes and taxes we pay outside of the U.S. In terms of cash flow, in addition to the income statement benefit from a lower U.S. tax rate, we expect an additional cash tax benefit due primarily to accelerated depreciation. Including all aspects of tax reform, we currently expect a cash benefit of around $2 billion for the year. Additionally, we are reviewing our cash positions overseas in light of the new law but have not made any decisions regarding potential repatriation. Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing on our business and other growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend, as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program back in October. We've consistently talked about investing in the business for the long term while balancing near-term results. As tax reform is taking shape, we took the opportunity to step back and assess various aspects of the business, including potential investments. We will continue to be aggressive but thoughtful to ensure we win long term. We recently announced some additional investments related to increased wages, training and benefits for our associates in the U.S. In addition to that, we'll look to accelerate investments in our customers through lower prices, and we'll make investments in technology, supply chain and eCommerce to better position the company for the future. We'll also continue to prioritize winning with customers in our grocery and fresh business, ensuring we make shopping with us simple and at a great value. At the October meeting, Doug talked about some decisions we had in the Q, but it was too early to comment further at that time. During the quarter we took several actions, including: a wind down of the first-party eCommerce business in Brazil, the closure of 63 Sam's Clubs locations in the U.S. and the decision to remove tobacco from certain locations at Sam's. These decisions impact the guidance we gave in October, particularly in regards to total sales growth, so I'll quantify the impacts and compare back to the October guidance. Let's first talk about Brazil eCommerce. We expect a headwind to sales of approximately $500 million related to the wind down of the first-party portion of the business. In terms of profit, the benefit of fewer operating losses will be largely offset by onetime costs associated with the wind down. As for Sam's, we anticipate a negative impact to sales of about $6.3 billion related to the decisions to close clubs and remove tobacco from certain locations. Additionally, recall that we sold our Suburbia business in Mexico in the second quarter of last year, and this will create a headwind in the first quarter of this year. The combined top line impact of these items will negatively impact consolidated net sales growth by about 140 basis points. And as a result, we now expect net sales growth to range between 1.5% and 2% in constant currency. Adjusting for these changes, this growth compares to the guidance of at or above 3% that we provided in October. As for comp sales, we expect growth at Walmart U.S. of at least 2%. Sam's Club comps excluding fuel and tobacco should range between 3% and 4% and flat to negative 1% when including the impact of reduced tobacco sales. We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency. Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October. On a consolidated basis, we still expect to slightly leverage expenses but not to the extent we originally planned. Excluding the impact of the reduction in Sam's Club sales, leverage would be stronger. Overall, cost management is continuing to improve across the business, and we remain pleased with the progress. As for operating margin, we expect consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 4.3% to 4.4% in constant currency, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease in operating income versus operating income this past year, adjusted for the discrete items. Considering all of these items, we expect full year EPS to be in a range of $4.75 and $5, an increase of 7% to 13% compared with adjusted EPS of $4.42 in fiscal 2018. This range represents an increase from the guidance given in October. Additional guidance is included in the materials we issued this morning, so please reference these documents as you analyze our outlook. Going forward, we're moving to an annual guidance framework with quarterly updates as warranted. We considered a number of factors when making this decision, including management's long-term view of the business, the transformation of the business, the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders and the uncertainty of the timing of investments during the year. There could be fluctuations within the quarters, but we believe EPS growth will be relatively consistent across the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. So with that, I'll close by saying thank you to our shareholders for your support of Walmart. And now I'd be happy, along with Doug, to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning, guys. And thanks for doing the call. My first question is on the e-com growth in the fourth quarter relative to next year. You mentioned some operational issues. Can you elaborate and then talk about what gives you confidence that the e-com run rate will accelerate heading into next year? Doug McMillon : Hi, Simeon. This is Doug. Happy to elaborate a bit more. First of all, I would say that, as we try to communicate in our remarks, most of that was expected and planned. As we came around the fourth quarter and looked at what we did last year promotionally, realized we're lapping Jet for sometime now, we've expected a lower growth rate. The minority of the miss that was more operational in nature that we're referring to is related to the fact that, during the seasonal spikes, seasonal inventory, think electronics, toys, gifts, things like that, came into our fulfillment centers and there was enough cube that it harmed our basic in-stock on more everyday items, and our basic in-stock for eCommerce suffered as a result. So we're learning how to deal with higher volumes and learning how to deal with a higher peak than what we had previously. But again, that was the minority of the issue. Most of this was planned and in our numbers. Brett Biggs : And Simeon, just to remind -- this is Brett. As a reminder, in October, we've guided to $11.5 billion of revenue for Walmart U.S. eCommerce, and that's just about where we came in for the year. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then if I can ask my follow-up. Brett, you mentioned you were doing the comparison with pre- and post-October guidance. So I think at that point, EBIT was supposed to be up maybe low single digits, and now it's going to be down a little bit. Can you just tell us if the entirety of that change is tax reform spending? Or is any part of it reflective of higher cost in the business in some form or another? Brett Biggs : Yes, Simeon. I still remain -- feel good about the cost management in the business, and we're making progress there. When we've given guidance back in October, we've talked about an operating income range that would be similar to where we had kind of been. So as we step back and we looked at everything, we've decided to make these investments that we talked about, and that's all included in the guidance that's there today. And so it's -- that one is a little bit tougher to compare pre and post, but when you look at the investments that we're making, that is the difference. But I feel good about the overall cost management side of the business. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Simeon. Rob, next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robbie Ohmes : Good morning, guys. Doug McMillon : Hey, Robbie. Robbie Ohmes : So a follow-up on Simeon's just - and then on gross margin. So I just wanted to get clarity on the eCommerce growth outlook. So the first question is just, where -- the confidence in the eCommerce growth going back to roughly 40%, are you seeing that already in the first quarter? And sort of what is the difference to get back to the 40% versus the fourth quarter? And then could you tie that into the gross margin outlook you gave? Maybe some thoughts on where you might be investing in price. And also, I think the guidance, Brett, was that gross margin rate would be down less in fiscal '19. So if eCommerce is going to reaccelerate to a sort of 40% type growth rate, why wouldn't we see more pressure on gross margin? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Thanks, Robbie. This is Doug. I'll start with the eCommerce question, and Brett can elaborate on it too if he would like to. We're not expecting the first quarter to go all the way to 40%. We think it'll start to ramp up from the fourth quarter to approximately 40% for the year. We're going to continue expanding our eCommerce business as it relates to food. Online Grocery's ramping up. As we've said, we're going to almost double the number of locations that do Online Grocery. That will drive eCommerce growth to a certain level. And then on top of that, we've got the activity planned for both Walmart.com and Jet. So we've got an investment plan there. We have an assortment plan and other innovations, as you saw last year, that will be occurring as we go through the year. So we think by the time we get to the end of the year and look back at the number for the total year, it will be approximately 40%. Brett Biggs : Yes. Robbie, I'll comment more on gross margin. As we've talked about before, there's a number of things that impact gross margin. Price, shrink, transportation expenses, all of that go into that. And so as we've said before, it's tough to look at gross margin quarter-to-quarter. I think you have to look at it on a longer base. And what I'd said in my comments is that we expect that next year's decrease won't be what we saw in the fourth quarter. And if you look at where we've guided operating income and the comment we've made about slightly leveraging expenses, you can kind of back into what -- a bit of what we're expecting from a gross margin perspective. So we do take into consideration the mix of the business. We'll continue to be aggressive but thoughtful on pricing, where we invest, how we invest, both in stores and eCommerce, but we'll be thoughtful about those investments. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Robbie. Rob, next question please? Operator : The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Hi, thanks. Just two clarifications and then a bigger picture question. So on the gross margin, the comment that you expect next year's decrease won't be where you were in the fourth quarter, is that including or excluding Sam's? So is that the 61 basis points or around 40? Brett Biggs : That's all in next year as far as gross margin rate. Karen Short : Okay. And then I know you kind of said that your comments on earnings growth will be - the cadence growth rate will be similar throughout the year. Is that fair to say, for U.S. comps, you don't really expect a lot of volatility throughout the year? Brett Biggs : Yes. I don't expect a lot of volatility throughout the year. Overall, for the year, we expect it to be 2% or higher, but I don't expect a lot of volatility during the year, Karen. Karen Short : Okay. And then I guess I wanted to just turn to the color in terms of acquiring customers on Walmart.com versus Jet.com. Is it -- I guess, is it fair to say then, since you're switching to, I guess, a lower-cost customer to look to acquire, is it fair to say that eCommerce losses have kind of bottomed? Is it still consistent with what you previously said that eCommerce losses have bottomed in '18? And then I guess, bigger picture, is there any color on Jet? Like do you feel as good as you have always felt in terms of the prospects for Jet and this is just pure math, it just makes more sense to go after the Walmart.com customer? Doug McMillon : Yes. Karen, this is Doug. Great questions. I think as we look at this year, we're trying to preserve flexibility as we go through the year to decide what level of investment we want to make in eCommerce as we go month to month and quarter-to-quarter. It's possible we may choose to lose a little more in eCommerce this year than we did last year, but generally speaking, we think it'd be about the same level of losses. Our visibility into picking costs, shipping costs, margin rates, the cost to acquire a customer and how the different cohorts are behaving as we make the marketing investments is really improving, and I'm excited about all the levers that are there. And we're -- we again are trying to preserve some flexibility to make choices as we go through. As it relates to the brands, Walmart is just a really well-known brand for value throughout the country. And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar. Now on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher-income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice, and that choice was made before we made the acquisition. I think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where we position it. But our thoughts before we bought it that basically become confirmed, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling, in some cases, some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com. So I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority. Karen Short : Thank you. Steve Schmitt : Rob, next question please? Unidentified Analyst : And if I could just ask\u2026 Steve Schmitt : We\u2019re limited to just one question, just to get through as many as we can, please. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Oliver Chen : Hi. Thank you. Regarding eCommerce and the road ahead, what are your thoughts on profitability and the smart baskets and pricing and how you're thinking about grocery pickup as well as supply chain in the context of bricks post clicks? And would love your thoughts on eCommerce M&A and on correlated assets as you've been quite creative about thinking about how to build this business over time? Thank you. Doug McMillon : Yes. Let's break it into pieces. This is Doug. I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic's up. We're in a really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong. Now we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned. We'll see more traction and improvement in that part of our business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex, Canada and even the U.K., which is a big part of our International business, has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want us to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's of vital strategic importance. So now let's click to eCommerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food eCommerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food eCommerce business, and that's what we're doing. Learning how to pick in-store enables Online Grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year. Now let's click to the part of the eCommerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into eCommerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an eCommerce basket, not just selling eaches. Like selling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays, not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money, but driving baskets on eCommerce is. So you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands, be more increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand. So as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment. It might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Oliver. Rob, next question please? Operator : Next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up question on gross margin. So can you talk about the 60 basis point decline in the U.S.? Where was that relative to your expectations going into the quarter? And then what aspects of those buckets moderate as you look to the upcoming year such that the gross margin degradation improves? Thank you. Brett Biggs : Yes. Chris, this is Brett. As we mentioned earlier, so the 60 basis points you mentioned was total company, and there is about third of that, that was related to the Sam's Club closures as well as the Brazil eCommerce shutdown and a couple of other things inside of International. So it was -- about third of that was onetime type items. In the U.S., again, there's just so many things that go into margin in a quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price. As you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years, and so we're now 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter. Doug McMillon : Chris, this is Doug. I'll just add that I think we're getting better at managing our price investment considering all the other investments that we're making. So Brett and I and the management team are watching eCommerce growth rates, eCommerce profitability, store traffic counts and making decisions in a relatively fast cycle on how much price to invest and where to invest it, and we're monitoring what happens when we do that. So we're just going to calibrate this thing as we go through the year. It's one of our big levers, and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after. And one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable. And the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic. And we'll manage margins just like we do the other parts of the P&L, a quarter at a time, balancing short term and long-term. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Chris. Rob, next question please? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot of taking my question. Several years ago, Walmart was ahead of the curve, investing in stores, e-com, in price, and you really saw a gain in terms of market share and your outperformance relative to a lot of other retailers. Now it seems like some of those share gains may be slowing a bit. So do you think you're seeing diminishing returns on your investments and you'll have to make even greater investments in order to outperform at the rate that you have been versus others? Doug McMillon : No. Michael, this is Doug. That's not my perception, and the data doesn't support that. When you look at our share numbers, we feel really good about them, and not only the dollar share numbers but also units. I'm specifically thinking of the U.S. business in my comment. But the tonnage moving through our stores is increasing, and I don't feel a trend shift there. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Michael. Rob, next question please? Operator : Next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And before I ask it, I concur, our data does show you guys continue to gain a lot of market share, particularly in food. But that's kind of where I want to go with my question. If we fast-forward, guys, 5 years from now and we see a substantial, I think about 60% -- 67% of your sales are either pharmacy or food, and a good portion of that becomes click-and-collect or even maybe delivered to the home, how should we think about Walmart's profitability? And have you guys done a lot of thinking on that? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Yes. Why don't we both -- I mean, you can go first, Brett. Brett Biggs : Yes. I think as, Mike -- I mean, Scott, as Doug was saying, we do spend a lot of time as a management team thinking ahead, obviously, next quarter, next year, 3 years out, 5 years out and how we manage all the pieces of our portfolio, and that includes International portfolio, Sam's Club, eCommerce, Walmart, and thinking about how we will manage as this business changes. We know it changes. The customer is changing, and we're going to stay out in front of the customer. And the great thing about our business is we have so many different ways to do that, and we -- and the diversity of our portfolio gives us more options in which to do that. And I think we sit back and we say we know where we want to be 5 years from now, 10 years from now, and there's a lot of different ways to get to that versus just one direct path. And so there's different things that we can do to manage that over time. Doug McMillon : I think the only thing I would add is that we're learning kind of the activity-based cost aspects of different paths. And I think, over time, if we could, and I think smart cart causes us to believe we might be able to, we'd like to bring the customers into this conversation and help them understand through our pricing and our communication that if you want to buy a single can of corn for under $1, there's not going to be a better, more efficient path to you than a supercenter visit. As the shape of a basket changes, food and non-food, and it goes up, and remember, Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of eCommerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you to have basket economics rather than eaches. So part of what we're trying to build with eCommerce, and I think you can see it, frankly, in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches, is that we're really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key to profitability. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Scott. Rob, Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning. I think I have a different way of asking the eCommerce and profitability question. Understanding that this is a year in which you're probably making some investments that you may not have made because of tax reform, is there anything that you learned since you spoke with us back in October that suggests it would be more expensive due to market conditions to get to 40% annual eCommerce growth than you had previously thought? Doug McMillon : No, I don't think so. Matt, my head, when you asked the question, started dividing it into food and non-food. There's nothing new on food. I think if you go back and listen to or watch our October analyst presentation where we walked through the strategy for food, all of that, even more convicted, still holds. On the non-food side, we're building a business. It's \u2013 non-food eCommerce is -- has not been our historic competency over the last few decades and the history of the company, and so we're learning something new. We're trying to build an assortment that enables a margin ultimately, and that's got components to it like attracting brands, being able to execute from a fulfillment point of view during a busy season. We've got some exciting things coming out with site redesign and other things this spring, I think, that will help us make more progress in that area. So I don't think it's that we've learned something new. I think it's a question of pace. And are the operational improvements and merchandising improvements happening? And are you investing marketing to kind of coincide with those improvements. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Matt. Rob, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi. Kate McShane : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just to drill down a little bit more on some of the questions that have been asked. I think apparel has been highlighted by several media outlets over the weekend. Can you walk us through what the overall apparel strategy is in store and online and how you're balancing national brands with private label? Doug McMillon : Sure. I'm excited about -- later this week, I'm headed down to Houston because we've got all of our store managers there and these new apparel brands that have been mentioned in the media are on the sales floor, and I hear they look great. We're focused on improving quality; still managing good, better and best; protecting opening price points, which we do such a great job of; reducing our SKU counts in apparel to improve our presentation. And we have some new fixturing in some stores that we're expanding on this year so that everything fits together, the quality of the product, the value of the product, the brand presentation of it, the ability to present it well because you have fewer SKUs and then a presentation in terms of fixturing that enables that to look fresh and new. We've got a big apparel business. It has been growing, but we have even more opportunity to grow it in store. And then online, there are numerous opportunities for us to build private brands, leverage the DNVBs of the world like Bonobos and ModCloth and maybe more in the future and attract other brands to both Walmart and Jet that will help us drive our apparel business and manage the mix. So apparel is a pretty big focus at the moment. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Kate. Next question please. Operator : Next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jeffries. Dan Binder : Hi, thanks. You've talked about accelerating certain investments, so I'm just curious if you could be a little bit more specific on what those are and whether or not there'll be any lumpiness by quarter that we should consider. I know you're giving annual guidance, but just want to make sure we consider the quarters as well. Brett Biggs : Yes. Dan, this is Brett. The investments that we're going to make are going to continue to change how we work as a company, help us continue to stay ahead of the customer, and those are going to be in the areas of technology. They're going to be in the areas of supply chain, pricing. And you can imagine, for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into a lot of things that we plan to do, and we'll be talking about those as we go throughout the year. We mentioned we think EPS growth will be pretty consistent throughout the year quarter by quarter. There could be a quarter or two where we make an investment that's different than the other quarters. And if that's the case, we would talk about that when we release earnings. But right now, I don't anticipate major changes quarter-to-quarter. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Dan. Rob, next question please. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Good morning and also thank you for doing this call. Just wanted to circle back on margins. The guidance for 4.3% to 4.4% for the year, obviously, a lot of moving parts and some acceleration in investments. So just want to confirm that your thought process is that there is an ability to find further leverage over time and expand from those levels as we look forward. And also, more specifically, for the current quarter, if you can just touch a little bit more detail regarding the transportation cost impact that you saw and what your expectations are on that particular line item going forward. Brett Biggs : Sure. Paul, appreciate it. I'll start with the operating income question. We're only giving guidance for this year coming forward. We did leverage expenses. Excluding discrete items for the year, leverage got better as we went throughout the year. So I am optimistic about the expense leverage that we're seeing in the business, particularly in International and Walmart U.S. stores, and I expect that we'll continue to see that progress. So that gives us -- we've always talked about that being better with expenses gives us more flexibility and more ways in which to hit the P&L that we would like to and do what we want to do for our customers. So that's the only guidance we're going to give, is we'll be this, this year on operating income. On transportation costs, those vary from quarter-to-quarter. As you know, gas prices -- fuel prices have gone up a little bit. In this last quarter, I think we're maybe $0.30 versus last year roughly. So that has a bearing on what we do year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, but that was the main mention of that in the fourth quarter. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Paul. The next question please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about the working capital opportunities that you see for FY '19? Obviously, you've done a great job in inventory in the U.S. Can working capital continue to be a source of cash for Walmart? Or have you harvested all the opportunity that you can? Brett Biggs : Thanks, Ben. Yes, there's always more opportunity. If Greg Foran were sitting here, he would talk about, as he goes into store by store, he still sees opportunity for us to be better, to be more efficient. Some of the technology that we've talked about and investments will continue to lead to easier ways for our associates to move goods, stock goods. So all of that helps, and all of that matters. I don't think there's ever an end to what we can do on working capital. The last 2 years have been -- to be fair, have been pretty impressive, the last couple of years, particularly on payables and the inventory side. So I think there's more room to go. I won't quantify what I think that could be, but I do believe working capital can continue to be a source of cash for Walmart going forward. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Ben. Rob, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey, guys. You've shown signs of being willing to rationalize the asset base here more recently, but, obviously, continue to invest in eCommerce. So how do you see the ROIC profile evolving over the next few years? Just curious how important stabilizing that metric is to you as you guys think about your broader priorities? Thanks. Brett Biggs : Yes, great question. And Peter, as you know, we've talked a lot about ROI. It's important to us. Returns are important, along with a number of other metrics that we've mentioned this morning. If you pull out the discrete items, ROI would have been in a much better place in this last year, and we've seen improvements in our asset base and rationalizing that operating income being where it is. Returns short term, long term are really important for the company. We are going to make sure that we win long term. And as we've said before, there may be times year-to-year where that has an impact on ROI that is different than we would want on a long-term basis. But we will make those decisions when we need to do that. But returns are very important for us, and we talk about it a lot as a management team, as you would imagine. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Peter. Rob, next question please. Operator : Next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Bob Drbul : Hi, guys. Good morning. Two quick questions. The first one is, did you give a number on inflation and sort of the trends that you're seeing on -- especially on the food inflation? And then the other one is, on fulfillment centers, you're converting, I think it's, 10 of the Sam's Clubs into fulfillment centers. Can you just give us an idea of where you think you are with your ability on the fulfillment center proposition in the business? Brett Biggs : Yes. Bob, on inflation, we didn't see a meaningful impact in the quarter. And going forward, probably a modest impact -- slight impact next year, but nothing meaningful really next year. Doug McMillon : And on the fulfillment side, I would say we're in pretty good shape in terms of square footage and where it's placed. We had these 6 fulfillment centers with Walmart, the 3 we picked up from Jet. And Marc and the team are learning how to mirror inventory in certain places to improve customer service levels and to lower cost. So that's underway, but the physical plant is in pretty good shape generally. It's going to be fun to watch what happens with the Sam's Club efforts here. If we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn, we basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those. That's going to help us with speed. It's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape. Over the years, looking ahead, as we grow the business, we may open a fulfillment center here and there, but that's where we stand today. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Bob. Rob, next question please. Operator : The next question is from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I wanted to tie it back a little into the reinvestment of the tax benefits. I think you guys have invested about $750 million in labor that was announced about a month ago. When you think about the magnitude that would go back into price, should we think about it being similar to what was in SG&A? Or how would we even frame that? And you can answer to this year or even over the next couple of years. Thanks. Brett Biggs : Yes, Greg. As I said earlier, we're not going to get into a lot of detail about how we're going to invest. The wage amount you mentioned, about $400 million of that was the onetime bonus. The other part would be going forward into next year with the increase in the start rate. And I'll say what I said before, which is we're going to be thoughtful about these investments. And we have a lot of levers that we can use to satisfy that customer, and we're going to be thoughtful about which levers we pull. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Greg. Rob, next question please. Operator : Next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Yeah, hi. Good morning. I would just like to talk about - or ask about investment in grocery at this point, just in terms of price investment, how you're thinking about the returns that you're getting on that investment, how you balance that against investing in the digital experience for the customer. I would think that, at this point, you're getting to an area, given your price perception and competitive marketplace, that maybe digital is the better return. And then you did mention grocery delivery. Could you just give us an update on where you stand there at this point? Doug McMillon : Sure. As you think about price investments in store, think about grocery, consumables and the fact that, across the store, there are some items, windshield washer fluid in the automotive department, tennis balls in sporting goods, that are high-turn, price-sensitive items to a degree. And when we think about the price investments in the store, we're not singularly focused on dry grocery. We're thinking about this in a broad way. The supercenter assortment is a big advantage, and we want to deliver low prices across the store, which also helps us drive traffic to the store and manage margins across the entire store. So evaluate the price investment through that lens rather than just grocery. And the returns we're seeing there are attractive. You can see it in the store traffic. And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the eCommerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in eCommerce. There may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on eCommerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path. We kind of watch that very continuously basically. As it relates to grocery delivery, we've had this small pilot going on with our own associates, and we'll continue to play around with that and learn what works there. But the expansion will happen through a variety of platforms. We'll use, depending on the spot in the country, different providers to get the product to the customer, and we'll be keeping an eye on NPS scores in particular. Our Online Grocery business has a really high Net Promoter Score, and we want to, as we start to grow delivery capabilities, ensure that the customer experience is as good through delivery as it is for pickup. So we've got some things to learn there, and it'll happen at a pace based on the customer experience. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Ed. Rob, we have time for one question. Operator : That final question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Doug, from a capital allocation standpoint, could you discuss a little bit about closing the 63 Sam's stores earlier? And then should we expect to see continued closings both in the U.S. and International? And then for Brett, on the digital side, could you shed some light on the growth between 1P and 3P for the e-com business? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Sure. I'll take capital allocation first. If you go back a couple of years, you'll remember that we closed quite a few stores around the world, including the 100-some-odd Express stores in Walmart U.S., the smaller stores that we have been testing as a pilot -- as a format. We discontinued those and closed those. At that moment in time, we had been through all of the 11,600-plus units around the world, sitting through real estate, meeting, Brett, country by country and making choices about the portfolio. So we did a lot of that cleanup then. We didn't do Sam's Club at the time. We were still working through a number of things, pacing things out, trying to put them in the right sequence. So the way I was thinking of it is let's make sure that the U.S. store business is strong. What do we need to make that work? That's where we made wage investments, price investments and cleaned up the portfolio. We've been focused on -- focusing on building an eCommerce business. That's still underway obviously. And then now we've turned our attention to Sam's Club. We've got a strategy we believe in, a leadership team we're excited about, and we're investing in that business to drive comps up there. So it's just been a sequencing, and the bottom line is we've been through the portfolio. I can't tell you there will never be more closings. A store here and there, I think, makes sense, but we've been through the majority of that big work for now anyway. Brett Biggs : Chuck, on your question of 1P and 3P, obviously, first part, they're part - they're both important to us. We want to satisfy that customer need. Sometimes, it's better done through first party; sometimes, it's better done through third party. As you know, we have about 75 million SKUs now on our Marketplace site. And it's another one of those levers that we've talked about -- I was talking about earlier that we have in order to determine how we best fulfill that customer need in a way that makes sense for both top line and bottom line. Steve Schmitt : Well, thanks, guys. We certainly appreciate you joining our call today. And have a great day. Brett Biggs : Thank you all. Doug McMillon : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

It's my honor as Chair of the Walmart Board of Directors, to welcome you and formally open our 48th Annual Shareholders' Meeting. As you know, we're taking a new approach to the format of our meeting this year. To ensure a productive and orderly meeting, we've established some rules of conduct. We ask that you review and follow these procedures that were being handed out as you arrived at the meeting. If you need any assistance locating that information, please ask one of the ushers. The Inspectors of Election today are from Broadridge Financial Solutions. Based on their report, we have a forum and may proceed with the business portion of the meeting. Therefore, the meeting is now officially called to order. The polls are open and they will remain open until approximately 10 :40 a.m. Only shareholders who held their shares before close of business on April 6, 2018 or their proxy-holders are entitled to vote shares. If you have not voted your shares or wish to change your vote, raise your hand and the ushers will pass you a ballot. As I've discussed before, we've made a number of changes at the Board level that reflect the approach we're taking throughout our Company. We've deepened our expertise in technology, we've optimized the number of Board seats, and we've made process improvements to be nimbler in our deliberations and our decision making. We also continue to have strong independent voices. 7 out of our 11 nominees today are independent. I'd like to take a few moments to introduce our directors. I'll first recognize the directors, who're up for reelection which includes myself. I'd like to ask and to stand as I call their names and to keep standing. The Chair of our Audit Committee retired KPMG Chairman, Tim Flynn; Vice Chairman of Morgan Stanley, Carla Harris; Former American Airlines Chairman and CEO, Tom Horton, Tom will become our lead Independent Director upon his reelection as a director at this meeting; Marissa Mayer, Former CEO of Yahoo and the Co-Founder of Lumi Labs, a technology incubator focused on consumer internet technologies; Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon; the Chair of our Compensation and Management Development Committee, former PepsiCo Chairman and CEO, Steve Reinemund, who unfortunately couldn't join us today; Founder of RZC Investments, Steuart Walton; and of course my predecessor as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Rob Walton. Thank you all for your willingness to continue to serve, and please be seated. Now, I'd like to introduce one new independent member who joined our Board by appointment in February. She's now standing for election for the first time, Sarah Friar. Sarah is currently the CFO of Square, and she brings to our Board deep expertise in finance, operations and strategy with entrepreneurial technology companies. Sarah, we're excited to have you on our Board. We also have one other new independent member Steve Easterbrook. Steve has been the President and CEO of McDonald\u2019s since 2015. He unfortunately couldn't join us today, but we look forward to his perspective and expertise. Stepping off the Board and not standing for reelection are two directors, who have made significant contributions to our Company. First, Kevin Systrom is the co-Founder and CEO of Instagram. Go ahead, Kevin, stand up. Kevin has brought an entrepreneur's perspective in technology expertise to the Board. He served as the Chair of our Technology and eCommerce Committee since 2015. Thank you, Kevin. Dr. Jim Cash, please stand, is the other director who is stepping off the Board. Dr. Cash is the James E. Robison, Professor of Business Administration Emeritus at Harvard Business School. He served on our Board for 12 years including as our lead Independent Director since 2013. He's also served as Chair of our Nominating and Governance Committee since it was formed in January of 2017. Dr. Cash has worked diligently with us over the past several years on the many changes to our Board governance and processes. Thank you, Jim. I now I speak for everyone on the Board when I say that we have tremendous confidence in our senior management team. Here now to share with us an update on the Company's strategy is that team's leader Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to have a few minutes to talk to you about what we are doing at Walmart and where we are ahead. We had an exciting year and we are moving faster, getting stronger and we have good momentum across many parts of the business. This is a dynamic time to be in retail, and opportunities are emerging to serve customers in new ways. So, we are moving with speed to bring them to life. We're working hard to set the Company up for success whether that's in our core operations, investing in Flipkart in a growth market like India or in our desire to combine Asda business with Sainsbury's in the UK. We continue to be strategic and thoughtful about our portfolio. At the same time, we manage our business to deliver results today. We're making big changes and they are the right changes to deliver long-term growth. Last fiscal year, we reached more than $500 billion in revenue. For the first time as a company. Walmart U.S. delivered the highest comp sales growth in nine years and U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%. Walmart International had 10 of 11 markets post positive comp sales for the year and five of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales have also been positive and traffic has improved for four consecutive quarters. We have a strong foundation and great opportunities to better serve our customers and members. Let me quickly take you through our strategy. As you know, our purpose is to help people save money and live better, and our strategy gives us priorities for how we do that. The first objective is to make everybody easier for busy families. We're focused on making shopping easy at Walmart, fast, friendly and fun. We want to save customers not only money but time, and that's why we're creating seamless shopping with a great in-store experience, easy pickup, fast delivery and apps and websites that are simple to use. Technology is also a big influence on our next objective, which is changing how we work. We're becoming a more digital company. And our goal is to make the most of technology to move faster, to be more efficient and effective. Changing how we work also means strengthening our diversity and inclusion efforts. In addition to being the right thing to do, there is a strong business case for diversity and helps us deliver innovation within the Company. Our next goal is to deliver results and operate with discipline. We are focused on strong, efficient growth as we manage expenses and capital wealth. Our last goal is to be the most trusted retailer that means having the right people, processes and technology in place when it comes to compliance and ethics. Earning trust also means creating shared value for business and society. The ways we're making a difference include things like Project Gigaton, an initiative with suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. It also means being there when disasters strike, such as the devastating hurricanes last year. We want our customers to feel good about shopping with us, we also want our associates to feel proud to work at Walmart, and we want our shareholders to be pleased for having invested with us. If we keep delivering on this strategy, we think you'll be pleased with the results and proud of the company that you've invested in. Thank you for your interest in Walmart. And now, please allow me to introduce Rachel Brand, she is the newest member of our executive leadership team. She is the Executive Vice President of Global Governance and Corporate Secretary. She will take us through the proposals. Please welcome Rachel. Rachel Brand : Thank you, Doug. We'll now proceed to the formal business portion of the meeting. There are six matters to be brought before the meeting today. And I'll take you through them in the order in which they appeared in the agenda. Only those six items, if properly presented, will be voted on today. As a reminder, no one is permitted to address the meeting unless recognized by Greg Penner, our Chairman or by me as Walmart's Corporate Secretary. The first item of business is the election of 11 directors. Greg has already introduced to you each of them and there is more information about them in our proxy statement. The second item is an advisory vote to approve the compensation of Walmart's named executive officers. Walmart's executive compensation program is designed to reward performance and to align the interest of our executives with the interests of our shareholders. This vote is only advisory but the Board will consider the results as they review our executive compensation program. The third item is the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young as the Company's independent accountants for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019. Two shareholder proposals appeared in the Company's 2018 proxy statement. The Company's responses also appear in the proxy statement. In a moment, I'll recognize individuals to present each of those proposals. And I'll ask each of those individuals to stick to your minutes of allotted time and to refrain from speaking on matters unrelated to the proposal. The first proposal requests that Walmart adopt a policy that the Chairman be independent. Ms. Anne Kyle [ph] who represents the International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund will present this proposal. Ms. Kyle? Unidentified Company Representative : Hello, everyone. Mr. Chairman, my name is Anne Kyle [ph] and I'm presenting proposal number 4 on the proxy submitted by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund. The proposal seeks what we believe to be a fundamental element of best practice corporate governance, a policy where in the Chairman of the Board must be an independent director. The definition of independent is important, especially at Walmart where shareholders have never had independent leadership of the Board of Directors. The Fund believes the Board Chair should be a Director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the Company and who is independent of management. For these purposes, a director shall not be a considered independent if during the last three years, he or she has not been a part of management, not a part of the founding family of Walmart, not someone with a business or some type of service relationship with the Company or management and not part of a director interlock. An Independent Chair who sets agendas, priorities, and procedures for the Board can enhance its oversight and accountability of management and ensure the objective functioning of an effective Board. We view the alternative of a lead outside director even one with a robust set of duties as adequate only in exceptional circumstances fully disclosed by the Board. Human capital management remains a challenge. The Company is the largest private employer on earth yet no Director has disclosed expertise in human capital management. An Independent Chair would be better positioned to lead the necessary Board renewal process. Several respective institutions recommend chair independence. CalPERS\u2019 Corporate Core Principles and Guidelines state that the independence of the majority of the Board is not enough. The leadership of the Board must embrace independence and it must ultimately change the way in which directors interact with management. We urge you to vote for this proposal. Thank you. Rachel Brand : Thank you, Ms. Kyle [ph]. We appreciate your viewpoint. The second shareholder proposal requests that the company prepare a report on racial or ethnic pay gaps. Ms. Arianna Smith, who represents the organization United for Respect will present this proposal. Ms. Smith. Arianna Smith : This proposal says, Resolved, shareholders must request Walmart prepare a report, omitting proprietary information and prepared at reasonable cost demonstrating the Company does not have any racial or ethnic pay gaps. For purposes of this proposal, a racial or ethnic pay gap exists when one or more particular jobs or statuses, management, part-time work are disproportionately occupied by persons of a particular racial or ethnic group, compared to the composition of the workforce as a whole; or persons of one racial or ethnic group are compensated differently from persons of another racial or ethnic group performing the same job under the same description, with the same experience and level of performance. Good morning. My name is Arianna Smith, and I'm an hourly Walmart associate in Barstow, California. I like working at Walmart because I really like helping my community and making customers smile. But as a part time employee, it is struggle to make ends meet. I was hired working fulltime to help open our store, but after a couple of months, they moved me to part time without any warning. Now, I only bring about $200 a week home before taxes and it's a struggle to pay my rent and to put food on my table. Over half a million Walmart associates work part time and like me many want full time hours. But instead of giving associates additional hours, management at my store is hiring more and more part time people. In fact, a survey by the organization United for Respect found that 69% of all part time associates are in voluntary part time. Like me, they would rather work full time, and for Black, Latin and Asian associates at Walmart, this number was even higher. One way I have tried to get more hours is to get cross-trained to do money services or customer service work, but my managers never give me the time to do these online training. At my store, it seems like managements decisions on who gets more hours or full time jobs are not based on merit but rather who their friends are. Favoritism should have no place in our stores. But too often, managers are picking and choosing who gets ahead. We also know that at Walmart, managers are disproportionately white and male. This is why I believe it's essential for Walmart to be transparent and fair. Tell us if women and people of color are disproportionately stuck in part time jobs. Tell us if women are paid less than men. And please vote yes on this proposal. Tell us if black and Latin associates are paid less than white associates. Mr. McMillon, you said that Walmart is committed to a new era of trust and transparency. So, why wouldn't you want to make sure that Walmart is fair for all? Thank you. Rachel Brand : Thank you, Ms. Smith, we appreciate your view points and your service as an associate. Lastly, as noted in the Other Matters section of our proxy statement. Ms. Girline Mazarin, [ph] representing Ms. Janie Grice will present the proposal concerning our share repurchase programs and a corresponding distribution of shares to our U.S. associates., Ms. Mazarin? [ph] Unidentified Company Representative : Resolved: Shareholders call on the Board of Directors to ensure that for every dollar that the Company spends on stock buyback, the Company shall grant an equal amount to the Associate Stock Purchase Plan for the purchase of the sales to be distributed evenly among plan participant based on the number of hours among the company U.S. workforce. For 2018 and 2019, there is $18.8 billion authorized for stock buyback. So that will mean granting over $12,000 in stock for our 1.5 million associates. Good morning. My name is Girline Mazarin [ph]. I'm a current hourly associate at store 3397. I'm also a Haitian immigrant and single mom. I moved at Florida to pursue a better life for myself and my daughter. I started at Walmart at 2016 after seeing online ad how well Walmart treats its customers. Like many at Walmart, I'm stuck in part-time work. Even though I'm available to work additional hours and I have asked multiple times for a full-time position, my schedule is always random. So, it's impossible to get a second job or to pick up my daughter after school. Even after Walmart wage increased to $11, I cannot afford to pay my dues. To make ends meet, I visit the loan centers to get cash advances and I pay $22 each time. Walmart got billion in taxing saving this year but they only raise our wages a tiny bit. The majority of the benefit went to the Walton family who are the richest family in the world. Walmart plans to give $20 billion to shareholders through stock buyback over the next three years. A new study found that with that money you could boost hourly wages well over 11 -- I'm sorry, $15 an hour. No offense to the Walton family, but you don't need more money. It's time to invest in associates. Sam Walton said, the more you share your profit with your associates, the more profit will accrue to the Company. Our wages are way behind a company like Costco and they are doing better for investors than Walmart is. And our competitor Target has already committed to be $15 an hour, while we are still only at $11. Our stores [ph] make Walmart profitable and give an advantage over retailers, but we need more hours. So, we can take good care of our customers and our own family. Walmart is not making any long term investment in associates. That's our\u2026 Rachel Brand : Your time has expired. Please wrap up. Unidentified Company Representative : Almost done, please. Listen to Mr. Sam. Share your profit with us. It's time for a change. Thank you. Rachel Brand : Thank you, Ms. Mazarin. [ph] We appreciate your perspective as well. There are no further matters to be presented before the meeting. And so, I will now turn the chair back over to our Chairman, Greg Penner. Greg Penner : Thank you, Rachel. And it's great to have you onboard. At this time, I can now inform you that the polls have closed. If you have filled out a ballot and have not handed it in, please pass it to an usher. We will now announce the unofficial preliminary voting results from today's meeting. Proposal number one, election of directors. All 11 director nominees were elected. Proposal number two, a non-binding advisory resolution to approve the compensation of Walmart's named executive officers, this proposal was approved by a majority vote. And proposal number three, the appointment of Ernst & Young as Independent Accountants, this proposal was also approved by majority vote. Proposals four through six did not receive their required votes and therefore each of them failed. We will issue an announcement later today with the approximate voting percentages for each of these proposals and we will provide a recap of the voting results again at our gathering in Fayetteville on Friday. The official results for each proposal will be disclosed in a filing next week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Let me close the meeting by saying thank you to our shareholders for their support of our company. Your Board is confident we are well positioned to deliver the future of retail. The business portion of our meeting is now adjourned. Thank you everyone.",

A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Dan Binder with Investor Relations. Mr. Binder, you may begin. Dan Binder : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; and Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide their view on the fourth quarter, our outlook for fiscal year 2020 and discuss progress on our strategic initiatives. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Now before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're encouraged by our performance for the year, because we believe our customers are noticing our improvements but we continue to see many ways we can serve them better. We're even more convinced they want us and expect us to bring our stores and eCommerce business together, an additionally connected seamless way that make shopping easier. We experienced a favorable economic environment in the U.S. for much of the year and our associates made a lot happen to draw the strength of our results. Brett will go into more detail on our results shortly. I am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter. In Q4, Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 4.2% excluding fuel, eCommerce sales increased 43% and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys, according to Nielsen and the NPD Group. Sam's Club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5.3% excluding fuel and tobacco. And in international, comps were positive in the majority of our markets. Strong top line results allow us to reiterate the FY'20 sales and profit guidance we gave in October, even as we landed FY'19 ahead of where we expected. We strive to make every day easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time. Part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths, such as having a broad assortment including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we're using technology to change how we work. More customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it's important that we engage them in different ways. We've learned that those customers who shop with us, both in stores and online, spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores. Across the business, you can see examples of how we're meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement. In the U.S. we offer grocery pick up at more than 2100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations, which represents about 69% and 36% of the population respectively. Feedback from customers about these services continues to be very positive, which speaks of the capabilities of roughly 37,000 personal shoppers. In Mexico, we're delighting customers with new experiences such as a secured digital payment option. It's available on their mobile phones and in-store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times. In addition, through our investment in the crowdsourced Delivery Platform Dada-JD Daojia, customers in China get their merchandise in less than an hour of placing the order and it's picked from a network of more than 280 locations. We continue to build trust which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage. Around the world, Walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good. Whether it's our work to promote small businesses and local farmers in places like, India or a larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in U.S. by 2025. Customers can feel good about Walmart. The company that starts everyday with a goal of earning their business. It's nice to be recognized for the work we're doing to promote shared value. In fact, the company recently received an A minus rating on the CDP's annual environmental scorecard, up from a B rating last year. And we're ranked as the survey's top-performing U.S. based food retailer. Shared value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital, deliver strong efficient growth, reduce costs and operate with discipline. Within this construct; customers, associates, communities and shareholders can win. Now let's move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. where the team had a great year. Comp sales growth of 3.6% for fiscal year 2019 exceeded our expectations. The work that team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive. The team leveraged operating expenses overall, even as we invested in wages, training, technology and eCommerce. Store level productivity is strong, due in part to the training we are providing our associates. As the nature of work continues to change, we're innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills, thriving their jobs and growing their careers. This coming year, we'll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options including through advances in technology and the gamification of educational experiences. Overall I'm pleased with what I see operationally and with our merchandizing. The investments we're making in our people, remodels, and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate, fast, friendly, and fun to shop. Having a great store or site starts with having great merchandise. In our stores, you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands. We're also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys. We are making progress in eCommerce. Our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise. We're expanding our assortment, improving search enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews, inventory mirroring, and on-time delivery to accomplish this. And of course, we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products. Sales in eCommerce increased 40% for the year. We will continue to play off and innovate as we shape the future of our omni retail. This includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery. Our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems, plus our acquisitions are helping us drive strong sales, but we need to make more progress to improve profitability. Our fulfillment shipping costs were improving as we continue to enhance our assortment, repeat visits should increase and contribute to improved profitability. We might get progress during the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with Lord & Taylor, Ellen DeGeneres, Advance Auto, Sofia Vergara, and Fanatics to name a few. These initiatives are contributing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index, as well as NPS which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year. Many opportunities exist, mainly driven by data and we'll look to leverage our unique assets and capability better, than we do today. At Sam's Club, the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people, products, and working in a more digital way. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comp sales for the year increased 5.7% and eCommerce sales grew 27%. When someone downloads the app, shops on samsclub.com, or uses our Scan & Go, they're more likely to renew. We're encouraged by the trends we see in membership. As of year-end, we saw improvements in signups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to what it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10% of the fleet. In international, eight of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year, including the four major markets and overall sales increased 2.9% in constant currency. It's been a big year for International as we run the business while shaping the portfolio. Walmex continues to be strong. The improvements we're making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in NPS in each of our formats. Similar to the U.S., we're now leveraging our store base to offer same-day delivery. We recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5,000 general merchandise items to this service. We continue to invest in our stores and in eCommerce to build an omni-channel experience, tailored to customers in this market. Our business in Canada also continues to perform well. The team's moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omni-channel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets. For example, we've entered into new partnerships this year in cities like Toronto and Vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise. In the UK, Brexit and the potential implications of a hard Brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone. No matter the situation, Asda will always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers. I visited our team in the UK a few weeks ago and I'm really impressed with their performance, their attitudes and the leadership. They're amazing. In India, we remain optimistic about the eCommerce opportunity given the size of the market. The low penetration of eCommerce and the retail channel and the pace, at which it's growing. In the future, we hope to work with the government for pro-growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers, farmers and suppliers to benefit from it develop and prosper. In terms of the regulatory environment, we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation, but the team has worked to ensure that we're in compliance with the new rules. We are committed to providing sellers with a world-class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service. We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field. Turning to China, we continue to see significant growth opportunities. Overall, we've identified provinces that are priority for us and we're improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as a new store designs and omni-channel initiatives. Uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment, but I like the things we're doing to position ourselves in this important market. Across international, we're accelerating omni-channel capabilities with the farthest along in China due to the partnership with JD.Com, our relationship with Tencent and the investments we've made in Last Mile delivery. We're also accelerating omni growth in Canada, Mexico, Chile and Japan through partnerships and acquisitions. International team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe. In closing, let me say how pleased I am about all that we've accomplished over the last year and how excited I'm about what's still to come. We see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and eCommerce but we have more work to do as customers raise their expectations, competition persist, and the omni retail story continues to evolve. We fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next five years versus the last five years with emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further and we're adapting. But we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality.  We will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive. Within our ecosystem, we will pursue to grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to other that can generate new revenue streams. Our commitment to the customers is clear. We'll be there when where and how they want to shop. Our distinctive set of assets, financial strength, and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely Walmart. Brett you want to pick it up there. Brett Biggs : You bet. Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. I'm excited to talk about our results this morning. Walmart had a really good year and we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as well. We have momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan which we believe is the winning formula long-term. I'll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue and constant currency was just over $515 billion and increased $14.8 billion or 3%. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 3.6%, the highest annual growth rate in 10 years. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 40% nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past two years. We made a number of strategic choices to position Walmart International for success including the acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in Brazil. We made progress on expenses and are particularly proud of the leverage in Walmart U.S. stores. Excluding discrete items from last year, we leverage total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year. Adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.91, operating cash flow was strong at $27.8 billion, and the company returned $13.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We're pleased with what we've accomplished, but not satisfied. This year and quarter are further proofs that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near-term results while positioning the business for the longer term. We're leveraging our scale, unique assets, and financial strength in ways others can't. Now, let's move on to the fourth quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter topline growth; the total constant currency revenue grew 3.1% to $140.5 billion with currency having a negative effect of approximately $1.7 billion. Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 4.2% was a bit better than expected as strong holiday results and early release of government assistance benefited sales. International grew net sales 2.7% in constant currency led by strength at Walmex and Sam's Club had solid comp sales growth of 5.3% excluding fuel and tobacco. Consolidated gross margins, gross profit margin declined 21 basis points, due primarily to the mix effect from e-commerce growth in India and the U.S. and price investments in certain markets. We had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year's discrete items. SG&A leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year's discrete items, but was partially offset by dilution from Flipkart. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have increased slightly on a constant currency basis. The adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24.6%. As a reminder, the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in jd.com, adjustments related to the tax reform, and the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil. For the fourth quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 22.8% and benefited EPS by about $0.04 per share, primarily due to the effect of the numerous federal tax regulations issued late in Q4. Adjusted EPS increased 6% to $1.41 and GAAP EPS was $1.27. Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. continued to have greater sales momentum. Comp sales excluding fuel grew 4.2% in the quarter and 6.8% on two-year stack basis. The best result in nine years. We started the quarter with strong Thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales. Although bases sales were strong, we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early SNAP funding. Clearly, we're operating in a healthy consumer environment, but our integrated omni offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season. We had solid traffic and ticket up 0.9% and 3.3% respectively, while eCommerce sales grew 43% and contributed approximately 180 basis points of segment comp. We're encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to Nielsen and The NPD Group. Our strong mid-single digit comp growth in grocery led to the best tier stack in nine years. Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit comp sales gain and general merchandise comp sales were up mid-single digit percentage with a strong holiday performance in toys and seasonal categories. Our inventory position is good as we enter the New Year. In Walmart U.S. eCommerce, we've made good progress on a number of initiatives as Doug mentioned. We are still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long-term profit profile we want. The team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel, which will help margin rate as well simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions. As we outlined in October, we expect our losses in eCommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure, people, online grocery and store number 8 initiatives. While we've made good progress against our strategy in recent years, we still have great opportunity in front of us. We remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same day grocery delivery in the coming year, while also adding grocery pick up to another 1000 stores. The boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur and we're in a great position to capitalize on that. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of eCommerce growth pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses. Expense leverage was strong reflecting strong sales increased productivity and overlap from last year's discrete items. The Walmart U.S. stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive eight consecutive quarters even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year. Operating income increased by more than 7% during the quarter. Overall, we're really pleased with the momentum we have in the Walmart U.S. business. Moving to International. Net sales in constant currency increased 2.7%, but declined 2.3% on a reported basis due to the negative currency effects of approximately $1.7 billion. The deconsolidation of Brazil was a self head wind offset by the inclusion of Flipkart sales for full quarter. Our major markets was saw positive comps from Walmex Canada and the U.K. Results in Mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter and we continue to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories including food and staples according to ANTAD. In the U.K. Asda's progress on improving the value proposition growing online grocery share and expanding private label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps. In China, we saw slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the Mid-Autumn Festival and a slower economic environment effected sales growth. Without the calendar shift comp sales would have been positive. As expected, international operating income declined 2.8% in constant currency and 9.9% on reported basis. Factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from Flipkart partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year's discrete charges. Flipkart's results were in line with our expectations. Overall, very pleased with the progress being made in Walmart International. Sam's Club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3.3% excluding fuel and 5.3% when excluding fuel and tobacco. The transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and eCommerce sales grew 21%. We're seeing improved membership sign-ups and NPS scores. And in fact, despite closing 10% of our clubs at the end of last year, overall membership counts are about flat year-over-year. Sam's operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year's discrete charges for club closures. Excluding these items, operating income would have been flat. Excluding fuel and up about 9% with fuel. I'll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020. As always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including the economic conditions, currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent. As always, we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in JD.Com. We're also continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions. As we mentioned in October, we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind. Regarding Flipkart, with any change like this, there can be some disruption to the business, but we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption. There'll be some additional costs to comply with the new regulations, but we don't currently believe they will be significant enough to impact total company guidance for the year. You'll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 guidance last October, while there's been some growing uncertainty in the overall macro-economic and political environment, we're confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate. We finished the year with good momentum. So today we're reiterating the previous guidance provided in October, which speaks to the consistency of our business. I'll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning's press release. I'll start with sales guidance. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3% on a constant-currency basis in FY'20. With the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half, due to some timing and comparison, including the deconsolidation of Brazil and the addition of Flipkart. Keep in mind, on a reported basis, we've seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results. If the current spot rates were to continue into next year, there will be currency headwind to reported sales of around $3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year. For Walmart U.S., we still expect comp store growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the more difficult comparisons. We expect the quarterly cadence of comp store growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year, ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in any given quarter. Walmart U.S. eCommerce is expected to grow sales around 35% in FY'20 and we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30% to below 40% range. We still expect the leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in FY'20. We'll continue to make progress on being more efficient at lowering cost, especially in Walmart U.S. stores, where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points, due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity.  On a consolidated basis, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year. Timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter-to-quarter versus our expectations. Turning to profitability, we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single digit percentage, primarily due to Flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019. We would expect operating income to increase excluding the Flipkart effects. We expect EPS to decline by low single digit percentage which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% to 27.5%. Keep in mind that increase in the rate relative to FY'19 adjusted tax rate relates to the Flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term which we've mentioned previously. Excluding the full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart, we would expect EPS to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage. As you would expect, the quarterly year-over-year change in operating income and EPS will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of Flipkart only being in our results in part Q3 and all of Q4 last year. We currently expect operating income and EPS to decrease by around 10% in Q1 decrease by a low to mid-single digit percentage in Q2 and Q3 and increase in Q4 to achieve our full year guidance. As always, the growth quarter-to-quarter can change due to timing and other factors. Our priorities for capital allocation remains unchanged. We'll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we continue with our current share repurchase program. Before I close, I want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors. Similar to the past, we will host the question-and-answer session in Northwest Arkansas in June in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting. However, instead of hosting an investment community meeting in October as we typically have, we plan to have an event in February 2020 in New York in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. This meeting will be similar to the format we typically had, where you'll hear updates on our performance, guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders but a location that's closer to many of you. As always, we'll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts. Let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company. I'm as optimistic as I have ever been about what Walmart can become. It's a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win. And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  And our first question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My first question is on expense leverage. You mentioned the 20 basis points, and I think you just clarified in your comments Brett it's total company. So, can we dig a little bit more into what's driving it? And if we back into gross margin, then within the context of your overall guidance that implies gross margins will be down. And so my question is, if gross margin pressure is, let\u2019s say more acute than you expect how much flexibility do you have on the expense line over the course of the year? Brett Biggs : Thanks, Simeon. We talked a lot over the last few months about -- last few quarters about expense leverage. It comes from a number of different places. We've seen great expense leverage in the U.S., certainly good comp sales helps a lot with that. But as the technology and the training that we've done in the past -- technology put in place and the training we've done in the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers. So, as you saw even in October, some of the technology that's coming something we keep doing with our stores, we expect the productivity in the U.S. stores will continue to be a big part of what we do. When you look at really around the world, we're seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets. As you know with leverage, it could be a lot of small things that add up, but we're doing some bigger things as well. I talked recently about the work we're doing in shared services that we're viewing that as more of a real strength of the company. This past year, we hired a Chief Procurement Officer for the first time for goods, not for resale, so we're putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage.  So, I feel good about the numbers we've put out, and I think there's going to be room for us. The timing of that is always challenging to figure out. You're correct on gross margin, and that's the implication that we have. We're going to continue to invest in price for the customer, which we've done. The mix of the business will continue to change, which changes a bit the nature of our company, and we've always said a couple of things : One is getting our expenses right allows us to do what we need to do from a gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers. And so, that's the main think we want to do with expenses. And we have a lot of leverage to pull as a company, and then we can make changes throughout the year. Hope, I answered your question, Simeon. Simeon Gutman : Yes, yes. So, my follow-up with regards to eCommerce and online. And I think Doug made a comment around profitability and maybe repeat customer purchases, and I think you did as well Brett. So look, it's taking longer than -- it sounds like it's taking longer than you think to get to profitability. I think we know that already, but can you talk about what's been the biggest surprise. Is it, you're making less on the consumables mix than you thought, you're just not seeing enough long tail yet. I think Doug insinuated, we should make progress on the repeat rate, I assume that means it's not as strong as you think. Is it costing you more to run these mega DCs? Any more clarity on what line of progress we need to see the most on to get to that profitability. Doug McMillon : Yes, Simeon, this is Doug. I think the headline answer is it\u2019s mix, and that mix has got to generate a customer experience that drives repeat business. So if you break it down into pieces, we\u2019ve got this advantage of having the stores and fresh and perishables in the assortment of supercenters close to customers, we're trying to drive that advantage and I believe we've got good traction there. In parallel, we're trying to build an eCommerce business. In apparel, general merchandise you saw recently a new home launch from us with the brand Modern, for example. Trying to build an apparel home hard lines business that brings customers back and generates a positive contribution margin for the basket.  And there are different components of that basket. There's the pick cost, the shipping cost, and then just the gross margin on the products. And the thing that's taking longer than what I would have guessed is to build that merchandise assortment including the brands that we're trying to add to a place where we got a repeatable healthy mix of business online. So we're pedaling fast trying to make that happen and disappointed that it's taken us long as it has. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Proceed with your question. Bob Drbul : Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, the first question is on the eCommerce side, can you talk a little but about the success, the quarterly success and your confidence in the 35%? And how much of the toy category helped both in the fourth quarter when you think about the next year guidance on eCommerce? Doug McMillon : Bob, this is Doug. We're confident in that 35% number for eCommerce, and we'll drive that as I just mentioned earlier with the food and perishable business coming out of the supercenters, and we'll also drive it with the fulfillment center assortment that we're working on. Toys was a help in the fourth quarter. There was an opportunity there and the team did a good job of seizing it in total across stores and online. Bob Drbul : Okay. And then can you spend a little bit of time, you've given us a lot on the Flipkart performance. But I guess can you talk about the topline of the Flipkart since the regulatory changes and sort of how you're thinking about the business in terms of the trends? You said you're in line with the plan in the fourth quarter, but when you think about where we are today heading into 2019? Doug McMillon : I can't comment on the future the guidance for Flipkart in the first quarter. I'll just say that the things that have happened have been disappointed in some way, but they haven't shaken our confidence and excitement about what this is going to mean to the company long-term. And this isn't a story about one quarter or even one year. We hope to have an effective productive dialogue as it relates to future changes that happen. But in terms of how the business has behaved, it's in line with what we thought it would be. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Hey guys, good morning. First, Doug at that tail end of your comments on your prepared remarks, you mentioned new revenue streams as part of the longer term opportunity for Walmart. So, can you expand on that thought a little bit and perhaps speak to how you envision these potentially playing in the longer term ROI equation for the company. That's my first question. Doug McMillon : Sure. In fact, I will take you back to the October Analyst Meeting, Peter, we put up a chart that we referred to as an ecosystem chart. And our thought process is that we've got this core merchandising capability that we can continue to strengthen and we can transform in some ways in terms of how we work differently, how we use technology. And build on that with data and other components of our business to grow health and wellness where we've got an opportunity to be more important in that space. And financial service is another area where we've historically done some things, but there appeared to be more opportunities there for us. And there are some others that were represented on that chart that we're currently working on in a global fashion to create a business model by market that not only resonates with customers, but also delivers return for shareholders. Peter Benedict : Okay, thanks for that. And then Brett I just -- the U.S. average ticket up 3.3%, another great number there. Can you maybe unpack that a little bit inflation mix? And is there any tariff pass-through that we've seen or that we're going to see as we look out to 2019? Thank you. Brett Biggs : Hey you bet. Thanks Peter. Yes, in traffic and ticket, you probably heard me say this every quarter, traffic and ticket quarter-to-quarter can go back and forth and certainly we're focused on both and we're focused on the total. Happy with both. If you look at traffic, it's a two and a half year stack, so we're continuing to see good traffic coming at our stores. This is going to be influenced some by the continuing shift of our business with online grocery. With e-commerce you get a little different mix of basket in there. And category-by-category, Peter, you're seeing some categories that are deflating. We always have some of that; electronics will be one of those. And we've had some tariffs and there are places in which that does gets passed along and that does impact ticket. We're not seeing a great deal of inflation. I would call it fairly modest at this point. When you look at what we're doing from a price perspective, I think our customers really aren't seeing much inflation because of what we're doing. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to the operating expense leverage, you talked about some of the training and technology impact on that, but can you give us more color in terms of the rollout and some of the technologies that you highlighted at the Analyst Day what we should expect this year and over the next couple of years? Doug McMillon : This is Doug, Kelly. I think it's going to take us some time to sort that out and communicate specifically with some of the pieces of equipment that you saw, but it will happen. And we're just going to take our time, roll it from store group to store group. I'm really pleased and excited with how our managers are responding to all these new tools. They're now out in the stores. There is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for it. So that is a key part of our plan and we'll update you as things go on. But it will take us some time to put all of the pieces together that we shared with you and some others that we've got coming. Brett Biggs : And Kelly, this is Brett. We do -- as we said in October, we do feel like that as we see technologies developed and the processes we're coming up with. We do see opportunities to leverage over the next period of time as well. Kelly Bania : Great. And just a follow-up on the last comment about your customers not maybe seeing that much inflation, just curious if that's really specific to grocery and what you're seeing from your vendors there in terms of price increases, it sounds like your customers are not really seeing that. But maybe can you just elaborate on what you're seeing and what categories you are seeing inflation or deflation? Doug McMillon : I don't think we should get too specific by category. I think I would just say that the combination of cost pressures that we're feeling with the price reductions that we're making has worked out in a way that the customers are not feeling very much impacted. Brett Biggs : And our merchants -- it changes every year, but our merchants are always working through something that's inflating, something that's deflating. They're really good at managing mix in various different situations. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Karen Short : Hi, thanks. Just looking at U.S. in the fourth quarter, obviously I mean it was a very impressive leverage number. And I guess what I'm asking is, when I look through 2020, I guess, I don't really see anything that changes the cadence on the gross margin decline, if anything, maybe it gets a little bit easier because you lap transport? And then it seems like you kind of hit your stride on the expense leverage. So is 4Q kind of something we should expect in terms of the composition going forward because of those numbers are finally getting you to that tipping point where you can see past the Flipkart dilution, I guess? Brett Biggs : I'll speak first specifically to the U.S. because I think that was the main question. We're really seeing the productivity loop back in action in Walmart U.S. where you get the sales and it allows you to do what we want to do in prices, allows you to lower expenses. The productivity loop is alive and well in the U.S. The mix of our business continues to change as you look at eCommerce growing in the U.S., the acquisition of Flipkart and so that does change when you look at the total company. But as for leverage, I mentioned from a total company perspective, we expect to slightly lever-in Q1 and that just to get progressively better as we get through -- those through the year and we certainly couldn't do that or couldn't make that statement if we didn't feel pretty comfortable with what we're seeing in the U.S.. Again we've assumed this kind of sales growth to get that leverage. Sales growth has helped a lot in getting that leverage. But that's how we see the year playing out. Karen Short : Okay, that's helpful. And my second question is just on eCommerce. I guess, I was wondering if there was anything about the fourth quarter, I guess that surprised you on eCommerce in terms of either losses, well specifically losses. But I also was just wondering if you could give us an update on a number of SKUs -- total number of SKUs both 1P and then 3P. And then maybe just little a update on the mirroring of SKUs that your -- FCs because it seems to me that that's also one of the things that will help from the losses that is going a little slower than expected? Doug McMillon : Karen, this is Doug, I think that's right. We're making good progress on mirroring. And our total count is in the 75 million range now. There wasn't anything that I can think of that really surprised us in the fourth quarter as it relates to e-commerce. I would mention that you may remember a year ago we had some fulfillment center challenges and the team did a great job of preparing for peak and executing it this year and the customer experience was a lot better. So I was really pleased to see that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Robbie Ohmes : Thanks. Just another follow-up on e-commerce. So you guys called out doubling delivery again this year. Can you, maybe Doug, remind us how you guys are executing that? Who the key partners are? And maybe how the math is working on that? How do you make that leverageable, is there any scale opportunity there? Doug McMillon : Sure. Hi Robbie. We're using a combination of last mile solutions. We're using cloud source companies and we have our own platform that's called Spark that we're experimenting with and we're still playing around with some associate deliveries in a small way trying to figure that out. But it's the crowd source delivery platforms they're really helping us achieve scale. Generally speaking, the delivery cost cover the cost and we right now are operating with something like breakeven mentalities it relates to delivery cost, so customers are bearing that. But they really do like the convenience and I'm excited about figuring all this out. And the combination of great stores that can increasingly function as productive fulfillment centers, which by the way is helping keep pressure on in stocks which is what we saw from the UK years ago, really like that healthy pressure together with pickup, which continues to have a high NPS score and people love it. Now, with delivery and future enhancements in the future as it relates to the service end of that caused me to be really excited. It looks to me like there's a long runway here where our supercenters can double as fulfillment centers and stores and also generate a great store experience, so it looks promising. Robbie Ohmes : That sounds great. And just a follow-up question for you. I think in the presentation on China, you called that intensifying competition and I think also just mentioned slower growth overall in China. Can you just maybe fill us in on what you guys are seeing in China with the consumer overall over there? Doug McMillon : If you just read the headlines, you might imagine things are pretty tough, but that's not really what we're seeing. And if you look at our comp performance, Brett talked about a calendar change, but that aside, things have held up pretty well and the Sam's Clubs continue to be a really strong. I'm excited about the fact we've got more of those in the pipeline and the comp performance in Sam's is great. The supercenters have been performing better and they look better. I think operationally we've improved.  And then we've been playing around with some supermarkets and may find an opportunity there which can play a key role in last mile delivery. This relationship that we mentioned on last mile, they are resulting in incredible customer experiences in terms of both the value for delivery which is still think around of $1 and the speed with which it can get delivered given the density of the market is incredible. So that feels, okay. And I think if you look at the overall relationship considering all the things are happening in China, we're in pretty good shape. So, I'm still, I'm optimistic and recognize the tremendous opportunity that market has and we're constantly trying to think through our position in that market and how we might improve it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Seth Sigman : Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. I want to follow-up on the online grocery conversation. So I think you said that you're going to add another 1,000 stores this year. I'm curious more about how the ramp curve in the new stores maybe changing, as you see growth in consumer interest and awareness of the offering. And then, the second piece of the question on the topic of mix. I think when you purchase something through the Online Grocery app, you can actually add things outside of just grocery. I'm just curious, are you seeing any major change in mix there in the context of maybe improving profitability over time? Thanks. Doug McMillon : I think, two dimensions there. One is the customer enthusiasm for those kinds of offers. And it's a loud and clear to us that customers, no surprise, are really busy. And that, if we can find a way to make things more convenient for them with pick up and delivery, they're all over it. So, I think, the ramp there in terms of how our comp stores will behave in addition to the roll out that we're doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong. We have been adding assortment over time. Some of the happiest customers that I have come across are customers that can place their back-to-school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back-to-school. So that includes a lot of items that are not food items. And then, over time, we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food. It's a different situation to go and pick light bulbs our go to pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food. So we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items. And I do think that will help mix over time. And we may have seen that already, I haven't been tracking that part of it that closely, but it makes sense that that basket would change shape and the profitability would look better. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one follow-up question on the inventory growth, up 0.8% on a comp basis in the U.S., I think the first time in the recent memory. Strength of sales, obviously, very clear, but anything else to highlight there that maybe driving that? Doug McMillon : At first, I would say, the job that Greg and the team have done on the inventory over last few years has been phenomenal. I mean, being a merchant for so much of my career, I have so much respect for the way that they have driven in-stock levels, reduced inventory, reduce deletive inventory for quarter-after-quarter now. What happened in this case is that we saw the SNAP shift into the end of January. We build food inventories at the end of the quarter to make sure that we were maximizing that opportunity. And there's a little bit of pull forward of inventory in anticipation of what tariffs could mean in a worse case scenario, but we certainly hope and expect that that won't happen. So I'm not worried about inventory level. It's high quality and there's a bit of timing difference there and overall that picture still looks really good. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So if we look at the midpoint of your U.S. comp guidance, it's 2.5% to 3% for 2020. It's about 100 basis points below what you achieved in 2019. Should we take that to mean that's what you think the healthy spending environment driven in part by all the tax reform, contributed to your sales in the year-ago period, at about 100 basis points? Doug McMillon : I think that's exactly right. I think we're just recognizing that this last year had some tailwinds and that this year we won't have. Brett Biggs : Yeah. Obviously, there is some more challenging comparisons because of what we did this year, but I think what Doug's saying on healthy economic environment, you put a number of things together. I think this is the range that we feel good about going into the year. But still obviously a very, very healthy growth. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on Flipkart. How much is the regulatory environment going to influence your investment posture in that market? So if we see no change and the competition eases up. Are you going to look to maybe moderate your investments in the end market over time? Brett Biggs : So I think we'll see how the year goes and respond appropriately. But I would remind everybody that Flipkart is already an ecosystem. There's the PhonePe, a payment platform. There's a last mile delivery. There's a Myntra and Jabong businesses in apparel. So it's not just one thing. And it's just not an eCommerce business in the traditional sense, there's a lot of dimension to it. So there just like here we've got a lot of different variables we can play what demands the total. And I think we've forecasted it appropriately and we'll respond as the year goes on. Doug McMillon : Michael, when you look at, I mean, all the reasons we cited for going into India acquiring Flipkart when you look at the continued eCommerce growth in India, the size of the market, the growing middle class, all those things are still as true today as they were six months ago. So the reasons we're excited about the market are still there. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen : Hi, thank you. Good morning. A lot of our data is showing really great adoption of curbside grocery pickup as well as satisfaction here as well. What are your thoughts on how incrementality is unfolding? Also as this continues to be a very popular and widespread service, what's the future in terms of packing and taking in labor as you balance, just making sure your in-store experience is very good for those who aren't using curbside and also leveraging what you can with automation and robotics to optimize the total experience? Doug McMillon : Good questions, Oliver. I think the mix of new customers in online grocery is positive and encouraging to us. It's not just existing customer using the service. So that's an exciting development. And as it relates to productivity, we're continuing to learn how to pick more efficiently using the apps and the tools that you've seen in the stores plus we've got a few experiments going on with more automation to try and solve for future higher volumes. You can get to a point and we do cap in some store locations, a place where we have too many pickers in the store and it gets -- they get in the way of our customer shopping and site counter so we got to manage that effectively. And we had a Salem, a project alert. I forgot what we call it. AlphaBot maybe. The announcement that we made last year that's one to keep an eye on. But we're actively sorting out how to increase our in stocks, increase productivity and how the customer experience, continue to improve from an NPS point of view that will be an ongoing stream of work. Brett Biggs : And we're learning from the stores that were early in the process as they get larger and larger we're able to take those learnings from those stores that have been in the system a little longer to stores that are just coming online. Oliver Chen : Well, Brett on the topic of curbside, how are you thinking about ROIC and payback and as you make judgments you're rapidly rolling this out and people like it. But I'm curious about your thoughts on the multi-year and the investment versus the long-term share gains as well as customer reception? Brett Biggs : I do think about ROI a lot. You're correct. I -- when we're together as a team, I am talking about Doug's team, we spend as you can imagine most of our time thinking through the prioritization of the various things that are going on inside the company and as we go through those discussions, we always have the P&L and the balance sheet and ROI in front of us as part of those discussions. And it's our job as the management team to make these things work together over time. The customer acceptance, we're seeing with online grocery in particular is a one where you look at it and say we are going to lean into this. And there maybe things along the line and we delay this or can we stop something else, but we're going to lean into things like this and see when we see them working for the customer and as a team we will ensure that it works out for our shareholders over the mid to long term. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I have one kind of just shop keeping item with the discrete items in the fourth quarter. I'm trying to understand comparability, I think it's 47 point leverage we had in the U.S. business is that including or excluding the discrete items and if it's inclusive, how many basis points were the discrete items? Doug McMillon : Yeah. Scott, we had mentioned and that we've of course you've just heard it for the first time, we mentioned in the script that we -- that leverage is higher than it would normally be because of those discrete items. Last year, if you back those out, we still levered slightly in the quarter and for the year. But, clearly, fourth quarter was higher than you would normally expect because of those discrete items. Scott Mushkin : So there was just slight and would U.S. EBIT have grown without the discrete items? Brett Biggs : I am sorry, what did you say, Scott? I missed the question. Scott Mushkin : Would U.S. EBIT have grown without the discrete items? Brett Biggs : It would have been roughly flat. Scott Mushkin : Roughly flat. Okay. Great. Then my second question is regarding just kind of the strategy in the U.S. I mean, it seems like if I back away a little bit you guys talked about omni-channel pressuring probably little bit more seems like the international business is pressuring a little bit more. If I kind of add those things up, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of wiggle room to invest a lot in price in the U.S. Am I missing that? Or is that how you would frame it as well? Brett Biggs : Scott, I think we've got enough room. As you know, we've been on a multi-year plan to reduce pricing in the U.S. and we're just continuing that. There are some price investments in Sam's and in some international markets, but I'm comfortable. When you look at our forecast that we've got an appropriately aggressive price investment remaining as we finish-off what we started years ago. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Paul Trussell : Good morning and good quarter. Just wanted to maybe touch on guidance. Certainly, you are reiterating fiscal 2020 just given the moving parts in the business. But maybe just a little more detail around the cadence of the guide. Specifically, I think in 1Q, you mentioned, operating income to be down 10%. Just to what extent is that Flipkart versus currency? Or how should we think about the top line headwinds from SNAP or tax refunds? Just one going kind of cadence and improvement you expect to see over the balance of the year. What does that come from? Brett Biggs : Yes, Paul this is Brett. So, if you look at the cadence -- primarily what you are seeing in Q1 is going to be related to Flipkart. If you look at the guidance we've given last year and just look at how that would play out over the quarter, you can get pretty quickly to that number. There's always going to the timing of other parts of the business they go from one quarter to another based on how expenses are flowing, but that's the biggest part of Q1 and Q2 as well because it did not come in our results until partway through Q3. There's always -- we can have things move around between quarters $50 million here $60 million there and it can make a difference in how that number looks from a profitability standpoint, but Flipkart is the biggest part of that next year. Paul Trussell : Got it. And then as we look toward fiscal 2020, just your outlook on transportation expenses and the headwind there? And what you're seeing also on the wage front? Doug McMillon : On the wage side, Paul, we've just been moving up market-by-market. Our average now is about $17.50 for an hourly associate in the U.S. and I'm comfortable that we've got appropriate wage investments to get the talent we need baked into the plan. Transportation costs, I'm not really close to what's happening right now. I would expect based on what's happening with the drivers if we're going to be better shape from a transportation point of view as we go through the year. And it is helpful that gas prices are in the range that they are in and hope that continues to be the case. I think that's one of the things that benefited this last year. So, glad to see them where they are. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward Kelly : Yes, hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question actually on price investments. So, there has been some early signs I guess that food inflation beginning to couple a bit. And I'm just as curious as to what your thoughts are on allowing inflation to flow through, if they were to continue to strengthen? I guess as you think about that, right, holding the line would require a potential I guess incremental investment above what's planned. Is that something you'd be willing to do? Just help us understand how you think about the dynamic of food price inflation versus universe's price investment and what's budgeted for the year? Doug McMillon : Before I mention I just want to clarify what I mentioned earlier, $17.50 is actually $17.55 is the average hourly associate number with wages and benefits. As it relates to pricing, I think, as I mentioned earlier, we got an appropriately aggressive plan baked in. And it would depend on what happened with competition and the severity of the price increases. I think we would manage margins as we bring all these variables together. And don't anticipate having a lot more inflation on the food side and on the non-food side, we're continuing to experience deflation in that part of the basket, kind of works out. Edward Kelly : And then just one follow-up going on online grocery, pickup and delivery. How are you thinking about the end goal here? Is it one to two-hour delivery for our customers? How do you think about the cost to get where you want to go and how it impacts the timeframe around eventually improving e-commerce losses? Doug McMillon : I think we'll end up in a position where the customer can pick depending on the occasion, how they want to shop. There will be families that come into stores once-a-week or twice-a-month or whatever and they'll also use pickup, they'll also use delivery, and we'll have the ability to serve them in all those ways. There's an interesting opportunity if you could get to a point where customers pick their delivery window in the home or to the door unattended. You can decouple speed of delivery in a way that helps us manage costs, so as the volume goes up and density improves. We'll try to figure out how to drive a basket business it looks more like dense route than a one-hour or a 30-minute race to deliver to somebody's house. That maybe different for restaurant delivery than it is for grocery delivery. It seems like those use cases are different enough. So we've got some tests going on and real-time learning here to try and do it in a way that customers want it to be done and create that optionality for them. And it's kind of one more mix opportunity for us. We grew up managing merchandise mix and still do and now we're managing a service mix. And the good news is that once customers are in your ecosystem, they'll use you in some way as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, you get the opportunity to expand on that relationship and that's what we're trying to do. Brett Biggs : Scott, I want to, this is Brett. I want to come back and clear myself. I said that U.S. income, U.S. operating income ex one items was flat. I misspoken that it was up a little bit in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Edward Yruma : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess two quick ones. First on macro. Obviously less tailwinds this year, but are you starting to see any changes in consumer behavior that would indicate that we're starting to level off or seeing some deterioration. And I guess as a follow-up you're running a dual time strategy with the Jet, I guess how would you score your kind of Jet business and serving those urban millennials? Thank you. Brett Biggs : Edward, this is Brett, I'll start off. In the consumer, I think it feels pretty good to us. You see all the numbers that we see, wages are still pretty good, unemployment rate's low, gas prices are down year-on-year. So, there's a number of things I think are still working in favor of the consumer. Like you mentioned we're watching it as we always do. We're monitoring it, and making sure that we're in the right place with the customer. I think no matter of the environment, we tend to do pretty well and are able to react and be there for those customers, but we're monitoring it as we always do. Doug McMillon : The first quarter is always a challenge, because you got an Easter change, there's weather that's a little more impactful than it's volatility. We got the SNAP moving into the first quarter, the tax rebates, I mean different windows of times, sometimes, they are concentrated in a few days, sometimes they are spread out over a week. So it makes it exciting to manage Q1. But underneath all that, I'll agree with what Brett said they're in pretty good shape. On Jet I'm really pleased with the role that it's playing, attracting new brands. And our focus as we mentioned before is on urban markets. So it's an opportunity to learn and to try new items and different items in some cases that we have at wallmart.com so that's the role it's playing. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. Charles Grom : Hey thanks. Good morning and great quarter here. Just one near-term question, Brett. Do you guys expect that 40 basis points SNAP benefit to reverse in the first quarter? And then long-term question just with regard to digital, when you think about 2019 losses being greater than 2018. Would you expect the 2019 losses to be the peak based on what you know now? And then as a follow-up to that when you think about mix being issue, when you think about correcting that you guys were pretty active a couple of years ago acquiring more of the digitally native brands. Do you feel like you need to do more of that to sort of fix that issue? Brett Biggs : Chuck, there's a lot in that question. I'll take the first two and then I'll hand off to Doug. On the SNAP benefits, I mean we are clear you know that, we believe that it did pull forward some into the fourth quarter. Again with all the things that happened in the first quarter, I think we did pull that forward, but there's other things that can potentially make up for that, but that's why we've given the quarterly guidance any quarter it can be kind of 2.5% and 3%, 2.5%-3.5% for the year. On the eCommerce loss guidance where we've said that we expect losses to be a little more in this next year, we're not going to give guidance past that which I think probably won't surprise you. Doug you want to talk about the... Doug McMillon : Yes, preserving flexibility there, I think it's important, we have never let a digital transformation at this scale before. So we're figuring this out as we go. But if there's an opportunity to be more aggressive given the total balance of the business, I mean we would be thinking about that. Adding digital brands we're after assortment, we're after a repetitive customer relationship. And we're looking constantly at various acquisitions. And I think what you've seen from us in the past will continue to some extent. It's impossible to predict the pace of it or the number. So we'll just have to see at the end of the year how it will work out. Dan Binder : Okay. That will conclude our Q&A session and our call today. We thank you for your time and interest in Walmart.

    "content": "\ufeff Daniel Binder : Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's 2020 Investment Community Meeting. Thank you all for being here, and thanks to those joining us on the webcast. We appreciate your interest in Walmart. I know the executive team looks forward to sharing their strategies with you and answering your questions. Now let me get a few of our usual statements out of the way. The information presented at today's meeting should be viewed in conjunction with our press release and earnings materials that can be found on our website, stock.walmart.com. The presentations will also be posted on our website as they are completed. Today's presentations include forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. Please reference our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website, stock.walmart.com. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our earnings materials issued this morning, which we'll discuss in more detail during today's presentations. You can see today's agenda on the screens beside me. So we'll kick things off in a minute with Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO. Then you'll hear from our CFO, Brett Biggs. And at that point, we'll have a 30-minute Q&A session to discuss Q4 results and guidance. Following that, we will have a brief break and then continue with the rest of our program. After the segment presentations, we'll be doing something new this year. We will have an innovation panel discussion to highlight some of the many innovations across the business. We will then wrap up with an hour Q&A session. And at the end of that session, our formal meeting will conclude. We invite you to join us upstairs for lunch, where you'll have an opportunity to spend time with our executive team. With that, let's get things started. Doug McMillon : Good morning. Thanks for coming. You're going to hear about our future plans from several of our leaders today, let's begin by talking about Q4. I'll give you a summary and then Brett will come up and share more detail about the quarter, the year and our guidance going forward. We feel pretty good about the year, even though the fourth quarter was not our best. Our momentum in food and consumables within Walmart U.S. has continued. That's been our priority, and it's good to have that strength to build on. Our volume in stores as well as through pickup and delivery remains strong. And it was good to see our U.S. eCommerce growth of 35% for the quarter and 37% for the year. Our sales missed to plan in the U.S. within our stores and related to a few general merchandise categories. Sales in November and January were what we expected, but the weeks just before Christmas fell short. We performed well in electronics, Christmas seasonal, the home categories and health and wellness; but were short of plan in toys, media and gaming and apparel. The sales miss to plan and less favorable mix of sales impacted operating income and a change to our attendance policy contributed to wages being higher than they would have otherwise been. So a few things came together that affected our results. We know what happened, and we're already taking steps to address them. You'll hear more details from John and Marc in a bit, but those steps include adjusting our apparel assortment and presentation in stores. We were too opening-price-point dominant this year and we had too much of an investment in Christmas seasonal apparel. Also, we'll adjust some of the toy decisions we made, which John will say more about. And we'll change our approach to layaway, which missed sales plan by quite a bit this year. In addition to adjustments to our plan for stores, it's obviously important to accelerate progress in eCommerce, given the ongoing channel shift. We'll continue to build our eCommerce assortment by adding items and brands in key general merchandise categories. We'll improve our ability to ship e-commerce orders during peak and make sure that customers know we can do it. We exited the quarter in good shape in terms of the amount and content of our inventory. January sales are on plan and February sales have started off well, too. Sam's Club's fourth quarter sales were a little better than plan, with membership and eCommerce performing well. Walmex, India and China were highlights in Q4. Walmex is a real gem and we're really proud of that team. With respect to India, we remain excited about the opportunity we have there. The way Flipkart and PhonePe are scaling is impressive. In China, we drove improved momentum in the back half of the year as Sam's Club and eCommerce experienced strong results. We're managing the issues related to the coronavirus daily. Our primary focus is, of course, on our associates and our customers. Judith and Brett will share more about our thoughts and actions a little bit later. Now Brett will give you the detail on the quarter, the year and our guidance for this year, then I'll come back up and tell you more about our plan going forward. Brett? Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Great to be with you here in New York City, and thanks for everybody that's joining us on the webcast. So as always, there are a lot of exciting things going on at Walmart. This is my 20th year with the company, and I've seen it evolve, and I've seen it adapt, and I've seen it grow in remarkable ways. And even as I start my fifth year in this role, I'm still amazed at the number of things we've accomplished over the past few years. Walmart remains nimble. We're focused on building the world's greatest omnichannel platform. And we continue to position this business for long-term success. There are several things I hope you'll take away from this morning. We achieved most of our full year financial goals. And while we didn't hit on all cylinders for some of the fourth quarter, we had a good year. Our ability to operate with lower costs provides competitive advantages, ensures we continue to gain market share. We're leveraging expenses at levels not seen in a while and is sustainable. Our investments are paying off, and you can see this in reduced associate turnover, store innovation, high eCommerce growth rates, strong private brand growth and I could name many more. The productivity loop is alive and well. So in recent years, we've widened price gaps. We've increased sales. We've leveraged expenses. And we've grown operating profit in Walmart U.S., Sam's Club, Walmex and other markets. We're leveraging our scale, our unique assets and financial strength to ensure structural competitive advantages. Our company's foundation is extremely strong. So let's discuss the fourth quarter. As Doug mentioned, sales were good through Cyber Monday as well as in January and February has started off well. But the few weeks leading up to Christmas weren't as strong. Doug mentioned a few reasons, but we believe also the compressed holiday season impacted stores more than eCommerce. Adjusted EPS was within our guidance, but operating income was lower than plan due to sales misses in a few GM categories and soft sales in a couple of key international markets. We still leveraged expenses by 25 basis points, but we could have been sharper in some places. We also invested more heavily in technology during the quarter, which we expect to continue this year. The technologies we've talked about is a key part of our strategy, and we'll continue to accelerate progress on back-end activities on associate tools and key customer-facing initiatives. And I have great confidence in our technology team to invest aggressively but also intelligently. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.38. However, adjusted EPS would have been about $0.05 higher except for 2 items. First, as mentioned, when we gave guidance at the end of Q3, the unrest in Chile had an estimated negative impact on operating income of about $110 million. We weren't able to quantify this when we gave guidance at the end of Q3 so nothing was included. We experienced significant disruptions in nearly 3/4 of the stores at one point, with some of them completely destroyed. And now given the extent of the disruption, we don't expect the business to fully recover this year, which has been considered in our guidance today. In addition, we also recorded an unexpected legal accrual in the U.S. of approximately $75 million. As Doug mentioned earlier, we understand the factors that impacted results for a few weeks in the quarter, and we're addressing them. The core business remains very, very healthy. And in particular, the food and consumables business around the world is strong. And in fact, in Q4, Walmart U.S. grocery comps on a 2-year stack basis were among the best in the past 10 years. And we continue to take market share, according to Nielsen. So let's turn to sales for the quarter and the full year, and you'll be glad I'm not going to go through all of the various numbers live. So please reference the press release and the presentation this morning, and I'll give you some highlights here. Total net sales in constant currency increased to over $140 billion for the quarter and reached $524 billion for the year, which is growth of nearly $14 billion. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 1.9% in the quarter with roughly balanced contributions from comp transactions and ticket. And as a reminder, these results include a 50 basis point headwind from lapping last year's SNAP benefit, adjusted for the 53rd week this year. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales increased 6%, putting 2-year stacks at 6% or more for 6 of the last 7 quarters. For the year, Walmart U.S. achieved a 2.8% comp and a 6.4% comp on a 2-year stack basis. So Walmart U.S. sales grew by more than $9 billion in FY '20. eCommerce sales were also strong, up 35% for the quarter. Grocery remained strong, but we also had sales -- good sales in several online GM categories. For the year, growth was 37%, which is slightly higher than we had guided. International sales increased 2.2% for the quarter, with strength in Mexico, in China and India, and it was offset by the unrest in Chile and some continuing challenges in the U.K. and Canada. For the year, international sales increased a solid 2.8% in constant currency. At Sam's Club, solid comp sales continued this quarter, increasing 3.8%, excluding fuel and tobacco. eCommerce sales grew 33% on top of 24% last year -- in Q4 last year. So let's turn now to operating income and EPS. Over the quarter, adjusted operating income declined by 3.7% on a constant currency basis. For the year, adjusted operating income decreased by 1.9%. But excluding Flipkart, adjusted operating income would have increased for the year. Consolidated gross profit margin declined 40 basis points for the year, and that primarily reflects a merchandise, channel mix shifts; price investments in various markets, including the U.S., so things we've been talking about this year; and also the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart versus a partial year the previous year. The Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was only down 14 points for the year. And even with lower-than-anticipated sales, we leveraged expenses of the company by 25 basis points, excluding adjusted items in the quarter, and 24 basis points for the year. Walmart U.S. operating income declined 3.8% in the quarter, but stores, U.S. stores operating income, growth would have been slightly positive if not for the legal expense I mentioned earlier. Now the eCommerce gross margin rate increased and they leveraged expenses. However, as eCommerce grows, it changes the mix of expense and margin rates for the segment. For the year, Walmart U.S. increased operating income by 2.6%. International adjusted operating income increased slightly for the quarter in constant currency. But excluding the unrest in Chile, adjusted operating income would have grown by nearly 10%. The International team delivered really solid expense leverage on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter. The dilution from Flipkart was as expected. In fact, I had a great visit to Flipkart and to PhonePe a few weeks ago. And I always come back impressed with the energy, the management depth, the financial discipline and the entrepreneurial spirit that I see here, and Judith -- see there. And Judith will talk more about that later on. In Sam's Club, solid membership trends contributed to an operating income growth of 8% for the year, so solid performance there. Now FY '20 adjusted EPS excludes a few larger items that are noted on our release this morning. Adjusted EPS was up slightly versus last year, which is within our guidance. We finished the year in good inventory position with Walmart U.S. and total company roughly flat year-on-year. Operating cash flow for the year continued to be strong, over $25 billion, and the company returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Now operating cash flow was down about $2 billion year-on-year. About half of that difference is due to the Asda pension contribution that we made during the year. So here's the scorecard for the year compared to our guidance at the start of the year. Now despite not finishing as strongly as we would have liked from a sales standpoint at the end of the year, I'm really pleased with what we accomplished for the full year. Now over the past several years, we've made great progress in transforming to win with customers and with shareholders and we've made strategic choices. And the payback on those decisions is becoming more evident. And we're glad that investors have been rewarded over the past several years. You can see how the company has evolved by looking at the composition of sales and CapEx versus just a few years ago. We used to open hundreds of stores each year in the U.S., but we struggled to gain traction on comp sales. Today, we're opening very few new stores in the U.S., and we're driving more efficient growth with solid Walmart U.S. and Sam's comps. We used to have a global eCommerce business with just over $8 billion in sales. This year, we estimate global eCommerce sales will approach $50 billion, and that's doubling just over 2 years. Now while some of that's come from acquisitions, we're changing the nature of how we interact with customers. $50 billion in revenue would put us well within the Fortune 100, even just on its own. Just a few years ago, we had no stores, no U.S. stores with online grocery pickup, and we didn't deliver groceries. Now we have about 3,200 stores with pickup and 1,600 stores with delivery. We've added a great deal of new technology, such as Ask Sam, Scan & Go, automated self-check -- shelf-scanning robots and a whole host of tools that help customers and associates. So a lot has changed in a short period of time while we've been delivering solid financial results. This is such an exceptionally strong company, and I don't want that to get lost. There just aren't many companies in the world like Walmart : Total revenue approaching $525 billion; an incredibly strong balance sheet with a AA credit rating; a diversified asset base, physical, digital assets in the most important markets around the world; more than 265 million customer transactions a week; a 2.2 million-strong associate base; and a strong stable cash flow. And this financial strength gives us the ability to win now and in the future. Most companies have to decide between protecting its core business or growing new businesses, but we can do both. We continue to be guided by a consistent financial framework, which you've seen. And if we execute in these areas, we're going to win with customers and with investors. In the year ahead, we'll continue to focus on the most productive growth opportunities. We'll prioritize comp sales and eCommerce growth. Walmart U.S. has had more than 5 consecutive years of positive comp sales and transactions. In addition, eCommerce growth continues to be strong, and we expect that to continue. We expect total sales growth on a constant currency basis to be around 3%. That represents over $16 billion in growth. We expect the momentum to continue this year with Walmart U.S. segment comps of at least 2.5%, and that growth fairly consistent across quarters with each quarter expected to be at least 2%. Now this growth would imply 2-year stacks of well over 5%. We expect U.S. eCommerce sales to be -- growth to be around 30% and with quarterly growth ranging from the mid-20s to the mid-30s. And as you can see here, we expect eCommerce sales to represent more than half of our total global sales growth. In international, we expect to see solid sales growth around 4% with strength in Mexico and India. And we'll have some continued softness, we believe, in the U.K. and Canada. Our China business also continues to operate well, and in particular, Sam's Club. Now certainly, the coronavirus tempers our expectations some, and I'll discuss that more shortly. We expect Sam's Club to continue to have good sales momentum with comp sales, excluding fuel and tobacco, of at least 3%. One of the areas I'm most proud of is the team's work around operating discipline and expense leverage. And last year, we challenged the team with an enterprise-level goal of 20 basis points of leverage, and we exceeded that, excluding adjusted items. The Walmart U.S. stores team has leveraged expenses for 12 consecutive quarters. The investments in training and technology are helping sales and they're helping efficiency. And I'm very passionate about getting our expense rate down even further in a smart and sustainable way. If this business achieves SG&A levels of 20%, or hopefully even lower, we will continue to have options other competitors don't. And as you can see, we are bending the curve on expenses. Over the past couple of years, we've implemented smart spend initiatives across most of the organization. And you can take a lot of small projects, you can scale them across the business and they can lead to impressive savings. We have hundreds of opportunities underway and in the pipeline, but let me give you a few examples. One example of combining a new technology with a new process is a type of store automation called the FAST unloader. Some of you have seen it. 2 years ago, we didn't have any of these. Today, we have them in more than 1,700 stores. If you haven't seen it before, the FAST unloader automatically scans and sorts items coming off a truck and it takes about 1/3 of the time out of the truck unload. It makes the job easier. It requires less time. It automatically prioritizes product to fill gaps in the floor. Now since inception, these FAST unloaders have prioritized more than 25 million cases of merchandise that would have otherwise resulted in out of stocks. So you can tell, when we find technology and process that makes us better, we are moving quickly to scale it. We can also improve the business and the environment at the same time. We're investing in new technology that gives us enhanced visibility to the energy usage of store equipment. So think Internet of Things. By centralizing the monitoring and the maintenance of equipment, we expect to save around $100 million annually over time, improve the customer experience and help the environment. So this kind of initiative really demonstrates our Save Money Live Better purpose. We're also seeing cost savings in goods not for resale, or GNFR. We were doing okay in this area before, but we weren't leveraging our scale as much as we should have. For instance, just by changing our buying process and better utilizing our scale for shopping bags, we anticipate saving more than $60 million annually. Another example is we're going to save 15% on the cost of associate vests. They're made with recyclable material, which is more comfortable and is more sustainable. In Mexico, we're increasing the use of eOptions in areas like transportation and supplies. And last year, we saved about 15% on a spend of nearly $300 million. So these are just a few of many examples of how we're doing business differently than we've done in the past, and small changes can have a really big impact in this company. We've made good progress on expenses, and we expect to achieve around 20 basis points of SG&A leverage again this year and over the next few years, assuming consistent levels of comp sales. As I mentioned earlier, the nature of our CapEx spend has changed dramatically over the past several years. This year, we'll continue to invest the vast majority of capital in store remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain to ensure we give customers the convenient shopping experience that they expect. We'll also invest more this year in technology to upgrade legacy systems and lean into customer-facing technology and technology of the future. However, quite a bit of this spend will hit OpEx versus Capex. For the year, we expect CapEx to be similar to last year at around $11 billion, with slightly more going toward the U.S. versus last year. I'm really proud that over the past 10 years, we've returned close to $130 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, over the past 10 years, we bought back roughly 30% of the outstanding shares at average prices well below the current stock price. This has been a good investment. That's in addition to investing nearly $120 billion in CapEx over the past decade to grow the business. And the ability to do all of this makes Walmart a truly unique story. With our announcement this morning, we've increased our dividend for 47 consecutive years. And we also remain committed to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $5.7 billion remaining on our buyback program, and we intend to complete that this year. So here's how all this comes together, and you can find a complete listing of guidance metrics in this morning's press release, you've probably already seen it. I've mentioned our sales and capital guidance, I'll focus a little more on profit guidance. Now as always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including general consistency in economic conditions, currency rates and tax and the regulatory landscape. The consumer environment is pretty healthy in the U.S. and our competitive position is strong. We're also performing well in a number of key international markets like Mexico, China and India, while the U.K. and Canada remain challenging in some respects. Based on currency rates today, FX would have limited impacts on sales and operating income for the full year, but some slight negative impacts earlier in the year. Of course, rates can change, so I encourage you to update your models as we go through the year. Also, we have not included any potential future change in the value of our investment in JD.com. We're going -- we're continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions, and we'll continue to actively manage pricing and margins with customers and shareholders in mind. We're also monitoring conditions in Chile, and our guidance assumes a relatively stable environment there. We're also continuing to monitor the coronavirus situation. Our first priority, as you heard Doug say, is ensuring the safety and well-being of our associates and our customers, and we're taking actions in that regard. Currently, we do anticipate some financial impact to the China business in Q1 and potentially into Q2. Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1. We also continue to monitor how this might impact our sourcing operations. As of now, we aren't seeing major impacts, but if there are any longer-term shipping issues, it would likely impact our business. Because the situation is still so fluid, we haven't included any specific impacts related to the coronavirus in our guidance, which I'm going to discuss next. We expect FY '21 EPS to be in a range of $5 to $5.15, which implies a growth rate of about 1.5% to 4.5% versus this past year's adjusted EPS. And this growth is expected despite the increased tech spend, which I mentioned previously. We expect operating income dollars to increase by a similar growth rate as EPS. And we expect Walmart U.S. operating income to increase by an amount of the upper end of that range. We also anticipate Flipkart's dilution to be relatively consistent with FY '20's adjusted results. Now with regards to Walmart U.S. eCommerce profitability, we expect losses this year to be flat to slightly lower versus last year. We've seen improvement in contribution margins as well as variable fulfillment costs, and we expect that to continue this year. We'll also benefit some from the recent reorganization and consolidation activities. Now on a con-solid basis -- consolidated basis, we expect the quarterly cadence of EPS growth to be in the low single digits in Q1 and Q3 and in or near mid-single digits in Q2 and Q4. Now this cadence is primarily due to the impacts of the Chile unrest, comping some expense timing in the U.S. segment last year and the timing of increased tech spending which actually accelerated in this past quarter. As a reminder, fairly small shifts in the timing of expenses and other factors can change this quarterly guide -- this quarterly cadence. And again, to be clear, none of the guidance I just mentioned includes any potential coronavirus impacts, including the couple of cents potential impact from the China business that I mentioned earlier. Now typically, EPS growth is higher than operating income growth due to share repurchase. In FY '21, we expect the growth rates to be similar to what you've seen due to lapping some tax rate benefits from last year, leading to a slightly higher effective tax rate this year; as well as increased costs related to the Asda pension plan, which hits below operating income. We don't currently expect these headwinds to continue past this year. So as I close, I hope you have a sense of why we're so excited about the future. Our core business is really strong and we're performing well. We are rock-solid financially. We're leveraging our scale. We're leveraging our unique assets. And paybacks from recent investments are helping fund future innovations. Expense leverage is sustainable and the cost culture is strong again. And our guidance reflects continued progress and solid performance. This is a really special company. 20 years here. And I'm so proud to be a part of this team and this company's transformation. I'm confident our strategy and our financial strength are going to make us a winner in retail for many years to come. And with that, I'm going to ask Doug to come back up. And we thought we would go ahead and just take some questions on guidance and year. And Dan, you want to start us out? Daniel Binder : Yes. So we are going to have, as I mentioned earlier, a separate Q&A session at the end of today's program. So this Q&A session is really designed for Q4 and guidance. We'll stick, hopefully, to that and get through the next 30 minutes if we have that many questions. If not, we'll continue the program sooner. Daniel Binder : We have our mics. Karen, right up here? Brett Biggs : Oh, there's Karen. I was looking for her. Right there in the front row. Karen Short : Karen Short, Barclays. So just want to talk a little bit about eCommerce growth. I think there's a view that -- or there has been a view that the growth rate needs to slow much more meaningfully because you've been much more reliant on the grocery aspect, and that you're lapping the growth in terms of units and also the overall growth rate for click-and-collect. So can you talk a little bit about the growth rate, and if you could parse out a little bit the grocery component and the discretionary component of the eCom growth? Doug McMillon : Yes, sure. I'll start, and Brett, you can add in if you want to. I think we've got room to run on both. If you look at the grocery side of things, the first thing that goes through my mind is product quality and what we're doing in the supply chain to make sure the stores look great. Not only is that product what we put in front of customers every day in stores, but it's what we pick and it's what we deliver. And our pickup business, as we've lapped, anniversaried stores that we've rolled out, has continued to show strong comps, and we have the opportunity to add more stores, and then we're layering delivery on top of that. And while we're up to 1,600 stores with delivery, we've still got a runway to go there to add stores and we've got comp numbers that we can drive just on delivery from store to store. So there are so many dimensions that we can build on to grow there, and the stores increasingly can start to pick general merchandise. So you'll start to see a basket that looks like it's broader than just food and consumables. Big GM assortment in stores, a lot of items that are of tremendous values to customers, and we'll layer that on. At the same time, we've got the walmart.com opportunity. And with the action that Marc and the team took earlier this year to expand the number of next-day items that we have, we've got that growth opportunity. That number, SKU count-wise, will continue to go up. And you'll hear more in a little bit about what we're doing with marketplace and fulfilled-by as a service. So there's a breadth of opportunities to drive growth there. And we think the number that we've guided towards today is a number that we can deliver, and it will be a combination of both. Simeon Gutman : Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. In fiscal '20, you returned to profitable growth. The beginning of the year, you did it with a little better sales and margin, and then we ended a little soft. Going forward, we have next-day. Food seems to be outpacing the mix of other categories. How do you maintain this balance going forward? And given that the stakes seem to be rising, was there any debate whether to lean back into investments? Doug McMillon : Well, we'll continue -- and we'll talk about this in a little bit as well, we'll continue some level of price investments. Staying on the offense and driving the productivity loop is our mindset around those things. I'm not forgetting the fact that we make money in food and consumables. And you know that with the mix of fresh, there's profitability there, and we're starting to do some membership sales which are interesting. But there is a particular focus in the company, especially after the fourth quarter, on general merchandise. As we walk our stores, we think we've got room to improve in several different general merchandise departments as well as just adding brands and SKUs like we've been doing so feverishly on Walmart.com. So we've got to execute the GM side of the box in addition to the food side, but we're very focused on it. Brett Biggs : And Simeon, as I went through the presentation this morning, the thing that's so great about this business, we have so many different pieces of the business and so many different levers to pull. And as we make these decisions, it just gives us a chance to prioritize in a way that's just always in line with the customer and still get profitability where we need it to be over a longer period of time. Daniel Binder : Bob, next. Robert Drbul : Bob Drbul, Guggenheim Securities. Brett, you talked about, just in the overall guide, increased tech spending. I was wondering if you could just give us a couple, the projects or the focus areas, exactly where that money is going. And your... Brett Biggs : Yes, if you'll wait just a little bit longer, Suresh is going to come up later and talk a little bit about it. But there's a number of things, Bob, in that some of it's back end. Those would be things that you would have never seen. We've talked about before, as a company, you're always going to have some tech debt, and we want to accelerate some progress around that. Several initiatives underway in -- with things that help our associates be more efficient. John will talk a little bit about that later on. And then what's the customer going to look like in the future? How do they want to shop in the future? And Suresh and his team, along with Marc and others, are really focused on that. And again, we will talk about that a little bit more later. I don't what to steal their thunder. Daniel Binder : We'll just stick with Peter right here. Peter Benedict : Peter Benedict at Baird. Just back to the online grocery discussion. Can you give us a little more detail on maybe how many more stores you think you'll be able to add this year? And is this the last year of rollout from that initiative? And then Doug, you mentioned that you're seeing strong growth. I mean, the comps in this business as you get in years 2 and 3, can you maybe frame it? Is it -- how strong is strong? Is it double digits? Just how it seems to be scaling at this point. Doug McMillon : Yes, I don't think we've quantified the number on comps for grocery pickup and delivery, but they are really strong. And now we're to the point, Peter, where we can see some stores that are in their second and third years. So that's also really encouraging to see. In a little bit, we'll talk about the expansion of store numbers with the specific numbers for pickup and delivery. But it's a combination of adding some stores and driving that comp growth and then putting everything together with the membership fee that's on our mind. Daniel Binder : [indiscernible] Kate. Brett Biggs : Oh, it's Kate. Katharine McShane : Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about apparel, how much of the gross margin pressure during the quarter was due to some of the weakness in that category and how we should think about apparel's contribution to both comp and gross margin in 2021? Doug McMillon : Yes. It was, as we mentioned earlier, one of the areas where we fell short. And what we think happened is we got really focused, maybe even more so, on opening price points inside the stores and also very focused on Christmas seasonal apparel. We looked like red and green and could have been more basic and could have had some kind of middle price points as opposed to opening price points. And so we're focused on that. There's a ton of work on SKU count, presentation that's been underway for a while now, and we're optimistic that we'll be able to improve the in-store assortment of apparel and in parallel grow our apparel business online. We have a really big opportunity to sell a lot more apparel online. And we're adding brands. We've had some success this last year with some of the brands that we've launched, including Scoop. But there's a lot of upside for apparel online as well. We need them both. It's really an important category, not only from the customer experience, but from a margin mix point of view. Brett Biggs : And Kate, I mentioned about contribution margin increasing in eCommerce. Some of that is because of increased apparel sales, and we're doing better at apparel online. Doug McMillon : Yes. We should say, for just walmart.com, apparel is growing faster than the total. Apparel and home are both performing well, we just need even more from them. Daniel Binder : Next up is Robbie, then we'll come to Greg up front. Robert Ohmes : You guys mentioned a $50 billion eCommerce number, that's for -- that's what you think for fiscal '21. Brett Biggs : Global. Robert Ohmes : Global eCommerce. Is that a GMV number? Or does that include... Brett Biggs : That's sales. Net sales. Robert Ohmes : That's just owned sales. So Doug, I think in your comments in the third quarter, you mentioned doing more with the marketplace or 3P business. Can you -- how is that in the fourth quarter? And what are you guys seeing in 3P? Doug McMillon : Yes, it was good. But we don't think that we've done everything we must do and should do to support marketplace sellers in terms of the tools and services that we have available. And we've grown a marketplace business over the last few years to a pretty good size, and it's helped us a lot with the assortment and being top of mind for customers as they're looking for items. There's a lot of upside for us and Marc's going to talk a little bit more about that later. So let me let him elaborate on it. Robert Ohmes : Can you tell us how big the U.S. 3P basis is? Doug McMillon : Not big enough. Daniel Binder : Go to Greg Melich. Go to Greg Melich up front, Kary. Brett Biggs : He's right here, Kary. Daniel Binder : And then we'll go to the side of the room next. Gregory Melich : Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Brett, just to make sure I got the numbers right. Given the EBIT dollar growth in the U.S., should we assume that gross margin rate is down 15, 25 bps, that would be the corollary? Brett Biggs : Yes, I think the way we've guided, you can see that we expect operating margins to be fairly flat with what we've had here. And so when you look at the expense leverage of around 20, that's a pretty good algorithm. Gregory Melich : And where is that gross margin pressure? If you were to put it, it's either price investment or eCommerce investment or mix? Like, what's your strength? Where is that coming from? And then, Doug, I had a follow-up. Brett Biggs : Yes, it's a little bit of both. So we'll continue to invest in price globally. We've made -- and John, again, will talk about this a little more in the U.S. We've invested quite a bit in food and consumables. You'll see a little more price investment coming in general merchandise over time. And then globally, we're making price investments as well. I think I like how we're doing. I think we're smart about, we're strategic about it. So I feel good about the pace of price investments. But there is a mix shift. As eCommerce becomes bigger, you do see some mix shift, and you saw it some in the fourth quarter. Gregory Melich : Got it. And then, Doug, I think it was 5 years ago, we had an Analyst Day here where you talked about the imperative of investing in margin to get traffic growing again. And clearly, that's worked, right? So traffic is consistently positive, et cetera. As we take away from today, where do you think we'll be 3, 4, 5 years from now? Is this the trend we should learn to expect, that hopefully, EBIT margins stay flattish and the goal is to keep driving traffic up 1 or 2? How do you think about that balance as you think about the business out a few years? Doug McMillon : Yes. I think growing traffic in that range would be a good accomplishment, but I'd like to see more than that, especially when you think about it in an omnichannel fashion. And the combination of choices that we make, we'll manage from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, we can make investments at store level in price to help drive the productivity loop. We can make investments in eCommerce to help drive eCommerce. And as we see eCommerce losses improve, it gives us some room to make choices to do things like this year, the choice that we're making to accelerate our modernization of technology, which we'll talk more about in a moment. So the team works together in a really fluid way to set these priorities to make sure we're balancing all these things, including driving traffic growth. But overall, I would expect that we can transform the company while maintaining a level of profitability that is in the range of what we're talking about for this year. But we only set guidance 1 year at a time. Daniel Binder : So we're going to go to Michael... Brett Biggs : Okay. I was going to do -- I was going to end with that. Yes. I've been well coached. Daniel Binder : If you could just -- if you could state your name and firm... Michael Baker : Sure. It's Mike Baker from Nomura. One bigger-picture question then a couple of quick-hit ones, if I could. But so it seems like eCommerce was a little bit better in the fourth quarter, store is not quite as good. Is that a function of the shorter selling period, do you think? Or is there something bigger going on to think about into next year? And then I'll just trot off the quick ones, if I could, real quick. How much is Chile going to cost you next year in the guidance? Layaway, what happened there? And then finally, I'll give this excuse to you, even though you didn't use it. Did the weather hurt your apparel at all in the fourth quarter? Brett Biggs : This reminds me of Dan Binders' old questions that were 4-parters. Doug McMillon : You may go first. Brett Biggs : Let me start with Chile. So what we've assumed for Chile has clearly had a big impact to the business last year. And certainly, our associates and our customers have gone through a lot in that market. We're assuming in our guidance that the market remains relatively stable. We don't expect the business to come back in full because of the unrest and the damage that we had. But we assume basically how we came out of the year is how we're going to go into next year. Doug McMillon : So yes, eCommerce was ahead of plan and stores were behind plan; and some combination of 6 fewer days, channel shift to eCommerce, maybe even that weather word you mentioned, all those things factored into what happened. And we wish we could tell you precisely how it weighted out. I don't think we're going to be able to tell you exactly what happened. But we do know that we've got room to improve in terms of store merchandising and assortment, not to say that there aren't a lot of strengths there. I mean, we've called out the specific categories. I can't remember a year where there wasn't a hot toy. The hottest toy this year was under $5. Many brands, these miniature mayonnaise jars and ketchup bottles, which I still don't completely understand. But it didn't really drive a lot of volume. There's not really another hot item. That's unusual. The calendars, every few years, this happens. And I didn't feel very good the last time this happened. And I'm getting old enough to remember several cycles now. So I'm not sure how to weight all that out for you. But we do know we've got to keep getting better at eCommerce and we got to run great stores, and that's where our focus is on tactically. Daniel Binder : I'll go to Michael Lasser and then Oliver after that. Michael Lasser : Mike Lasser from UBS. Thank you for having this day. I mean, we should get together for all your earnings releases, we appreciate it. Formulating guidance for this year is probably particularly tricky. You have an election, coronavirus, all these uncertainties, and you just came off a period where sales didn't necessarily meet your expectations. So how did you factor all that in as you were coming up with your Walmart U.S. sales plan for the year? And as part of that, did you assume that your -- you are going to have to invest more in price in order to drive the traffic, recognizing that you already said that more of the price investments will go to general merchandise versus consumables this year. Brett Biggs : Yes. So we put a lot of thought into it, as you can imagine. And it's really the result of a lot of work that goes on with this team over here and how we think about trade-offs around the company. When you look at -- we talked about sales through Cyber Monday were good. Sales in January were good. We started off the year well. The food business around the world continues to be strong. Traffic was up nearly 1% in the U.S. So the underlying part of the business is in good shape. And I think that gave us confidence to give what I think is really the guidance for next year. There's a lot of pieces to the guidance, there are a lot of things that go into that. And will the year end up, will every piece work exactly like we think it will? We know it won't. But within all those moving pieces, we felt good about the guidance that we're giving. Doug McMillon : And low unemployment, relatively low fuel prices, really no inflation in the business, which is interesting. The comps that we're driving result in a lot of tonnage. And so that's great. I think there's room to make the price investments that we need to make across the box, not just in general merchandise in the plan to drive this kind of comp. But we assume that the customer is going to be somewhat in the same place that they're in right now. Daniel Binder : Go to Oliver next. And then we'll come up to Scott after that. Oliver Chen : Just on longer-term eCommerce profitability and main drivers as you think about mix and shipping as well as the consumer pressures around shipping speed and the need for speed. Second question is on robotics and automation. You've been really a pioneer in this space. And rethinking the store, what are some of the priorities in terms of automation and how you'll balance CapEx, both labor savings as well as labor savings opportunities? Doug McMillon : We'll wrap up this morning talking about technology and giving you some examples of things that we're thinking about as it relates to automation. But we do have an opportunity inside the box, grocery picking on the side of the box as well as back in our distribution centers, to add even more types of software and hardware to make ourselves more productive. And I'm excited about that. Brett Biggs : On the eCommerce losses, we're giving this guidance for this year. But we're encouraged, as I said, by what we're seeing in variable fulfillment costs. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in contribution margin as we see the mix change a little bit in that business. We're going to continue to invest in eCommerce. And again, it's up to us as a management team to make sure all the pieces fit together in a way that makes sense for investors. Doug McMillon : Those pieces include first-party, third-party services that support marketplace sellers, the way we manage stores and some of the other areas that we'll mention today. If we're thinking about the whole system, do we think that eCommerce losses will subside in time incrementally as we drive CP improvement and learn how to run an eCommerce business better? Yes. But it'll be a mix of things that will drive the profitability of the company. Brett Biggs : And you've heard me say this before, I'll say it again, which is it gets more and more challenging to try to break these businesses apart and report it that way. I mean, the business is just becoming more and more omni as the customer becomes more and more omni. Doug McMillon : Right. Daniel Binder : We'll hit Scott and Chuck next. And if we could just keep the questions to the quarter and guidance, that would be great. Scott Mushkin : Scott Mushkin at R5 Capital. So I wanted to poke a little bit more at the U.S. grocery business. In particular, it looks like store sales -- well, I'll just say this. It looks like almost all the growth is being driven by omnichannel, which puts some pressure on your business. So how do you resist the temptation to let prices creep up a little bit, maybe take some store-specific labor out? Things that got you guys in trouble a little bit before kind of the reset 5 years ago when, Doug, you took over? Doug McMillon : We just won't let it happen. I mean, we've lived through what that looks like and we're in the stores all the time and paying attention to what hours and structure look like. I think that we would say that over the last year or so, our focus on grocery shifted the store managers' focus and others' focus to really executing in-stock and grocery pick and deliver on the food and consumable side. And it may have contributed some to apparel presentation and general merchandise. So in this business, you got to run the whole box, and we're focused on that and thinking about our staffing that way as we head into next year. As we build new products, I think this is kind of embedded in your question, Scott, launch grocery delivery, charge a membership for it and do other things, we've got to keep an eye on a pure store P&L and make sure that it's not inappropriately subsidizing new businesses. And we do think about that and keep an eye on it as we manage all these variables. I hope that answers your question. Yes. That goes into follow-up. Scott Mushkin : Yes, just quickly. And you guys were really committed to certain price gaps in the consumables business, which have been strong, and we've seen continued investment on that side of the business. Is that still to be expected or not? Doug McMillon : We've made a lot of progress on those things, but maintaining gaps and staying aggressive is in our plan, just not exclusively. Charles Grom : All right. Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. On the coronavirus, we're getting a lot of questions from investors and what's going on over there, and I know a lot of the factories are just starting to reopen. Just how are you -- what are you seeing over there? How big of an impact do you think it could be to your business in the back half of the year, if there are backlogs? And I guess, Brett, just on the $0.02 of potential hit in the first quarter, I guess just to clarify, that's not in your guidance? And I guess, where would that be within the P&L, in the top line or the margin comping? Brett Biggs : Let me start there. Why don't you start? Doug McMillon : Yes, let's start with store operations. I mean, when Judith and her team wake up and maybe you are getting some sleep, they are thinking, first and foremost, about what's happening with our associates? What do they need? Are the stores being run well? Are we taking care of customers to the extent that we can? And we do currently have a majority of our stores with reduced hours. Looking back over the last few weeks, there have been a few times when we've closed a store for a little while. But we like to keep stores open. Customers need us. We do it with hurricanes in the U.S., we're doing it in this situation in China. There's collaboration going on with the appropriate government officials to make sure that we're doing all the things that they would expect us to do. And our team on the ground is doing a great job managing that. The mix shift happened. So if you could imagine yourself in that situation, you're focused on fresh food, you're focused on the staples that you need to have in your apartment or your home all the time, you're not thinking about toys or apparel. So that's occurred. And then another dimension that's changed is delivery's gone up even higher, as you would guess. And so this relationship that we've got with Dada for the last-mile delivery or last-few-steps delivery from the store up to the apartment, those kinds of things, that's enabled us to pick from our stores and do delivery and fuel some of that growth. But it will create a mix change to the P&L and we don't know what's going to happen next. I mean, one of the reasons why we couldn't put it in our guidance is because there's so many moving parts right now, including sourcing coming out of China, not only into the U.S., but into other markets as well. It's important for everybody to remember, in the U.S., we do about 2/3 of our volume with goods made in the United States. That other 1/3 comes from a combination of countries, especially China, Canada, Mexico, a little bit from India, Southeast Asia. So how long would those shipments be delayed? What can we do to buy goods that are already in the U.S. or made in the U.S. to supplement some of that so we don't feel as much of it? All of that work is happening, which makes it really difficult to call how it's going to play out in the quarter. We're not even through the first month yet. So that's why we've made the decision we've made. Brett Biggs : We're trying to make guidance as simple as we could. And so we got in discussions about do we include this? Do we not include that? And so where we had a little more visibility was on the store side. Sales, I'm pleased that we can keep stores open to the extent that we have and be able to serve those citizens, those customers. Sales have been okay in the market, and this really is so far a mix issue. And it's an expense issue as we look at just how to deal with associates and wages and other things. We've got to make sure that we're taking care of people, and so it's led to increased expenses. So I wanted to give you the visibility we had right now, but keeping it out of guidance, we felt was cleaner. Daniel Binder : And we'll go to Chris. Christopher Horvers : Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. First, a sort of year question, then the longer-term question. So first on the year, you talked about mid-20s to mid-30s on the eCommerce growth rate. Around 2.5% -- or 2.5% or more, pretty consistent over the year. What drives the variability around the eCommerce growth rate over the quarters? And then I have a follow-up on gen merch. Brett Biggs : Yes, sometimes on -- any time we have variability for -- in eCommerce or anything we have, it can be something that happened this year. More times than not, where we had, it can be weather, it can be a week or 2 that were better than some. And so it just creates this little bit of timing difference. And it doesn't take much of a change to move something from 25% to 30%. So we want to give you as much guidance as we can along that, but it just doesn't take much impact to make a change. So it's not as variable as it seems when you just look at it mid-20s to mid-30s. Christopher Horvers : And then does the sort of overall U.S. comp, therefore, sort of follow that same flow, how we think about the overall eCommerce growth rate cadence-wise? Brett Biggs : It would be some, but eCommerce is still a fairly small part of that total segment comp number. Christopher Horvers : Okay. And then just longer term, as you think about new head of U.S., new head of merchandising, the push to grow general merchandise. I remember meeting with you, Doug, one time, you talked about, hey, how can we grow gross margin rate when we put general merchandise on sale and we invest in price? How long does it take turn the gen merch business to something more significant? Do you expect the gross margin benefit to sort of, ex 4Q compare aside, to increase throughout the year? Or is that more of a '21 -- 2021 opportunity? Doug McMillon : Yes, I think it's more incremental. And we wouldn't put it on sale, we'd roll it back for at least 90 days, like it wouldn't be too temporary. I think we're -- the way we're coming across is probably being too dismissive of the strength of the general merchandise business in the stores. We have a lot of great merchandise and our teams do a great job across the board in hardlines and in some departments in particular. So there's a strength there to build on. Do I think that GM needs to grow faster than the total in stores and online? Yes. Do I think we've got room to make that happen in terms of the product we select and how we present it in store and online? I do. So I would just expect, over time, these things to get stronger as the team gets really focused on apparel and home and some hardlines categories. And I think the opportunity, both in stores and online, is clear and exciting. But it won't be a 1-quarter switch and it's not that easy. If it was that easy, we would've already done it. Daniel Binder : We'll go next to Kelly. Kelly Bania : Kelly Bania, BMO Capital. Brett, I think you said U.S. EBIT at the higher end of your range, so I think almost mid-single-digit. Can you just help us think about how eCommerce losses do impact that for the year? And maybe just how the FCs versus grocery and the rollout of delivery impact that? And if you can, or maybe if you will today, just over the next couple of years, really think about -- just a candid discussion of how we should think about that. Brett Biggs : Yes, there's a lot of things in that U.S. segment P&L. It's a really big business. And so as you look -- one of the things that's really important and underlies a lot of how we get that profit growth is what we've done on expenses. The business has been very disciplined about how they think about expenses but doing it in a way that's sustainable and doing it in a way that helps customers and associates. So that's different than how we would have managed expenses, I think, in the past. Price goes into that, certainly, from a gross margin perspective. Transportation goes into that. Having eCommerce losses that are flat to potentially a little bit lower helps as we think about profitability growth in the U.S. business. But it's really the combination of a lot of different things inside that business that allows us to grow profit at those levels. But if you get a 2.5% comp in Walmart U.S. on that scale, the amount of leverage you can get from that business is pretty amazing. Daniel Binder : I think we have 2 questions over here, and then we're going to probably wrap it up. Scot Ciccarelli : Scot Ciccarelli, RBC. Can you guys provide a little more detail on the associate disruption that you talked about this morning in today's release? And how much of the EBIT shortfall was due to that headwind? Doug McMillon : I don't know that we've quantified it, but we changed our attendance policy and tied it to our incentive plans and people really showed up to work. And we, of course, anticipated that we would see that, but not to the extent that it happened. Scot Ciccarelli : But I guess the bigger question has to do with kind of like today's employment environment. And is this something that could wind up kind of rolling into calendar '20, '21, et cetera, based on where you are? Doug McMillon : No. Yes, I think those are 2 separate conversations. In a little while, we'll talk about all the things we're doing with associates to attract and retain talent. So let's cover it when we look forward. But that fourth quarter issue was just as I described, it's kind of that simple. Daniel Binder : We have one more over here. Craig Johnson;Customer Growth Partners;Founder: Craig Johnson, Customer Growth Partners. Could you speak -- I'd like to drill down on the traffic issue a little bit. And you showed 265 million customers a week, which I'm assuming you mean transactions a week. Question is, do you understand your customers well enough to know whether you're getting same raw traffic, lower conversion? Whether you're getting few -- more -- less trip frequency of existing customers? And if you're losing share of trip missions, do you know whether you're losing it to the Aldis and Costcos and Trader Joe's of the world? Doug McMillon : Yes, good question. We have a lot of data and have good visibility into where people are shopping, what's happening with us. And I would say, and I'll say it again in a few minutes, the fact that customers that shop us both in stores and online are so much more connected to our brand, spending 2x and spending more in store, is a thing that we're really focused on. So we have a lot of data and we can gather even more data, but I think I know it's going to tell us at the end. If you win their most frequently purchased items, you get the opportunity to serve impulse items online and in-store. And our focus is in driving that sweet spot. Daniel Binder : Great. That wraps up our Q&A session, our first Q&A session. And we'll have a little transition here. And Doug, we'll let you take the stage. Brett Biggs : Thank you. Appreciate it. Doug McMillon : Thank you. We actually have a 15-minute break scheduled for the session, so come back in about 15. [Break] Unknown Executive : Ladies and gentlemen, today's program will resume in 2 minutes. Thank you for taking your seats. Our meeting is about to resume. [Presentation] Doug McMillon : Well, as the video reminds us, we're driving a lot of change across this business and I'm as excited as I've ever been about this company. The combination of our unique strengths and assets, the new ways we can serve customers and the capabilities we're building cause me to feel that way. From our front-line associates to our store managers, tech team and leadership, we have the mindset and culture to adapt. Innovation is happening across the company. We're pleased to see our people solving problems in new ways and with increasing speed. In addition to our strategy to serve customers, I'll share some thoughts on how we're creating opportunities for our associates, our thoughts on technology and the opportunity and responsibility we have to serve multiple stakeholders that Walmart serves, shapes or influences. I'll start today by focusing on the U.S., given how important it is. But you'll see that these strategic themes have implications for our markets outside the U.S. Our list of advantages starts with our supercenters. We have a strong assortment of the best-selling items priced at tremendous values. We're strengthening our fresh food offer and delivering strong pricing and in-stock across all of our food and consumables categories. We have a large and growing pharmacy, optical and OTC business. We're strong in seasonal hardlines. Our home business is performing well, but we have room to improve with apparel. We prefer to sell brands for less, but we're also improving our private brands, and they're growing faster than our overall sales. 18 of them do more than $1 billion in sales. And our largest private brand, Great Value, does more than $27 billion a year globally. Just as with merchandising, we have foundational strengths and room to improve in-store operations. Our team is focused on our people, our processes and our technology to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. We've improved associate education through our academies, and we're seeing retention increase because our associates are better equipped and more confident to do their jobs. We're empowering them with apps on their mobile devices that help streamline their work and put information at their fingertips. We're putting automation in place to help us improve side counter modular accuracy and in-stock. We're testing new technologies that will change how our front ends work and how our distribution centers flow merchandise to stores. We have the best store format in the right locations and we'll keep making them better. We'll keep improving our pickup experience, and we'll build on that capability to further scale delivery. For customers who want it, delivery will extend all the way into their kitchen or garage as we learn how to keep them in-stock on the items they buy all the time. The customer retention rate of our InHome pilot in Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Vero Beach is encouraging and the membership is $19.95 a month. Our EDLP assortment, with its strong opening price and private brand components, underpins a strong customer proposition. And when it's purchased as part of a big basket, which helps with pick and delivery economics, it's compelling for customers, whether it's purchased in store, picked up or delivered. No one else has that assortment so close to so many customers, and having profitable stores that function as pick centers is an advantage. The capital is already placed and well positioned. There's a Walmart within 10 miles of 90% of Americans, within 5 miles of 70% of Americans. And fully half the U.S. population is within just 3 miles of a Walmart. That's a unique position, and we're taking advantage of it. We didn't have a grocery pickup business a few years ago, and now it's huge. We started providing same-day delivery for our customers 2 years ago, and now it's available for more than 1,600 stores, covering more than 50% of the U.S. population. We've been learning to sell memberships for grocery delivery, and that looks promising. We've even built our own delivery platform for independent contractors to complement other delivery providers, it's called Spark. It's now available in 31 states and doing more than 30,000 deliveries a week. Over time and as volumes grow, we'll learn how to pick and deliver locally with more automation. As you know, we've already started with our test of AlphaBot and self-driving vehicles. As we're making the most of our stores, we're strengthening walmart.com. While our customer scores reflect the progress we've made on assortment delivery, we're far from satisfied. It's not only important because customers want access to a broad assortment delivered accurately and quickly, but we need the margin and profitability of a large eCommerce general merchandise business, and that includes a well-run marketplace supported by fulfillment services. Our interests are aligned with our customers and marketplace sellers. The losses we're experiencing today are necessary to build a business model that can compete and avoid being out-mixed. Our data shows that a customer who shops in both stores and through our app or website spends twice as much as a customer who shops in stores only, and they spend more in stores. It's obvious to us that people want to shop a brand in a seamless, omnichannel way that has little to no friction. So we'll keep adding assortment and new brands online. We'll keep growing to leverage our fixed cost and look for ways to intelligently speed up the process. Our assortment acquisitions, such as Shoes.com and Art.com and Hayneedle, which came along with Jet for the home categories, have added category volume and expertise to the company as they've improved customer choice. Jet has enabled us to attract new brands. As we described when we bought it, it's positioned as urban, younger and more affluent than Walmart. We haven't invested in it because of the traction we're gaining with walmart.com and the efficiency of the investment in the Walmart brand versus Jet.com, because we made that pivot, combined it with strong eCommerce grocery growth in the U.S. and other markets and made the investment in Flipkart, we now have a global eCommerce business that should achieve nearly $50 billion in sales in the year we've just begun. Now we've invested a lot to do it, but we're now in a position to play offense to win an omnichannel game. Our opportunity is to weave all this together in a way that grows sales more profitably. We've got a strong set of chess pieces to work with. Last year, I showed you this image of our portfolio. We're turning it into a set of mutually reinforcing businesses that create a stronger flywheel. We see the opportunity to build a next-gen Walmart productivity loop that serves the customer more holistically. The biggest customer funnel into the flywheel will be through those items they buy all the time. But regardless of how they initiate their interaction with our brand, we'll make it easier to experience all of Walmart. As they do, it will enable us to continue growing advertising and financial services. We think we can learn how to drive alternative revenue and profit streams by building on our core businesses. Learning how to build and launch digital products will be key. Beyond advertising and financial services, health care looks like a big opportunity. Given our large pharmacy and optical businesses and our experience with flu shots and other in-store health events, we have something to build on. It's another omnichannel opportunity that takes advantage of big boxes and big parking lots close to people. The early results from our 2 Walmart health clinics in Georgia have shown us that customers welcome us to participate in health care services. I don't want to get too far over my skis here because we're just getting started and we have a lot to learn and do, but after spending time in both of these health clinics, I think there's something here. Our doctors and health care professionals like the incentive structure. They're not being rewarded for sending people to a specialty that they may not need, they're being rewarded for caring for patients, and it shows. It's a small sample size, but our NPS score related to felt cared for is in the mid-90s. We're learning how to equip these clinics with the right people. We'll learn how to support them with the right technology. We'll try various pricing structures. We'll be experimenting with the size and layout. And we'll be exploring opportunities to add digital capabilities that extend outside of the clinics and eCommerce to round out the experience. Our opportunities with health care, financial services and advertising will take time to sort out and scale, but it's clear to us that in an omnichannel world, where people can complement our people-centric physical businesses with new digital businesses, our opportunity to serve customers holistically and profitably expand beyond what we've done before. Now let me take a minute to look further into the future. I think we're headed towards a time when customers won't really think about buying their routine items very often. They will tell us once, or less frequently anyway, and we'll take care of it. As a teenager, I remember my mom leaving our house asking, \"Is there anything you need from Walmart?\" It's apparent to me now she didn't say, \"I'm going shopping. What do you need?\" She wasn't shopping around, Walmart was the default. And as so many of our customers do today, she bought her big basket from Walmart and filled in from elsewhere. Well, the next generation of that is Walmart InHome. Customers will start to think of us like a membership service, where we make sure the items they use all the time are available in their homes. Whether it's that service, the way we design our store offer or the growth of our pickup business, we're out to win the big-basket stock-up trip that's delivered on time at an everyday low price. When it's our job to forecast their demand and keep them in-stock, it's not as important to deliver in a day or an hour. It's just required that their items be there when they need them. Price will matter. Our supply chain will support that strategy. We'll have a human relationship with customers as they interact with our associates, but we'll have a stronger digital relationship that saves them time and makes their experience with Walmart more enjoyable. To create these digital experiences that marry our people, our stores and clubs with our site and app, we're changing how we work inside the company. We're adopting agile, working in small teams to design experiences and solve problems. This change is an unlock to deliver seamless omni, to drive innovation, become more productive and pick up speed. Working this way won't only help us improve our core offer, but it will also help us build and launch digital businesses that eventually form a new business model. Sam's Club provides an early and good example of the benefits of working this way. It's become an innovation hub within the company. The Sam's team has created time-saving innovations, like Membership Express, which enable us to sign up new members in less than a minute. New apps like Sam's Garage allow members to buy tires in a fraction of the time it used to take. And the Ask Sam voice app gets our associates needed answers fast. The technologies we're using to assist our associates and members at Sam's are getting results. We've seen 16 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth in Sam's, excluding fuel, and we have more members now than we had before we closed clubs 2 years ago. Our overall membership count and renewal rates are up year-over-year. As I mentioned previously, a lot of what I've described for the U.S. is relevant across the world. We all want to save time and money. We all want to be pleasantly surprised by finding an exciting new item. Outside the U.S., Judith and team are working together to drive innovation. We offer grocery pickup and delivery or both in nearly a dozen countries. We've got some strong, well-positioned businesses in Walmex and in Canada. Flipkart and PhonePe are scaling quickly with a ton of runway ahead of them as we work to build platforms that support kiranas and small businesses. It's helpful to have built expertise with our cash and carry business in India, too. We have strong leaders in place, they and their teams are being aggressive. We're learning from them as they build out our ecosystem in this important market. In Mexico, we offer same-day delivery of grocery, consumables and thousands of general merchandise items. Gui and the team are building eCommerce capabilities and becoming a digital enterprise. We opened 134 new stores in Mexico last year, bringing our total for Walmex to more than 3,400. We're set up for omni in Mexico. Our business in China, particularly in Sam's Club, has been strong. With respect to Walmart in China, we drove eCommerce growth of 95% as we continue to expand Walmart Daojia and JD Daojia. Daojia, by the way, means to the home, and that's where we're going with an average delivery time of 40 minutes. We own about 10% of JD.com and have an investment in Dada, which provides delivery from our supercenters. Along with the U.S., Walmex, Canada, India and China are our priorities. Beyond those markets, we'll be working to set up other businesses for success. We've shown we're open to alternative ownership structures. You've seen us take action in Brazil and attempt to merge our business in the U.K. We'll be thoughtful about the portfolio, make the right decisions for our associates, our customers and our business. We'll be disciplined about positioning and where we invest in not just geographically. We're making choices as we transform the company. One choice we've made is to get more aggressive with regard to legacy technology. We've been operating and innovating on top of a complex set of global systems. We've decided to speed up the modernization process and do it in fewer years than we had planned even a year ago. Doing so will enable us to drive more innovation, speed and productivity. We'll wrap up our session today talking in more detail about those plans, the implications of which are in the guidance that Brett shared earlier. Now we aren't a tech company. We're a people-led tech-empowered company, but we're out to put tech and data to work. As we do, we'll keep people first. It's our humanity that differentiates us. Our associates' success is the company's success. And we have an opportunity and a responsibility to prepare them for the future of work. The impact of technology on the workplace is amongst the most pressing issues of our time. We design and manage a holistic set of benefits that support our associates, including: A fully loaded hourly wage that's now over $18 an hour, including part-time associates; quarterly bonuses that totaled $730 million last year and were earned by a majority of our U.S. associates; a 401(k) match, where we invested more than $1 billion last year for 650,000 associates; an enhanced parental leave policy that can provide up to 16 weeks of paid time for a birth mom; a $5,000 adoption benefit; and flexible health care plans that start as low as $29 per pay period. Working with partners like the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins, we've created centers of excellence for serious health procedures to ensure the best care. We developed educational opportunities, enabling our associates to be prepared for their current role and prepare them for promotions. We will be a springboard for them. More than 12,000 associates are enrolled in Live Better U. And as of last year, they've completed more than 88,000 course credits which have a total worth of more than $42 million, and it costs our associates about $1 a day. Over the past 5 years, we've made incremental investments of more than $5 billion in training, education and higher pay for store and club associates in the U.S. alone. Without question, investing in our associates is the right thing to do, and we continue to see how our education offerings are paying off. Our commitment to supporting and developing associates isn't limited to the U.S. In fact, the academies we launched in the U.S. were copied from the U.K. In China, we have a program called Retail University that helps associates build new skills. In Canada, we offer tuition reimbursement for associates and their families at accredited colleges and universities. We're bringing our workforce into the future with us. And we're not just focused on customers and associates. We take a multi-stakeholder view. For many years now, we've taken action to benefit the breadth of stakeholders that we serve. Of course, our shareholders are our priority and we know they benefit over the long term as we serve customers well and create opportunities for our associates as we find win-win opportunities with our suppliers and marketplace sellers, invest to strengthen communities and take action to protect our planet. Without a healthy planet and strong communities, there is no business. If associates aren't happy, our customers won't be. When the business roundtable updated our statement on the purpose of a corporation in August of last year, I was surprised by the reaction from some. I'm so accustomed to how Walmart practices stakeholder capitalism that it didn't feel like news that companies balanced the interest of all of our stakeholders. We believe in creating shared value. We're certainly not perfect and there's more we can do as a business community, but there are plenty of companies taking action with tangible plans to do more, and it's the same for us at Walmart. We've accomplished a lot, we've set big goals, and there's still more that we can do. We're leading one of the largest private sector consortiums in the world taking action on climate change. The goal of Project Gigaton is to avoid 1 billion metric tons of emissions from our supply chain. To date, more than 2,300 suppliers are participating, and they report having avoided more than 200 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Within our own operations, we're on track to meet our commitment of an 18% reduction of emissions by 2025, and 28% of our current energy needs are being provided by renewables. In the U.S., we're diverting more than 80% of our waste from landfills and incineration, and we recycled more than 250 million pounds of plastics last year. Our work isn't just environmental. It's broader. Our purchase orders provide inclusive economic growth opportunities. We foster community resilience through disaster recovery. We were included in the Bloomberg 2020 Gender Equality Index for the second year, which is a recognition that we're helping to set example through measurement and transparency of women advancing in the workplace. In short, stakeholder capitalism is good business. Behind me, you can see the talented leadership team that I get to work with every day. Let me wrap up by saying a little bit about those who are in new roles or are new to the company, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. Greg Foran did a great job, and we are grateful. During Greg's leadership, we strengthened our foundation, delivered strong results and build momentum. Air New Zealand is going to be happy to have him. And if you want to have a little bit of fun, follow him on social media. He's up front with the pilot, he's serving drinks down the aisle to customers and he's been washing airplanes and moving luggage. Classic Walmart applied to Air New Zealand. Now John Furner is going to take that foundation and build on it. He has a depth of experience from his 26 years with the company that includes time as a Walmart U.S. store manager, market manager and buyer. He's worked in all 3 operating segments of the company. He led merchandising and marketing in China and he led Sam's Club here in the U.S. He knows the details of our business and yet he's a forward-looking innovator. I've enjoyed watching him embrace new ways of thinking about our business, and I'm excited about the innovation and speed he'll bring to Walmart U.S. Succeeding John at Sam's is Kathryn McLay. Most recently, Kath has been leading our neighborhood markets business in the U.S., which is performing really well. She's from Australia, where she worked with -- for Woolworths with Greg Foran and Roger Corbett, our former Board member, before joining us in 2015. Kath has supply chain, internal audit and operational experience. She's a strong leader, and she will do a great job at Sam's Club. Suresh Kumar joined us from Google in July as our Global Chief Technology and Development Officer. He has 25 years of technology leadership experience that includes 15 years at Amazon plus time at Microsoft before Google. We're excited to have someone of his caliber in this role, and you'll hear more from him a little later. Our newest addition is Donna Morris. She joins us from Adobe, where she had a 22-year career. She'll increase our digital acumen and help us accelerate our transformation. We have a deep bench, but we also understand the benefit of bringing in talented people from outside the company for their expertise and new ideas. As I said before, I'm as excited about this company as I've ever been. There's more opportunity ahead of us than anything we've experienced in the past. We have a meaningful purpose, a set of timeless values and a special culture. We inherit a DNA from Sam Walton that embraces change. We're adapting, and we're doing it from a position of strength with great people and great assets. Our core is strong. We're increasing innovation and speed while demonstrating the ability to execute and deliver results as we transform. We're ready and able to take this company into the next generation of retail, and we thank you for being part of it. Now it's time to hear from our other leaders, and we're going to start with John Furner. John Furner : Good morning. Look, I'm happy to talk to you this morning about the U.S. business. It's an exciting business, an exciting time. And I've been learning a lot in the past 100 days to say the least. But it's been great just to see firsthand all across the country how far the business has come in just the last few years. And it's been a while since I've been in the business, but it's exciting to be back and see the momentum that's going on. So you saw our results, and we had a good year. We grew sales, we leveraged expenses, we grew transactions, we grew ticket, we added same-day grocery pickup to more stores and we're going to continue to do that this year. Overall, we had a strong year with significant momentum in both food and consumables and we've got an opportunity to expand the momentum all across the rest of the store. Now last quarter, as an example, we talked about some of the misses we had in general merchandise. So those are in toys, apparel, media and gaming. You heard about that earlier, and I'll come back to that again in just a few minutes. But I first want to say, this is a really, really healthy business. We've got momentum to build on and we've got a lot to do that we can -- a lot we can do to enhance the customer experience and the way customers use our brand all across the business. And as I look ahead, I'm mindful that we've got to do 3 things : Now first is we've got to build on our strengths; second, we've got to manage our results; and third, we're going to innovate for the future. So I'm going to talk about all 3 of these. So let me take our strengths first. And as I said earlier, and I'm really, really appreciative of what so many great associates that have been on a stage like this before me built all across the country and throughout the business. And I grew up learning about Walmart and our core values at home. My dad worked for the company. So I heard about those values at the dinner table. And those values, things like serving customers, respecting individuals, striving for excellence and then always acting with integrity, I learned about those at home, and it's been great to see those in an associate and how they play out throughout the business. But as I said, I'm appreciative of what's happened in the business the last 5 years. A lot's been done to help us get back to the fundamentals of retail, things like cleaner stores, fresher produce. We've got great quality, private brands. And we've got more efficient processes that are helping us with in-stock and inventory flow. And I'm thankful for the investments that were made in the last 5 years, things like lower prices, eCommerce capabilities. I'm thankful for the investments we made in wages, scheduling, training and the other things for our associates like a benefit -- like benefits. Now these are big investments. And the associate investments, in particular, they put a lot of pressure on our financials. But I want to tell you that those investments, they're paying off. Now first, turnover is down 15% over the last 5 years. Associates are more productive, they're engaged and we've leveraged expenses each of the last 12 quarters. And we've also seen 22 quarters of straight positive sales comps. And that's getting our productivity loop turning again. And this is the model that the U.S. business has always been based on : Growing sales which allows us to leverage expenses, then we can invest back in the business, grow more sales, then it helps us keep growing our profit. And throughout Walmart's history, we've seen that when we get this productivity turning in the right way, that's how we get results. Now regarding the everyday low price component of the model. As a former merchant, I know the value of getting this thing right. So we're going to be really disciplined about EDLP. We've got more price investments planned for this year, and we're going to deliver EDLP in a very sustainable way, focusing on every day low cost. And as you heard earlier, there's been a lot of progress in the last few years to help us become more efficient and leverage expenses, but I still see plenty of opportunities ahead. We're looking in areas like signing, outside services. And we've done some tests where we reduced the amount of signing in stores to give the customers a more clean view of the store and associates a more clean view of the back room. And you can see by this photo of what we're calling the war room, we're taking a look at everything. We're putting everything in one spot. We're testing things in front of customers. And making changes like this, while it enhances the customer experience, on our scale, saves tens of millions of dollars. Now another strength that I want to talk about is the Walmart supercenter. And the supercenter is a really, really important part of our future. And as I step back and look at the supercenter, I see arguably the greatest format in the history of retail. And it's a competitive advantage. We've got the most 100 -- most productive 100,000 items ever aggregated into 1 location, and we're now working to deliver the entire store same-day into customers' homes. Now the supercenter, it's a place that, in many communities, it's central to the community like the heartbeat of the community. It's often one of the largest employers in town. It's one of the largest grocers in town. And it's a shopping format that's powered by one of the most extensive supply chains in the world, and that includes both fresh and general merchandise. Just last year alone, we shipped 8.3 billion cases of inventory, and we did that while being naming -- while being named the safest large fleet in America for the sixth consecutive year. And then when you add in our neighborhood markets and our discount stores, that's over 4,700 locations, putting us within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. So that leads to how we're managing results. Now I know we can take this format to the next level. And to me, the next level is finding ways to serve all of Americans a truly comprehensive end-to-end shopping experience. And that's an experience where they can come into a store; they can stop in a parking lot, pick up a pick-up order; they can have anything that they want delivered to their doorsteps; or they can even have their refrigerator stocked. And for many customers, we know it's going to be a combination of all these things. So that scale that gives us a unique advantage. We serve all of America, including people who are looking for new services that can help them save not only money but save time. And we've got an opportunity to get customers to do even more shopping with us. So I'm -- while I'm committed, of course, to making our stores better, I want you to know I'm just as focused on improving our digital relationship with customers, getting the different shopping options we have to complement each other and work seamlessly. And with something like same-day pickup, I see areas where we can get better and make the experience much more seamless for our customer. Just the other day, my team and I, we decided -- we tried to put an order in that would reflect the way many customers shop in the supercenters. So we tried to order something from sporting goods, apparel and the meat department. And what we found is we had a lot of friction. We've got multiple apps and it's hard to do and it's hard to understand how you pick these things up. And we're going to solve those problems and we're going to make shopping in the supercenter across the box very seamless for the customer. But all that begins, we know with the relationship we have with people when it comes to grocery. Grocery is central to the customer relationship. Now we're delivering strong sales in grocery and we're gaining market share. But to make it an even more quality experience, we're going to continue to focus on even lower prices, fresh innovation, private brands and then convenience. Now I love what I'm seeing in produce. We talked about the improvements over the last few years. And it's -- several times in the last quarter. It's exciting to hear Martin, who leads the produce department, talk about another record sales day. They've got momentum and you can feel the energy when you talk to the team when it comes to items and the way they're taking days out of the supply chain. In the deli, and we've got a new deli concept down the street where we pull the home meal solutions up to the front of the store that makes it easy for customers that come in and get dinner for the family. The meat department, another area where we've really invested in quality, and we've seen the comps accelerate. Private brands, like Doug mentioned. We've got many brands over $1 billion, and the brands are improving. A couple of other things we've done in food in the last couple of years. We've opened a plant in the milk area and dairy, we also opened a meat plant. And these are helping us think through ways that we can provide even more quality to our stores and to our ultimate consumer. Now when I look at general merchandise, I see enhanced quality and value in several places around the store. We've got new private brands like HART in nonelectronics. And their quality levels, typically, you only find in a specialty channel. And we also heard, we've got a lot of strength in home. It's been exciting to see how our store team and our eCom team in home in particular have really worked together to bring customers the best experience, the best items, the best prices. And it's paying off. I'm particularly excited about the investments we've made in our electronics department. We've been successful with televisions and other big consumer electronics categories. But we also mentioned, as the fourth quarter showed, we've got some categories where we've got to do better. And I'll just talk about those for a second. In toys, we started the season with features that we decided were too high on price points. And then our layaway business was softer. We're thinking -- rethinking about the way we go to market with layaway across the country. And then in apparel, as Doug mentioned earlier, our floors reflected too much holiday. We've got work to do with our brands in fashion basics. And when I think about brands like Time and Tru that's on the floor today, we've got to make sure that, as we've narrowed our brands, that every one of our brands has a proper place for the consumer. So we've done a lot of great work over the last couple of years narrowing the brands, but we've ended up pushing into these brands a really wide range of quality levels, price levels and sizing. And we're going to rethink the way we go back to market to make sure our brands are really clear to the consumer. And we've got great gift items that people can buy and give as gifts this season coming up. Which leads me to our new Chief Merchant, Scott McCall. Scott, some of you probably know, Scott's been with the company for 25 years and his entire career has been in the merchandising area. And Scott's led areas like consumables, health and wellness, home, lawn and garden entertainment. And Scott just lives and breathes these items. Scott was telling me the other day he can't walk through an airport without noticing the color of people's luggage or the accessories that they're wearing. And he's always thinking about what else we should be doing to drive sales. But the other thing you should know about Scott is Scott's been a really big driver of the omnichannel experience and he believes in a digital relationship with customers. And Scott's going to help us accelerate that. Now as I mentioned earlier when we talked about price, we're going to continue to invest in food and consumables, but we're also going to consider places to add price investment in general merchandise categories. Now with both grocery and GM, we want to prioritize pricing, but we also want to make sure that we're sourcing in the right way. We know that our customers expect us to make a difference on key global issues and they increasingly care about how items are produced. Now as I look outside the store, I'm going to start with curbside. The U.S. team has built an impressive business with the same-day pickup operation. They've got high NPS scores, we're now in about 3,200 locations, and we'll be expanding to about another 500 locations this year. And we'll continue to see healthy comp growth, not only from the new stores we're adding, but we're seeing healthy comp growth from the stores that have been open for more than 1 year. And the work that's been done in this business is what's made same-day delivery a reality. It's essentially the same process for delivery as it is for a pickup order, it's just the associate is putting the order in a delivery driver's trunk instead of the customer's trunk. And we're now offering same-day delivery in 1,600 stores and we expect that to be in about half the fleet by the end of the year. In same-day delivery, it's what a lot of customers want, and we love our position there. We already have over 100,000 items forward-deployed with just -- within just a few miles of millions and millions of customers' homes. And we've got different options for delivery, things like third parties, associate delivery and we have also launched our own Spark delivery network. And you're going to hear more about that from Dacona Smith just later today. Now when we started our pickup business, we made a really deliberate decision to only pick food and consumables. Most general merchandise items had to be ordered on a separate app, they have to be picked up in a tower or they have to be shipped to home. And we're now already at the point where we can start to combine these experiences and pick the rest of the store and add more general merchandise selection to the pickup for curbside and same-day delivery. And we know our customers are asking for that as well. So as we pick more and more of the GM in the supercenter for same-day, that's going to help us do things like expand the size of the basket, it will help us with margin mix in the basket and it would just be great for a customer to be able to order their groceries and also pick up an HDMI cable or a sweater or something that can top off the entire basket. And we're going to make that happen. But we think this will also help our perception as a destination for general merchandise, which leads to the longer tail in eCommerce business that Marc will talk about in a few minutes. So we know we can increase our wallet -- our market share, our wallet share on the head of the assortment and then we can walk all the way through the assortment as we get into eCommerce. Now as I look ahead, I want to prepare our business for the future. And a lot of time in the team, we say that loyalty in retail is the absence of something better. So we're going to race with everyone else out there who wants to provide something better for our consumer. And we want to be best positioned from now and into the future to win with the customer. And as you've heard, the U.S. team, they've built a lot of tools that have helped us reach new customers. They've helped us become more efficient. And they've moved quickly to scale a lot of these new technologies. So at the last Analyst Day, for example, you heard about some of the concepts around just a few stores, things like shelf-scanning robots, autonomous floor scrubbers. And you heard about the FAST unloaders earlier this year. Well, by the end of this year, we'll have the shelf-scanning robots in over 1,000 stores and the FAST unloaders will be in more than 2,000 stores. And I'm also excited about something you've heard mentioned, that's the AlphaBot technology. We're testing this in Salem, New Hampshire. And this technology allow -- eliminates the need to handpick individual items from store aisles. It's made our associates in Salem more productive. It's greatly increased the number of same-day orders that can be processed at a certain time. And this year, we're going to expand that to a couple more sites. In the last few years at Sam's Club, I learned the power of new technology tools. And a good example that you've heard about is Ask Sam. And Ask Sam lets an associate open a single app, speak questions into their phone, things like, \"What aisle is the Nutella on?\" or \"Who's working in the bakery today?\" To get answers. It runs on voice, and voice is a big idea, not only for associates, but also to customers. So associates in our stores today, they're working across a site that's over 4 acres in size. So there's a lot of time spent going back and forth getting answers or getting something that you need to complete a task. And by using voice and mobile, we're able to get the associates the information they need to save a lot of the time they spend walking back and forth. And this is going to help them free up more time that they can serve our customers. But I don't want to miss the idea of voice because voice is a big idea that could help customers and associates with everything from maps, finding items, shopping lists. All across commerce, it's a really big idea for us. And the reason that I think Ask Sam was so successful is it was designed from the very start to serve the end customer. And serving the end customer, that's something we want to refer -- that we refer to as having a product mindset. And when I say the product mindset, I don't mean product like an item, like a soccer ball or pair of socks, I mean product like a technology product that helps us identify points in the experience where there's friction, friction for customers, friction for associates. And then we go back and work on processes and technology and then we iterate on that so that we can ensure that we're eliminating the friction and making our experiences for both of those key end users very, very seamless. And this is a big opportunity for the Walmart U.S. business. So whether you're in our stores, the distribution centers, the corporate offices, we need to be even more customer-driven. We need to think in ways that make the end user have a better experience. So we can look at the things we're prioritizing, how we're working and even some of the cultural behaviors we have inside the business. Now we're still going to run one great store at a time, that won't change. But it's clear that great stores are an important part of the solution, and we've got to expand our thinking to think about the entire solution in all the different ways that a customer wishes to be served in today's market. And we're going to keep the customer at the center. So we'll also be looking at new profit streams, ideas like services and things that help leverage the popularity and the power of the Walmart supercenter. We're testing partnerships with FedEx, Budget Rent  a Car, Build-a-Bear, veterinary clinics, esports gaming areas. And you've seen our experiments with health and wellness, you've seen the things we've done in pharmacy, we're working on our optical business to modernize the look and feel of optical and then the full-service health care clinics in Dallas and Calhoun, Georgia. We want to be able to learn quickly how we can deliver quality medical, dental, optical and even mental health services at an affordable price. And we think this is especially a great idea in communities where health lacking and out of reach for many. And finally, we can't run a great business without our people. Our associates are the key to our future and our associates are our competitive advantage. And I see that every time I'm in stores, distribution centers, corporate offices, fulfillment centers, all around the country, I see what an advantage our associates are for Walmart. And we want our associates to have a great experience while they work, the ability to learn and grow a career, opportunities get in education, things like Live Better U and academies. And in past positions, I've learned the value of investing in key positions, things like senior merchants, technologists, store leadership teams, department managers. Those investments are important, and we're going to be targeting specific about the way we invest in our people because we've got to not only attract but retain the very best talent for our customers.  So that's what I'm seeing in the first 100 days. And as I take on this responsibility with over 1.3 million associates, 4,700 locations, I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead. But we've got opportunities where we can do more. We've got opportunities to serve more customers in the way they wish to be served. We've got opportunities to bring more momentum to the entire store, including delivering general merchandise same day. We've got opportunities to build technology and keep the end user in mind as we design solutions that solve their problems, so I think there's a ton of upside. I'm really excited about the customer experience we intend to build and the results in the next few years and months.  Thank you for your time.  [Presentation] Marc Lore : Good morning. Thanks for being here. Here's what I'd like to cover this morning. First, I want to recap FY '20 and share what we expect for this year. Next, I'll share an update on our strategy, especially how we're leveraging our unique assets to play offense. And finally, I'll walk you through a couple of projects we're excited about that have the opportunity to shape the future of retail. So let's take a look at how we did last year.  We said we'd grow sales about 35%, and we exceeded that by growing 37%, nearly tripling the size of the business over the last 3 years. We also improved contribution profit margins by about 150 basis points year-over-year. A shift in product mix for categories like home and apparel, lower variable cost per unit and fewer packages per order, all helping us make progress here. Though our 35% growth was strong in Q4, we know we need to do more with delivery, speed and merchandising. Our top line growth was better than expected, and that put pressure on fulfillment and ship speed, which led us to back off our shipping promises, which left sales on the table.  This year, we'll be laser-focused on delivering faster and longer into the holiday season, and we'll continue to improve our merchandising. We added a lot of brands, and we'll continue to grow our assortment and gifting categories, in addition to more home and apparel. And looking ahead, we expect to grow eCommerce sales by about 30% this year. Quarterly growth is expected to range, as Brett said, between the mid-20s and mid-30s. So now let's take a look at our eCommerce strategy. At a high level, we continue to focus on 3 areas : nailing the fundamentals, leveraging unique assets to play offense and innovating for the future. Over the last few years, you've seen how the pieces of this puzzle fit together, and it's still how we think about the business today. We look at nailing the fundamentals in terms of how we perform across the 5 bellwether metrics of the CVI.  We've made good progress across all 5 metrics, but I'm most proud of what we've done to improve delivery speed. 3 years ago, the average Walmart.com package took 5 days to arrive. Today, it's 2 days. We've done a lot to make this happen. We started a few years ago by offering free 2-day shipping, and most recently, we launched next-day delivery. We're able to offer next-day in a cost-efficient way by mirroring inventory in our warehouses. Our cost to deliver next-day is lower because the inventory IS shipped in one box and is close to the customer. And we can reach 75% of the U.S. in 1 day with a broad and growing assortment.  At the same time, both on-time delivery and in-stock rates have increased dramatically over the last 3 years. We've achieved all this by overhauling our supply chain and building out a new team. This is why the CVI score keeps going up. They increased our score by more than 20 points since FY '17, which in turn has improved each element of the customer value prop. And to keep improving the score, we'll have to continue the progress we're making on other fronts, like expanding our first-party offering. That's really our habit metric, and we're doing a lot here. Over the last 3 years, we added 7,500 new brands, acquired companies like Shoes.com, Moosejaw and Art to quickly help expand our assortment on Walmart.com, and we're adding more all the time. We now offer about 3/4 of the top 500,000 items in the overall retail market.  In addition to first party, we're also expecting to improve CVI by expanding our marketplace. The assortment on Walmart.com has grown to about 80 million SKUs, including marketplace, as we remain focused on keeping the quality of items high. And as a result, the marketplace business has grown by 2.5x since FY '17. However, this is an area, as Doug mentioned, where we still have a lot more work to do. While customer and seller NPS scores are improving, we also want to make selling easier. Sellers are telling us they want more options. And not all sellers have the same capabilities, especially when it comes to fulfillment. So that's why we're introducing Walmart fulfillment services. We shipped our first WFS order in August last year. The tech on the back end looks well. Our merchants are excited, and we like what we see so far. Sellers wanted as many channels to sell as possible and WFS gives them another option. And it gives customers faster delivery, more assortment and better pricing. We're really proud of the experience we've built, and it's something we plan to scale over time. The fundamentals of our eCommerce business are improving but as you heard today, it's not enough to do the basics right. We need to leverage our unique assets and start playing offense. Take our 4,700 stores. As John said, this gives us a huge edge in being able to do delivery in an efficient way. Our existing footprint is already within 10 miles of 90% of the population, and we have forward-deployed inventory, which is the really expensive part. In this case, stores are already operating as warehouses. They're profitable and there's a low marginal cost for someone to pick the items. It's our existing assets like our stores that allow us to offer a service like same-day delivery to customers at such an incredible value. Customer can pay $98 a year and get unlimited fresh, frozen, bakery, pantry staples, consumables and select general merchandise delivered to their door for free. Our 1,600 stores that are doing delivery already reached 1/2 the U.S. population. And what we're finding is that delivery customers spend more overall with Walmart, just like our pickup customers. So now in terms of long-term growth, we've seen an opportunity to hook customers on the convenience of services like same-day delivery. As they come to rely on them, we could expect to see them buy more general merchandise, health and wellness services and more.  At the same time, we're making shopping with us even easier. For example, we're combining the Walmart.com grocery app into one. Today, we have what's called the blue app and the orange app. The blue app is the traditional Walmart.com direct-to-home e-commerce app, while the orange app is for online grocery. With 2 apps, we're now able to leverage the traffic from the head of the assortment, the relationship we've built with the customer through grocery, to sell more long tail items, plus we're spending marketing dollars to send customers to 2 different places. So later this year, we'll bring these 2 apps together so the customer sees and interacts with OneWalmart. Walmart is playing offense. We're leading with grocery and same-day delivery to become the primary destination for all weekly shopping. We see this as a critical step to win a greater share of wallet.  So what's next? The third piece of our eCommerce strategy is about innovating for the future. We're exploring opportunities around conversational commerce, augmented reality, virtual reality, delivery into the refrigerator and incubating digitally native brands. As you heard, we've innovated to define the retail experience of the future to anticipate it, to shape it, take InHome delivery. It's our latest innovation aimed at giving time back to busy families by delivering fresh groceries and everyday essentials directly into their kitchen or garage. After initial testing that proved the concept, we rolled out a large pilot in Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Vero Beach in October.  We're on the leading edge of something really big here. InHome is a powerful and effortless experience and we want to grow it. We're exploring enhancements like delivering items automatically before you even realize you're running low. For customers who spend 1 hour a week shopping for food, this could save a ton of time. And we're looking at ways to leverage this new InHome relationship with customers like no-box delivery and returns. We're all accustomed to having to open a box when we have something delivered and then we have to discard it or recycle it. But instead of getting a product in a cardboard box, imagine Walmart leaving the item on your kitchen table, or you can leave the item you want on your island and we'll pick it up when we bring in your groceries. No need to print a return label or put the package in a box.  Needless to say, we're just starting to unlock the possibilities of what this service can be. Customers who've tried it already love it. InHome graduated from our innovation incubator story is now part of the customer organization led by Janey Whiteside, our Chief Customer Officer.  An innovation mindset has taken hold at Walmart. And we're dreaming of concepts, we're testing them, we're piloting them and iterating them, speeding up the time between concept and delivery. But not all these things are going to work, and that's okay. We're going to learn. We'll pivot.  Another area we're investing is conversational commerce. It wouldn't surprise me in 20 years that the majority of shopping is done by text and voice. But the machine needs to know the right questions to ask so you can get the right answers. When you ask your voice assistant to send a text to order diapers, it needs to know that your preferred brand is Hello Bello and that it's size 2. We began building this engine with Jetblack and tested it here in New York City. We learned that customers really responded and loved the ability to text. In fact, members use this service nearly 10 times a week. It allowed us to understand what types of items people want to purchase by text : groceries, birthday gifts, things like that. We're building machine-learning capabilities that can help understand the message you send and make recommendations in 1, 2 or 3 best answers.  As we build capabilities like we have in Jetblack, we're presented with strategic options. We did consider spinning it out, and there was a great interest from the investor community. We also thought about investing more in the New York offering. But the real opportunity for customers and shareholders is when we can scale these innovations with the mother ship Walmart and Walmart.com.  So what's next? While we're going to take those insights and leverage them against the store base in a way that's scalable and sustainable, we've infused our learnings from Jetblack into our customer or within Walmart U.S., and we'll be taking these learnings to Bentonville, Pittsburgh and Kansas City in the coming months. Think same-day shipping from a supercenter or next day from Walmart.com. We all text. It's shopping in a way that's completely natural to customers, and it's an exciting opportunity for us.  We also have a start-up called Insperience, dreaming up ways to integrate virtual reality into retail. VR has the potential to transform the shopping experience. Imagine shopping without space constraints and being able to experience products before you buy them, that's what we call v-commerce. All it takes us a headset to instantly transport a customer to a world where they interact with the merchandise in a natural environment, like being in your living room while you design it. Let's take a look.  [Presentation] The possibilities are very exciting. We're moving quickly, and you could expect to see experiences like this in a few of our stores really soon.  As retailers improve speed, assortment and price, we believe the game will need to shift to original proprietary content as being one of the main differentiators between retailers. Customers want amazing products, and those products will influence their choice of retailer. Earlier, I mentioned how we acquired a number of brands to quickly grow our assortment like Shoes, Moosejaw and Art. Those helped us add assortment on Walmart.com. But beyond growing our assortment, we also acquired a few digitally native brands, like ELOQUII and Bonobos, that help us differentiate our assortment. These aren't just private label brands. They have a soul, a social media following. They give us the DNA to create these digital native brands in-house. You've seen us do it with the launch of Scoop in fashion and with Allswell. Allswell is a mattress brand that offers products at a price point that allows us to put them on Walmart.com and in stores. We started off with just a little bit of capital, and we think it will approach $100 million brand this year. Allswell was the \"aha\" for us. We realized that we can create these brands and incubate them in a way to make them successful across stores and online. We're integrating our digitally native brands like Allswell into the company, and we're going to keep moving in that direction.  As I wrap up today, there are lots of reasons to be excited about eCommerce at Walmart. Our team is aligned on a winning strategy, and the response from customers shows that we're making great progress. We're working hard to monetize the relationship with the customers through a better mix and by selling more long tail categories. Building on the momentum of FY '20, we expect to grow about 30% this year and continue to improve CP margins as well, as Brett mentioned, losses for this year will be flat to slightly lower. We're delivering growth and building a healthier business overall.  I talked about a lot of initiatives today. Some are tests, some are pilots, some are scaling. Walmart is an innovation engine, and all the things I've talked about today are included in the guidance. As I said, we're moving faster, gaining leverage, getting the fundamentals right and playing offense to win primary destination. And while we're doing all this, we're working hard to shape the future of retail.  I'm really excited about the year ahead. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Great. Thanks, Marc. So that will conclude the morning session or the early morning session. We're going to take a 15-minute break, and we'll be back with the rest of the program. Thanks.  [Break] [Presentation] Judith McKenna : Good morning, everybody. I'm really pleased to have a few minutes to talk to you today about Walmart International. I'm going to briefly cover last year's results, a brief look at our outlook for FY '21. But I want to spend most of my time talking about bringing to life strong local businesses that are powered by Walmart by talking about 4 examples of just that.  Walmart International is $124 billion business. It makes us a top 5 global retailer in our own right. We operate more than 6,000 stores across 26 different countries, and those stores are at the absolute heart of our business. But just like the U.S., omnichannel and eCommerce are becoming an increasingly important part of our growth. In fact, last year, eCommerce sales for the total of International were 10% and are expected to reach 12% of our total sales this year.  Now across our markets, we operate a variety of businesses, banners, channels and formats. And what I can tell you is that one size does not fit all. We will not be successful by thinking like a multinational business. But we'll continue to be successful by thinking like a multi-local business. Executing our strategy, one country and one business at a time.  So let me reflect briefly on FY '20. Our sales grew at 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which was another solid year of growth, underpinned by strong performances from Walmex, where the top line grew at 5.2%, and China, where we grew sales by 4.3%. Now Brett's already talked about some of the factors in our results for last year, and he mentioned specifically Chile and that impact. All I want to add to that is my huge appreciation for our teams there who have done and continue to do some incredible things and an incredible job under some very challenging circumstances.  I was personally pleased to see around the world that all of our businesses displayed strong cost control last year, and we leveraged 35 basis points of SG&A through innovation and through operational focus, and our Japan and China markets led the way.  Now I'm sure that you'll all be pleased to know, as you heard from Brett, that Flipkart performed in line with our expectations and was within the guidance that we gave to you. And just as a reminder, International has a December year-end, and the ownership of Flipkart only annualized last year in August. And that fact alone accounted for the majority of our year-on-year decline in segment profit.  But let me turn now to FY '21. There is no doubt that the levels of volatility around the world are higher than they've been for some time. We faced some tough environment -- some tough trading environments. But our EDLP position, our low-cost base and our ability to leverage innovation and best practice position us really well. As a result, this year, Walmart International expects to grow top line by 4%, with profit broadly flat year-on-year. And those numbers do include the continued cost of rebuilding and reopening stores across our Chilean business.  Now Brett and Doug also mentioned, and we talked about the coronavirus. In addition to the comments that you've already heard, let me tell you this, that Yuen Tan, our CEO there, and his team are working extraordinarily hard to serve our customers with their daily needs while, at the same time, taking every precaution for our customers and for our associates. Today, all of our stores remain open, albeit the vast majority of them with restricted hours and some have got restricted operations. The spirit and determination of our teams across our stores, our supply chain and in our home office is remarkable. And at times like these, our people really do make the difference.  But in a certain time, being a trusted retailer has never been more important. And you earn trust, you earn trust by standing tall in difficult circumstances. But you also earn it every day by providing customers access to what they want, when they want it and however they want it, and by innovating to make their lives easier. For me, this really comes to life at a local level. And let me give you 4 examples of strong local businesses who are doing just that.  I want to start with Walmex. It's one of our longest-standing International businesses and probably one of the best examples of what a strong local business looks like. Walmex operates around 4,000 -- 3,400 stores across Mexico and 5 Central American countries. Last year, its sales were $33 billion, and it has an operating margin of over 8%. Listed on the Mexican Bolsa, it has a capitalization of just under $55 billion. And to put that in context, it's just slightly less than Target's market cap. Or if you want to think of it in terms of international retailers, it's more than the market caps of Tesco and Carrefour combined.  In Mexico itself, our supercenters and Sam's Clubs, adapted for the local customer as well as locally developed discount formats, provide inclusion and in-access for all demographics. And in fact, our Bodega formats have reached a remarkable milestone of 2,000 units this year. The proximity and breadth of our formats give us own matched access. And for example, across Mexico's big cities, 85% of the population live within 10 minutes of a store. And that's just one of the factors that enabled us to deliver comp sales growth faster than the market there for 20 quarters straight.  But Gui Loureiro and his team are continuing to find ways to grow the business by leveraging our store network to increase access and reach with a growing omnichannel offer. And I'll share 2 examples of this that I really like. First is in our Bodega stores. We're installing digital kiosks to serve customers who are looking for value but may not have easy access to the Internet or the ability to pay in store. A customer can shop the full range of Walmart online general merchandise from the kiosk in the store, pay in the store and pick up from there later. And the average kiosk purchase is 15x the average ticket in store. It's simple, it's effective, and it's truly inclusive.  The second example of expanding reach is in our supercenters, where we've expanded pickup and same-day delivery options for online grocery. Last year, the team trialed 12,000 general merchant items picked in-store, available for same-day delivery, in addition to the 33,000 grocery items that are already available. That expanded range is now live in 167 of our supercenters, and we have plans to add more by the end of the year.  Moving forward, Walmex will build on its foundations, developing its ecosystem, for example, through its cash repayments app to expand customer access and loyalty. But let me turn next to China. Similar to Walmex, Walmart China's foundations are built on a successful local adaptation of the Walmart and Sam's Club formats. Today, Walmart China is a $10 billion business, with 1/4 of those sales -- over 1/4 of those sales coming from Sam's Clubs. We're fortunate enough to have a well-established brand with 26 clubs with strong brand equity. We opened 3 clubs there last year, and we plan to open 5 more clubs annually going forward. Now in FY '20, Sam's Club China delivered its second consecutive year of double-digit comp growth. And a little known fact is that our highest sales club or store anywhere in the Walmart world is actually our Shenzhen Club, which is located close to our home office.  Now although we're really pleased with that level of growth, we recognize there is a need for continuous innovation to accelerate accessibility. Land is at a premium, but we're finding asset-light ways to supplement our bricks-and-mortar with new infrastructure that improves our ability to engage with members digitally. The heart of the omnichannel expansion has been Sam's many fulfillment centers, which we are calling cloud depots. Think of these as low-cost, mini-distribution nodes in high-density urban areas, which extend online access to our members for about 1,000 of their most frequently purchased products. They're set up with our crowd-sourced delivery last mile partner, Dada, and it allows customers and members to receive their orders in less than 1 hour. But the good news is that members still love visiting our Clubs, but the clouds enable a more frequent shopping mission. And today, we've got about 60 of them, with plans for many more in the future.  Let me show you briefly how they work. [Presentation] So omnichannel is critical for Sam's in China. And today, around 30% of our membership shops both online and off-line. And encouragingly, for us, their renewal rates for those members are higher than the average. Sam's Club China is a great example of taking one of our formats and building such strong local business through strong roots, tailored to the local customer.  So I've covered now 2 of our longest-standing international markets. Let me move to perhaps our 2 most recently added, Flipkart and PhonePe. We made our investment there 18 months ago, and we continue to be impressed by the business, both with the teams, their strong culture and the way that they operate. I've been to India 5 times last year and I never cease to be amazed by the energy, the spirit and the entrepreneurialship of the folks in our businesses. Now just as a reminder, the group consists of the Flipkart eCommerce business, which includes Myntra, which is a separate fashion platform, and PhonePe, a digital platform anchored in payments.  At the last Investor Day, I talked to you about Flipkart, and I'm going to give you a brief update on that today, but also talk to you a little bit more about PhonePe as well. We've been really pleased with Flipkart's performance, and Brett has even given me permission to share a few numbers with you at today's event. I can tell you that the health of the platform is strong. Engagement with Flipkart is continuing to grow as Indian customers become more and more comfortable with eCommerce and the access and affordability that it's providing. Flipkart is now tracking to over 1 billion visits per month. And last year, monthly active customers grew by around 45%, and transactions per customer increased by 30%. What I really love is that Flipkart's heritage puts the Indian customer right at the very heart of the business. Their strategy is simple, it's to democratize shopping by offering affordability and access. And they're using technology and data to solve everyday customer problems in ways that are tailored specifically for the Indian market. They're launching things like innovations such as voice-assisted transactions and vernacular capabilities in Hindi. That helps drive further adoption in Tier 2 cities, which are at the very heart of middle India. They're also offering trading programs, in which we buy back customers' old devices and appliances when they purchase new ones. We also then refurbish those devices and offer them through resale, creating real value throughout the supply chain.  They also look to offer value-added services, including demonstration and installation for large appliances. Only 10% of families in India own a smart TV, a washing machine or an air conditioner. And when they're sold on our platform, we use delivery as a moment to help teach customers and give them confidence in how to use those new products. That, in turn, drives confidence in Flipkart. And to help affordability for customers, Flipkart provides access to credit, including buy now, pay later, low-cost installment credit and this year, launched a co-branded credit card with Axis Bank.  Now in addition to those customer-facing innovations, Flipkart's continuing to use data and insights to find new revenue streams, such as through digital advertising, which grew strongly year-on-year. They're a combination of high-quality data, unique customer behavioral insights and a powerful tech platform mean that ad placement is specific and accurate. And that, in itself, creates value for advertisers, but it -- very importantly, it protects the customer experience. Flipkart's ambition is to serve the next 100 million customers and I love the fact that Kalyan, our CEO, and the team, continue to put the building blocks in place to do just that.  But now let me talk about PhonePe. PhonePe's ambition is to be India's largest transaction platform anchored in payments. They build scale by offering person-to-person money transfer and remittances, expanding use cases with merchants and then adding services for customers to grow their money, all in a single app. PhonePe's DNA is to build open and intelligent platforms. It's an open ecosystem for customers, merchants and banks with the tech take capabilities to automate and scale efficiency. That DNA is actually what's key to PhonePe's remarkable journey. This business is just 3 years old. And in that time, it's grown to almost 200,000 registered users. 20 million of them are using the app on a daily basis. And in total, those users are making more than 500 million monthly transaction. Today, that's generating about $180 billion in annualized TPV, or total payments value.  But PhonePe's also expanded to merchants. 18 months ago, when I first went to PhonePe, they were accepted by about 30,000 merchants in India. Today, they're accepted by 10 million, from kirana mom-and-pop stores to fast food chains and to rideshares. People like using PhonePe. Well over 90% of daily customers repeat within 30 days. The customers using that increased scale combined with data science to reduce costs. One example is there are more than 90% reduction in cost per transaction and person-to-person and reach our categories.  But PhonePe is not stopping there. The team is relentlessly innovative. In January alone, they had 4 new project releases. And one of those that I really like is PhonePe ATM product. It's a revolutionary solution that's got the potential to transform access to cash in India. A customer can now request a cash withdrawal directly from their bank on their PhonePe app. Go to a merchant that's local to them, that merchant will then verify the transaction on their app and give them the cash that they've requested. The service is available today in over 1 million stores across the PhonePe network. When you think about it, there are only 200,000 ATMs today in the whole of India. So this product just scaled the capability to withdraw cash for customers by 5x. It's a win for customers, the merchants and the bank. Samir and Rahul, the CEO and CTO and the founders of PhonePe, are building a business that continues to learn as it grows. And you're going to hear more about PhonePe and the creation its powerful super app from Karthik on the panel later. But I'm going to leave you with this, that at its core, PhonePe is a massive open transactions platform. It took the business its first 2 years of life to reach the 1 billion transactions mark. But last year, it crossed 5 billion transactions. We're really excited about its future.  So not only do those 4 businesses that I've talked about continue to grow, but we continue to learn from them as well and to share best practice across our markets. They're great examples, all of them, of strong local businesses, which earn trust by consistently delivering value by providing customers access to what they want, tailored to how they want it. And they remain at the forefront of innovations that make customers' lives easier.  Our businesses make up a strong global portfolio, and we continue to be thoughtful about how to position each to be as successful as possible. Now that means we avoid a rigid approach to ownership. And we leverage strategic partnerships wherever they can make our business stronger. In some cases, we're a majority owner. In others, we're a minority partner. Our businesses can be private or public, a part of a strategic collaboration with strong partners such as Rakuten, Advent, JD or Dada. And before you ask, I have nothing new on this to tell you today.  Success in this environment for us depends on having a multi-local approach. And I hope you've seen that our businesses everywhere look very different in different markets. What's really exciting in the way that we move forward is being powered by Walmart becomes a reality. From adapting formats and sharing best practices, from developing talent to sharing and building an innovation of culture. What I can tell you is that our business is changing along with the expectations of our customers everywhere that we operate. This year, $1 out of every $8 of international revenue will come from eCommerce. In every market, our customers are pivoting to the future faster than ever before, and we're well positioned to make the most of that shift. We're building strong local businesses, and we're increasingly unlocking the power of Walmart.  Thank you. [Presentation] Kathryn McLay : Good morning, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to talk to you about Sam's Club and why we remain excited about the direction of our business.  So I've been enrolled for just under 100 days, and I've spent dozens of hours talking to our associates and our members to find out what's working in Sam's Club and what's not. And a few things came through loud and clear. First of all, our associates love working for Sam's Club. And secondly, our members are passionate about their club, and we have real momentum in the business. But what I also learned is that our people are ready to do more. Our associates want to get behind great items. They want to leverage even more technology, and they want to create the best member experience in the warehouse channel. And our members' passion for Sam's Club means their expectations are higher than ever. They have paid to shop with us so they do truly expect something special. So while there's work to do, I'm encouraged by where we are today. We have a strong business, and we are well positioned to win. But more on that in a bit.  First, let me briefly touch on our results. You heard us talk earlier today about our fourth quarter and full year results. So for the full year, our comp sales, excluding fuel and tobacco, increased by 3.8%, and our eCommerce sales grew by 32%. And I'm really proud of the team for delivering comps of 9.5% on a 2-year stack basis. We continue to be encouraged by our membership trends, plus renewals and sign-ups drove membership income to grow at 2.5%. So overall strength on the top line, combined with an increase in membership income, resulted in an operating income growth for the full year of 8%, including fuel. So what that means is we achieved a really healthy operating income growth while, at the same time, strategically investing into people, price and technology. So today, the business is positioned financially to continue to provide strong value and convenience, while transforming the shopping experience for our members, both in club and online.  And there's a good reason for that strength. The Sam's Club model is pretty simple. And that's why it works. We offer great items at disruptive prices and a seamless shopping experience. That's what drives membership, and membership is what drives Sam's Club. This basic formula is powered by a strategic focus on people, product and digital as well as an obsession with serving our target member, a family with an income of around $100,000 and 2 or 3 kids. So that strategy won't change because it's working, both member counts and renewal rates are improving. But you'll see us take it up a notch and focus on how people, product and digital come together to drive a great member experience, both in club and online. We've told our members to expect something special, and we will continue to deliver on that promise. With our people, we've fundamentally changed the way work gets done in our clubs to provide a better member experience as well as opportunities for our associates. Last year, we organized our associates into 4 working groups : member, merchandising, fresh and specialty to move towards a more team-based approach. We've consolidated our job codes, we've simplified the work, and we've cross-trained to ensure every associate can complete the basic task of each team. So for example, on the member team, we no longer have associates who purely run the cash register. Instead, we have a frontline member associate who knows how to sell membership, who knows how to work the exit and helping club pick up. We've also moved all of our overnight associates to work during the days when our members are actually shopping with us, and we've raised our hourly wages in more than a dozen key areas like team leads, meat cutters and cake decorators. And we're seeing improvement in our results with reduced turnover and increased employee satisfaction. And we're giving associates tools to make their jobs easier. I was in North Carolina recently, and I spoke to a bunch of associates in a club. And I said to them, \"What's working in clubs?\" And their answer was in unison, technology. Associates now have more information on their mobile device at their fingertips than ever before, meaning they can spend more time on the sales floor with our members serving them. Let's move to products. Sam's Club is an item business. We have limited SKUs, so it's critical that every single item feel hand selected to delight our members while delivering value and quality. Before I talk about some of our specific products, I want to briefly touch on our efforts to reduce our SKUs and to further invest into price. As club merchants, it's our job to find the best items and make the right choices for our members. Members don't come into Sam's Club expecting to find everything. They expect to find value, quality or something that they just can't find somewhere else. And our members are busier than ever, and they're telling us they have more choices than ever. So we consider curation, a member of -- a benefit of membership. In the past year, we've reduced SKUs in about half of our clubs, and it might seem kind of counterintuitive, but actually, our members give us better marks on breadth of assortment when we have less SKUs in the club. Members actually perceive we have more items when we present them with less. It's good for business, too. Our sales are up, and our labor hours are down. So looking ahead, our plan is to continue to refine our SKU count across the business. The other component of membership value, is, of course, price. We've invested in price in a significant number of our clubs. Traffic in those clubs is growing, and our members are responding. We're going to continue to assess price investment and target it over the next year. Moving to items. We have this great opportunity to make Member's Mark special, and we are. But before I talk about that, I want to talk about some work we've been doing with our private brands, and I will share with you 2 examples of how we partner with national brands to create unique items. Our item obsession has led to an increased innovation with our suppliers to bring new products to market, and suppliers are excited to partner because they're sharing in the growth with us. Let's take a look at our recent collaboration with Kellogg's that brought Baby Shark cereal to homes across the country. [Presentation] Kathryn McLay : Good luck getting that song out of your head. We brought another example with us, our delicious popcorn partnership with leading candy brands. So one of our merchants first discovered Candy Popcorn in an airport. It had no presence in grocery or mass retail, and we worked with the supplier to improve the formula and bring the first flavor, Butterfinger, to the club. Our members loved it, and we've continued to innovate every quarter by working with the supplier to bring Twix with -- and our latest Oreo to market. Sam's Club has exclusivity on this series for the first 13 weeks, and we have more amazing flavors planned. I hope you enjoy -- there's some on your table. I hope you enjoy it as much as our members have actually enjoyed it. Our Member's Mark brand continues to produce innovative items at amazing quality and prices while strengthening our overall assortment. We know that Member's Mark -- sorry, members who purchased Member's Mark are more likely to renew with us, so we'll continue to invest in the brand across the box. Last year alone, we improved 383 items and launched 334 new products. Take our updated patio sets, for example. Jon Odell is a senior merchant who work with Member's Mark team to completely reinvent our product line to appeal more to our target member. Jon has deep experience in the outdoor category, and he knew our members wanted high-quality construction and fabrics at a warehouse club price. All sets are handwoven by master weavers. You must apprentice for years to earn that title, and the weaver can take up to 15 hours to complete a single chair to ensure consistency and durability of craftsmanship. We also upgraded to Sunbrella fabrics, which are much more resilient and resistant to water and fading. Plus each set comes with a cover that would easily retail for hundreds of dollars alone. The quality rivals an upscale home furnishing store, where similar sets would retail for about $10,000 or more. At Sam's Club, our members pay less than $2,000. We've also made significant improvements in fresh, which is a key driver for repeat traffic across the club. People are surprised to learn that you can find prime Angus beef and fresh Alaskan salmon in our clubs. This year, we expanded prime Angus beef to all clubs, and we're now one of the top retailers in the prime category. And we've been deepening our relationship with our suppliers to find unique items that can't be found anywhere else. Our Grape Soda Grape is a great example. Before I tell you about the product, I want to share a little bit about the buyer. Phil Macy is one of our senior merchants, and he's been with Sam's Club for 27 years, always in our fresh business. For the last several years, he's been focused on buying grapes and stone fruits. Phil is truly an expert in his field, and he travels to Spain, Chile, Israel, as well as working domestically through nurseries to identify the next best thing for our members. And you know what, this is no quick process. It can take up to 12 years to develop a new variety and a lot of taste testing. Phil estimates that he probably tastes about 500 grapes a year. That's a lot of grapes. Phil was behind the creation of the Cotton Candy Grape in 2017, and he worked with the same nursery in California to perfect the taste and texture of the Grape Soda variety. Sam's Club has a trademark on the name and exclusivity with the grower. We sold the Grape Soda Grapes in select clubs last summer for 2 weeks, and we're planning to expand to more clubs this year. So while we're becoming known for the quirky and unexpected, our members are also talking about the quality, too. Our fresh Net Promoter Score has improved every quarter this year, with a 230 basis point increase overall. Now let's turn our focus to digital. Technology gives us the opportunity to empower our associates and our members. It simplifies work for the associate and removes friction for members and enhances the overall experience of membership. You probably -- I hope you're familiar with Scan & Go. I believe it is one of the most delightful experiences we offer our members at Sam's Club. It's a great example of how we value members' time and put control in their hands. Think of a typical shopping experience. As a member moves through the club, he's mentally purchasing each item he puts into the cart. In fact, he probably feels like they're already his own. But then we ask him to stand in line to ring up those items. Scan & Go flips the scenario. It removes the friction and empowers our members to own their shopping experience from beginning to end. With Scan & Go, members can scan an item's barcode with their phones as they shop and then skip the checkout line and pay through the app. And members value the experience. We're seeing a repeat usage rate of about 85%. We're going to continue to innovate with Scan & Go, and you're going to learn a little bit more about that during the tech panel. New implementations of technology are great for associates, too. You'll hear more later during the tech panel about Ask Sam, but I want to talk to you now about Sam's Garage. You heard Doug mention Sam's Garage before, but I want to talk about how it's driving sales. So Sam's Garage is a new application that's driving our tire and battery business. Associates who work in tire and battery centers in the past had to navigate bulky product books, a mess of paperwork and 5 systems to simply sell products and schedule installation for members. Sam's Garage streamlined all of that into 1 single app. An average transaction time has dropped from about 20 minutes to less than 5 minutes, and it's improving sales. So when we combined the convenience of Sam's Garage with disruptive pricing during a recent 1-day event, we saw a 55% increase in transactions. Sam's Club continues to focus on emerging tech and pilot new ways to simplify the business. We're testing the use of computer vision to curb out of stocks and exit technology that can help reduce theft. We even have drones flying around in some of our clubs to help better manage inventory, especially items housed up high in the steel. And at Sam's Club now in Dallas, we're testing an enhancement to Scan & Go called Item Vision. Members can point their camera at a product to add it to their digital shopping cart. No searching for bar codes. The image of the item is all a member needs to make the shopping experience even faster than ever. So these innovations aren't in all clubs yet. But we think all of them have the potential to impact Sam's Club and enhance the overall experience for members and associates. Shopping with Sam's Club should be seamless, and we have to be relentless about removing friction and providing an omnichannel experience. We give our members choice and convenience no matter how they want to shop with us, options like Scan & Go, same-day club pickup, grocery delivery and direct-to-home shipping. And remember, direct-to-home shipping is offered free with our Plus membership with no minimums for most items. Part of our membership story is a huge growth we're seeing online. Our members love SamsClub.com. Online sales at Sam's grew by 32% last year, which includes both club pickup and direct-to-home sales. We've successfully converted several former clubs to fulfillment centers to make our direct-to-home offering faster and more effective while also reducing the cost to ship. We're also -- we've also recently started testing ship from club for eCommerce orders. This test is in about 22 clubs, and we're really happy with the early results. We're adding membership value through our website, too, with features like travel and entertainment and home improvement services that have saved our members millions since launching earlier this year. And we've just added this Personalized Perks portal, so members can see their individualized savings piling up. Our focus on the target member and the value of the Sam's Club membership is working. We're seeing growth in total member counts and renewal rates. Plus Member penetration rates continue to see positive results, hitting an all-time high during FY '20 and improving 170 basis points over the last year. We expect more positive membership trends as we continue to improve the in-club and online experience for our members while enhancing the value of their membership. I want to wrap up by highlighting a few key things I hope you all took away from today. First, the changes we've made to simplify the business have made us stronger. Our total member count, renewal rates and Plus Member penetration rates are growing. And our traffic numbers and comp sales, excluding fuel and tobacco, remained healthy. Secondly, we're an item business, and we will continue to focus on bringing innovative products at amazing quality and value to our clubs. Thirdly, Sam's Club remains an innovation hub, driven by associates and technology. We're developing tools to make shopping and working at Sam's easier and more delightful than ever. And finally, the focus on the target member is working, and we will continue to push toward a more omnichannel experience that empowers our member. Today, Sam's Club is a great business, and we're tremendously pleased with the progress we've made. But I know we're even more excited about where we're headed and the opportunities we see in the future. We tell our members to expect something special, and that's a promise I know we can keep. Thank you. Daniel Binder : Great. Thank you, Kath. So we'll have a 15-minute break as we transition to our innovation panel, and then that will be followed by our Q&A session. So thanks. [Break] Daniel Binder : So as I mentioned earlier, we have an innovation panel that we're introducing to the program this year. And we'll kick it off with Doug and Suresh, and I'll let you take the lead on. Doug McMillon : Yes. We're going to take a few minutes and try to give you some examples of innovation that's happening, that are happening across the company. And we'll try to do that with some speed, and maybe we'll talk a little bit about how it's happening as well. And I mentioned earlier that we've been innovating and operating on top of a legacy tech stack that, as you would imagine through our acquisitions, as we grown internationally and built a business, historically ends up being a series of systems, and it needs to be simplified and modernized. As we do that, we'll find our way towards more speed, more innovation and more productivity. And Suresh Kumar, who I briefly introduced earlier, joined us in July, came from Google. He's a type of leader who can lead that type of investment and lead it well. And we're really excited to have you. Suresh, if you would start off kind of with -- kind of a big picture question, and let's talk a little bit about what it means to modernize the technology that we have at Walmart today. Suresh Kumar : Absolutely. So a few pieces, having the right talent, creating the right structures and then creating the right architecture that will allow us to incorporate new technologies within this vision, voice. These are the things that will allow us to develop innovative solutions on behalf of our customers or for our associates. Now we have great engineers. We have great data scientists and our technologists. We are creating structures to make them even more effective so that they can drive leverage and reuse. We are creating deeper expertise in areas like machine learning and the cloud. And in terms of architecture, the cloud is in the center of everything that we are doing. But we are not just taking at all legacy complex applications and simply just moving them to the cloud, we are rebuilding them so that they can take advantage of what the cloud really has to offer. So for example in the store associates, while building applications to be cloud native, we can incorporate things like wise assistants into them, and this is something that the legacy architecture would never allow us to be able to do. And so these are some of the ways in which we can go faster and be a lot more innovative. Doug McMillon : I'm excited about the plan, and I'm excited about doing it faster. Let's go deeper into the architecture and talk a bit more about what a hybrid cloud actually means, what it means at Walmart. Suresh Kumar : Absolutely. So we have built out a large and sophisticated cloud on which we are building all the modern stack and the modern applications. So we have got a private cloud that we have installed inside our data centers. We are partnering with public cloud providers, and we are building out edge computing in our stores. So this combination is a hybrid cloud architecture that is uniquely suited for what we want. So we can take workloads, and we can move them seamlessly from the private cloud to public cloud to make use of the flex capacity when we need it. This is something that we did very effectively last holiday season. We can make use of the specialized compute capabilities that the public cloud offers so that we can run our complex workloads over this training machine, learning models, big data. These things run very effectively on the public cloud. And then finally, we can take our applications and use the edge that we are building out to move them closer to where our associates and our customers are inside the store, so that we can improve the customer experience. So it is these 3 pieces that are coming together that form the underpinning of the modern stack that we are building out. Doug McMillon : I hope this is starting to connect some dots for you. We want to get faster. We want to get more innovative. We know we can use technology to be more productive. And in today's accounting world, a lot of the tech that we build is more on the OpEx side than the CapEx side. So we mentioned earlier in our guidance, we've got this increased investment in technology that in a period of years, we can position ourselves to be even stronger and better. It's one of the governors that we can use as we manage earnings, how fast do we go? Does this happen in 2 years, 3 years, 4 years? It's not a lot more than that, but it's also not in a year. So it's one of the variables that you might keep in mind as you think about the guidance that we gave you earlier. So now imagine the tech stack has been modernized, and all these emerging technologies are now available to us to serve customers in different ways. And you hear about all these various things. Marc mentioned some of them earlier today. Which ones do you think are most relevant and practical to move the needle for Walmart? Suresh Kumar : Absolutely. So we are already incorporating a lot of the many emerging technologies and new technologies, whether it is IoT, Internet of Things, blockchain, voice, vision, robotics and so on. But the one technology that I'm particularly excited about because it has relevance in pretty much every single thing that we do, and that's machine learning or ML. So with ML, we can improve our customer experience, we can make our associates' lives a lot easier, and we can reduce costs by driving more efficiency. So let me give you one example. This is a project that we call Smart Substitutions. So imagine that you are an associate, and you're picking items on behalf of our customers inside the store. And as you are picking items, you'll find that one of the items that the customer wants just went out of stock. That happens occasionally. So at this time, you want to go find an alternate product, a substitute, if you would, to offer to our customers so that they don't get disappointed. This used to be very error-prone, manual, it was a very difficult task. In fact, our associates used to have a piece of printed paper with a bunch of rules written on them so that they could go find out what are the best substitute for that particular product. Well, this is where we leverage ML to come and help. We trained the model. That extracted information from -- about the products that we sell, input relationships between them, combine that with customer preferences. Now the result is that we automatically figure out the best substitute, and we direct our associates to go pick that. Associates are very happy. They don't need to stop what they're doing and go on trying to hunt for the product. But equally important, our customers are very happy because the product that the machine learning algorithm picks up is unique, personalized for what the customer wants in that particular instance. And so this is the power of ML that we want to leverage everywhere in what we do. Doug McMillon : We have a lot of focus on the accuracy of first-time pick rate. But when we have to do a substitution, it needs to be as seamless as possible. So we'll try to eliminate them. And then the ones that we have, we'll make better. Let's wrap up with data. Walmart's used information for a long time to help us within stock replenishment. Our suppliers have been very helpful in helping us manage information that we've had, but we've never really focused on customer data to the maximum of our capability. And there are other places where we can monetize and use data more effectively, personalize the experience for customers, et cetera. How do you view the opportunity in front of us as it relates to data? Suresh Kumar : Absolutely. So Walmart is unique. Like you said, we have over 216 million people walking into our stores every week around the world. That gives us a huge set of information from which we can draw insights to help serve our customers even better. And that's something that we want to do, that we are committed to doing. But we want to do that in a way that is extremely mindful of the trust that they place in us. I talked about personalization. I talked about machine learning. Let me give you another example, which is online grocery pickup. This is something that our customers love to -- love as a feature because they can book a slot, drive up, and we have the product loaded into their vehicle. But nobody wants to wait for too long. They don't want to wait for the slot, and they don't want to wait inside their cars. So this is where data helps, right? So we looked at the data around how the slots are getting booked. And we started predicting which slots are going to get filled up soon, put that in front of the customer so that they could select which slots that would work best for them. Similarly, we started looking at not just customer information, but we also started getting data around how our stores are actually functioning, what the parking lot looks like. And we combine that with information and data surrounding the stores, traffic patterns, construction and so on. The result is that we can predict very, very accurately when a particular customer is actually going to show up for their pickup order, meaning that now we can serve them just in time. Times go down, customers are happy, but it also ends up creating a flywheel effect, where the better we serve our customers, the more deeply engaged they are with us, and that gives us more opportunities to serve them even better. Doug McMillon : Got it. Suresh, really excited about your leadership. Glad you're here at Walmart. We're not going to wait to keep driving innovation until all of this work is done. These things will be happening in parallel, and we're going to give you some more examples of what's already underway. Suresh, thanks for coming out. Suresh Kumar : Thank you. Doug McMillon : I now want to ask Dacona Smith and Jamie Iannone to come up for a few minutes. Welcome, Dacona. Jamie, we'll start with you. Jamie Iannone : Yes. Doug McMillon : Jamie leads membership, marketing, SamsClub.com at Sam's. He drives the product mindset. He works closely with the technology team. He's been with us for 6 years now? Jamie Iannone : Yes, 6 years. Doug McMillon : And before that was with Barnes & Noble leading digital products and then at eBay for 7 years leading search and some other areas there before making his way to join us, which we're really glad that you did. Lots of cool stuff happening at Sam's. I mean for us to be able to stand up today and say that Sam's Club has become a tech incubator is really cool. Jamie Iannone : It's exciting. Doug McMillon : Yes. So thank you for your leadership as it relates to making that happen. Kath talked about Scan & Go. Let's lean into kind of the product itself, what the future looks like for it first, if you would. Jamie Iannone : Yes. Scan & Go really started from 2 associates, entrepreneurs really, who said, \"What if we could take one of the pain points or friction points in shopping, the checkout lines, and avoid it all together by giving people the point of sale right on the mobile phone they're already carrying?\" So they worked on this in late 2016, launched it, and members fell in love with the product. Instantly a hit, very highly rated, high repeat rate, so we rolled it out to the whole fleet pretty quickly. And since then, nothing but really good feedback from our members about using Scan & Go. We want to continue to innovate and push the envelope. So one of our big requests was, we'd like to be able to purchase adult beverages with Scan & Go as well. So we added that over the course of this year. Doug McMillon : Did that idea come up at about 5 p.m. on a -- one day? Or... Jamie Iannone : All the time. Sundays before football. So that's been a big success. And then they also wanted to integrate it into the core experience. So we integrated it into one app, the Sam's Club app. If you went to the iOS store today, it's 4.9 stars. Members just have the best things to say about it. So they continue to push the envelope on innovation. What they're working on now is how do we eliminate the need to even scan the actual barcode. So we've talked about Sam's Club Now, which is our Tech Innovation Club in Dallas. And there, we're doing a test where you just point the camera at the item, and it recognize it. So you just hold it over the avocados, and it says... Doug McMillon : You don't have to scan a barcode or anything? Jamie Iannone : No. And it says, \"Would you like to add the avocados?\" They go right to the bag. And people look at that and they think, wow, that's like magic. That's really cool. And that's what our product and tech teams kind of live for, is for a customer to say, \"Wow, that was like magic.\" That's a home run. Doug McMillon : Love that. We've talked a lot about Ask Sam today, but I'd appreciate if you'd go deeper into how that product was built. And when we -- we get excited because we think about all these footsteps. Associates all over our clubs and stores running all over the place to get information and how efficient it is. It's been fun to see how Ask Sam has taken hold at Sam's. How did that story come about? How do you build something like that? Jamie Iannone : Yes, it was interesting. Dacona and John always talked about how do we make sure that our associates can be on the floor, helping our members all the time. We never want them to have to go get data in the backroom, et cetera. And how do we make it really easy? So if you come to work at Sam's Club, it's very intuitive how to work there. So we thought, well, if we could just take a voice assistant and have you talked to the phone and let it answer common questions like, how do I cut a ribeye steak or how many Plus Members have we signed up today, that would make it really easy. So that's what we did. Take a look at this video of our associates using Ask Sam's. [Presentation] Jamie Iannone : Yes. So we're excited about this. We often talk about small empowered teams, so engineers, product managers and designers designing a great product. This was 11 engineers over 5 months that built this product. And what's great is it's a self-learning product. So we tell our associates, the more questions you ask it, the smarter it's going to get. So they started asking it questions like, can you print the sign for broccoli? And it didn't have that capability yet, but it quickly learned how to do it, and we included it. And now they're using it for things like printing signs when they're out there on the floor. So it's really... Doug McMillon : Maybe we can ask it how to forecast sales in December. We apparently can work on that. Can it tell you anything? Jamie Iannone : Yes. Suresh talked about AI and machine learning, so put it all in there. Doug McMillon : Kath and I were in a Sam's Club in Florida a few weeks ago, and there was this one section that looked like it had too many SKUs for a warehouse club, and so we were wondering if the club had it set wrong. And we asked the club manager, can you show us the layout for this particular section? He pulled his phone out, asked the Sam's Club app, and it pulls up the exact layout. And sure enough, he's got it set just right. It was our problem, not his problem, and he was very pleased to point that out to us after I got through showing it to him. Thanks, Jamie. So you worked at Walmart for a long time. How many years with the company, Dacona? Dacona Smith : Almost 30. Doug McMillon : 30. And what was your first job? Dacona Smith : Cart pusher. Doug McMillon : You've come a long way. Dacona Smith : Assembling bikes and cart pusher. Doug McMillon : And now when you show up at a store to go visit, what's the first thing you do? Probably grab a shopping cart and push it inside? Dacona Smith : That's exactly right. Doug McMillon : Haven't come that far. So you leave Walmart, you go to Sam's Club. And you spend about a year over there, and you see how the team is working as it relates to products like this. And now you move back over to Walmart U.S. to run all of operations. Congratulations. Dacona Smith : Thank you. Doug McMillon : Are you going to steal the Ask Sam? Dacona Smith : We're already doing it. Jamie don't know I'm meeting with his team regularly, moving all of his tech over to Walmart. No, but Ask Sam is just a good example of many tech products that Jamie delivered to the clubs at Sam's. Ask Sam puts all of that technology right in the associate's hand. So you can only imagine all the modules that we set, all the planograms, asking for prices, locations, all of that now can be done by voice. So thank you, Jamie. You helped the whole company, Jamie. Quite a deal. Jamie Iannone : I love it. Love to see the impact. Doug McMillon : I mentioned Spark earlier, the independent contractor platform. Would you tell everybody a little bit more about it? What's the future look like for Spark? Dacona Smith : Yes. Spark is our in-house delivery platform. And basically, what -- it uses crowd-sourced drivers. Basically, what you do is you go to drive4spark.com. You can sign up to make deliveries. You have to pass a few checks, of course. So you have to pass a couple of checks, then you can download the app, and the app would tell you everything you need to do to complete a successful delivery. So if you're in, I don't know, New Orleans, or Nashville, on vacation, and you need to make a little extra money, we can help you out. You can go to drive4spark.com, and we can put you to work. But it is -- give us a lot of flexibility. It's going to give us some flexibility to understand the end-to-end use of delivery, more options to serve our customers. And as you know, Doug, over the last couple of years, we've been expanding. We've launched and really scaled our same-day grocery delivery, and we've used last mile delivery partners to help us with that. So if you think about Spark, it can help us provide flexibility and some learning. So that's -- it'll be really positive. Doug McMillon : Just one of the ways we'll solve last mile as we're working on autonomous vehicles, we're working with partners. In the case of InHome, we wanted to be our own associates. There's a menu of ways for us to solve last mile for customers, and we're working on that. Thank you both very much. Dacona Smith : Thank you, Doug. Jamie Iannone : Thanks, Doug. Doug McMillon : I appreciate you coming up. I'll invite a couple of more folks to come up. Karthik Raghupathy leads Strategic Development and Business Development for PhonePe, Karthik, and Kathleen McLaughlin is our Chief Sustainability Officer. Karthik, I'll start with you. We've covered PhonePe to some extent, but you've been there from the beginning, and you understand this better than anybody else. In your own words, how would you describe PhonePe to this group? Karthik Raghupathy;VP of Strategy and Business Development for PhonePe : Sure. So Doug, we are a technology company, and we're on a mission to unlock the flow of money and access to services. So in Hindi, PhonePe quite literally means on the phone, and we use the English connotation of the word pe to create that connection with everything to do with money on the phone. Doug McMillon : Got it. So there's a use case that starts with payment in India, and then it expands from there. And now we've all seen what happened with WeChat and how Tencent led that. These use cases, as they grow, do they result in what some people call a super app? Karthik Raghupathy;VP of Strategy and Business Development for PhonePe : Yes, let me start answering that question with a short video. Doug McMillon : Okay. Anticipated that one. [Presentation] Karthik Raghupathy;VP of Strategy and Business Development for PhonePe : So the short answer to your question, Doug, is, yes, but in a much more broad and powerful sense than the traditional notion of a super app.  So at PhonePe, we are driven by technology to offer everyone an equal opportunity to access money and services. And specifically, we think this manifests in 3 dimensions of what we would call a super app : consumers, merchants and banks. So firstly, on the consumer side, we believe in enabling equal access, regardless of location or socioeconomic status. And we take great pride in the fact that more than 65% of our nearly 200 million users are from small towns and villages all over India. I think this is a testament to the power of technology to really democratize access. So secondly, on the merchant side, we work with about 10 million merchants, the majority of whom are small and medium enterprises. And we're actively working on driving their growth by connecting them to our consumer network. So for example, as Judith mentioned earlier, we recently launched the PhonePe ATM, which is a revolutionary first in market innovation that has totally transformed the ATM landscape in India. It simultaneously solves for a consumer pain point to have access to ATMs while also driving more footfall to our merchant partners and thereby drive their growth. And then thirdly, on the banking side, when you connect consumers and merchants together, money lies at the heart of this intersection, and all our use cases are aimed at unlocking the flow of money. So PhonePe's users can use us to transfer money to each other, to pay their bills, to spend money both at online and off-line merchants and manage and grow their money using financial products like gold, insurance and mutual funds. So yes, we are a super app. Doug McMillon : Got it. So some people might be a little confused about the ATM reference. Actually, what's happening is India's generation is skipping ATMS. Karthik Raghupathy;VP of Strategy and Business Development for PhonePe : That's right. Doug McMillon : It's digital money dispersed frequently at kiranas. Karthik Raghupathy;VP of Strategy and Business Development for PhonePe : That's right. Doug McMillon : That's another example of how innovation is occurring in India and innovations occurring within Walmart. We're really excited about PhonePe. That's why we've talked about it so much today, but we're just as excited about Flipkart and Myntra. And the way this -- as I've mentioned to you in our last meeting, the way these pieces fit together to create a mutually reinforcing ecosystem is super interesting to us. Business models are changing. The retail business model has changed and is changing, and we're learning a lot due from what's happening in India and applying that across the company in an increasing way. And really appreciate you and the team. Please thank everybody for us. It might surprise you to know that in my job, sometimes things get announced at Walmart that I've never heard of until I've read about them in the news. But I know that's not supposed to be the case. I'm supposed to hear about everything internally. But actually, today, there is so much happening across the company that it's true that we're solving problems and innovating in ways that I haven't heard about sometimes until I read about it. And I actually love that. Now I try to be careful not to ask too many questions when that's the case because it will slow people down, and they'll want to clear everything with leadership, and we don't want them to do that. We have common values. We have a culture. You know what problems you need to go solve and go solve the problems. That's an important ingredient as it relates to speed. So when we were talking about telling you some innovation stories and tech stories, it was exciting for me to hear Kathleen McLaughlin, her story and what her team has been doing, to take technology and put it to work to tackle some of the biggest problems we face as humans. Kathleen is a global shaper as it relates to thought leadership and policy, and we're really thankful that she's part of Walmart helping us all become Chief Sustainability Officers. And if you would, Kathleen, tell them about how we're deploying tech to help with things like climate change. Kathleen McLaughlin : Yes. Well, climate is one of the biggest issues that we face in the whole environmental and social landscape. And what we're trying to do at Walmart is take issues that are relevant for our business, for our customers, our associates, communities and address them through our business assets in a way that not only helps the world move quicker to transform to address these issues, but it's also good for business. And climate is a great example. We've been working, Doug, as you well know, since 2005 in earnest on our own emissions from operations. We've doubled fleet efficiency. We're on our way to 50% renewable energy, powering all of our stores. We're working on energy efficiency, on refrigerants, all of these things. But of course, for a retailer and in the consumer goods industry in general, 90% of the emissions are not in retail operations. They're in the supply chain, and it's things like agriculture, waste, food waste, packaging waste, the design of consumer products themselves, deforestation, things like this. So a couple of years back, we set a science-based target for emissions reduction. We were, I think, the first retailer to do so. And we said, \"Okay, scope 1, scope 2, we've got it. The question is, how do we tackle all of those emissions in the supply chain?\" So we launched an effort called Project Gigaton, which is powered by a digital platform to help our suppliers engage and work with us to accelerate emissions reduction all across supply chains, and there's 3 things that are pretty exciting about it. One is it's science-based, but it's very practical. So we worked with World Wildlife Fund, with Environmental Defense Fund to develop a bunch of super practical interventions that suppliers can take in supply chains and translate them through calculators into emissions reduction. So it's very easy for people to engage in this and get started and start working on emissions reduction. Second thing is because of that, it democratizes access. Karthik, you talked about this. We -- that's a theme that runs throughout Walmart. We want to democratize access to things, and this is no different. We now have 2,300 suppliers working on this, signed up working on initiatives to reduce emissions. And I think you mentioned this earlier, Doug. We're over 200 million metric tons of emissions avoided. It's actually north of  250 million at this point just a couple of years in. So that's great. Well on our way to that Gigaton target. And the third thing is the way we set it up with the platform and incentives and help for suppliers, it's a bit of an escalator in terms of ambition and impact, right? So people can come in. It's very easy to get started, but then we ratchet them up in terms of their own ambition and what they're able to achieve. So we've got incentives for what we call Giga-Gurus. These are of the 2,300 suppliers, the hundreds that have SMART goals, that have reported results and so on. And we're excited about that because it allows us to keep the standards high of what does it really mean to be making progress on this but have a broad charge to get people in and move them up that escalator toward that goal. We just received an A from CDP on climate action, which we're really proud about. I think it makes us 1 of, I don't know, 30 companies out of 8,000 that submitted to CDP to get that score. So I'd just say watch this space. We're going to continue to innovate here and with our whole ESG agenda to try to drive impact in a way that really does create value as well for business. Doug McMillon : I mentioned earlier this idea of business serving multi-stakeholders. I think you gave us several good examples of how reaching out to suppliers or thinking about the planet or communities is actually really good business because eliminating waste helps us fulfill our purpose of saving people money so they can live better. And sometimes that waste takes the form of carbon. Sometimes it's plastics. And we're trying to work across the whole system, be systems thinkers and drive an overall optimization of our business model, not a suboptimization. And I hope through these examples, you can see that culturally, we've -- we're there, our mindset's there, and we're doing good work, and we know that we can do more. And Kathleen, appreciate your leadership in making that happen. Kathleen McLaughlin : Well, thanks. Likewise. Doug McMillon : Thank you very much. Karthik, thank you. Karthik Raghupathy;VP of Strategy and Business Development for PhonePe : Thank you, Doug. Doug McMillon : We're going to pivot now to the Q&A portion, and I'm going to invite the team to come up and join me up here. And Dan will help facilitate, and we'll open it up for any question on any subject that you all want to ask. And Paul's hand went up first. Daniel Binder : Yes. Doug McMillon : Dan? Daniel Binder : I saw that. Doug McMillon : He's early. Daniel Binder : I saw that. He's not wasted any time. Again, if you could just state your name and firm, I mean, that would be appreciated for the webcast. Paul Trussell : Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. I wanted to maybe first focus on the U.S. operation. One of the keys to success is the collaboration between John and Marc's team. Maybe let's just dig into that a little bit and speak about that collaboration and maybe even that friction as we think about balancing growth and begin a more profitable company. And as a part of that conversation, maybe just bucket for us, what are the omnichannel initiatives really enabling this year's guidance? And then if we were to think about, if you were actually providing a longer framework, what are those items from an omnichannel standpoint that aren't yet at scale today but will absolutely be a factor over the coming 2 to 3 years? Doug McMillon : We probably all want to weigh in on that one. John, why don't you go first? Marc, you go -- and then I'll -- others can jump in. John Furner : Yes. Paul, thanks for the question. First, I think it's important that between Marc and I, there's a lot of collaboration. We spend a lot of time working together, thinking about how we serve customers, whether it's in-store or pickup, channels. And really, the lines are pretty blurry between e-commerce stores and how we think about omni. And what I'm most excited about and energized by is, is thinking about putting the customer at the center and then building everything in our ecosystem around the needs of the customer. And then between all of our businesses and the tools that we've got available, being able to serve the customer any way they want to be served, whether it's at home, direct to home, the refrigerator, other services like health and wellness. So thinking about it, for us, as we look forward, it's all about the customer, finding ways that we can create new ways for growth, and then layer on top of it innovation that works across all the channels. But I'm really excited about the work we've been doing. Marc Lore : Yes, I know. As John said, the lines are blurred. We think about the business as one U.S. business. And like John said, there's one customer at the center. We've been on a journey now the last couple of years. We brought in a Chief Customer Officer, Janey, and brought the customer org together. We recently brought together the supply chain under Greg Smith.  So the orgs are starting to come together, and I think it's working well. Both the Chief Customer Officer and Greg went in supply chain has really helped us create a real 2 end-to-end omni experience. And I think merchandise is the next area that we're focused on and looking at right now, even still underneath the people running both areas of eCom and stores like the GMs of those businesses are working very closely together, more so than ever before, I think. Doug McMillon : In the late '90s, I was the General Merchandise Manager for electronics, books, sporting goods, stationery and some other categories and could see what was happening with eCommerce, with e-Toys, and Amazon starting to sell books and those kinds of changes. And going way back then, we were even thinking about spinning out Walmart.com and having it be a separate entity separate from Walmart to create speed and the investment. From the late '90s all the way through until kind of these last few years, I've seen the fits and starts with Walmart, trying to get really committed to eCommerce and make it happen. And we'd love to do some of that over again if we could do it over again and kept some separation between stores and eCommerce because I had seen a large profitable established business in large and small ways diminish the emerging investment business, if I could call it that. And Clay Christensen's book, The Innovator's Dilemma, influenced me a lot. And having had conversations with him and read the book and studied it, I concluded we got to keep this separate for a little while. But the issue is the customer keeps pulling it together. They want one experience for the brand. And so what we've got to have is we got to have a leadership team that gets omni and believes in omni and supports the whole thing. People that work in eCommerce that want to help stores. People that work in stores that want to help eCommerce. And over time, this ends up being one business and one thing. So Marc mentioned the customer org and the supply chain org. There'll be other changes that come along, but we've got to set ourselves up so that the whole thing can innovate and move with speed in an omni fashion. And I really do appreciate how everybody has worked together these last few years, but there's a whole other gear to get to, to make this happen in a faster way. And I think it's time to really this next year and maybe a little bit beyond kind of finish that off and have one omni org still with a great diverse team, thinking about how we solve these problems. But in the end, one customer proposition that's seamless. And you asked about what does that unlock looking ahead, and just think about how easy we can make it to do merchandise returns when somebody wants to do a merchandise return. Now think about how we can connect that payment. Think about how we can use data when we have one version of the customer. We know who they are, and we know what they've consumed across the channels. There are lots of little unlocks that'll occur as we get even better at that. And I'm really excited about it. Kathryn McLay : On that, too, I think even across formats, as I'm thinking about my member base, what are the things that John is doing really well with Marc that we can then import across to Sam's. So if you think about even when you're doing with spot delivery, I mean, that is great as we're leading into ship from Club. So I think as you think about your format, what are those things that are working in other formats from an omni perspective that you can just steal and go fast with. Daniel Binder : Next to Ed on the far side. Edward Yruma : This is Ed Yruma, Keybanc Capital Markets. Quick question for you guys. You seem like you're starting to test and lean more into services in the superstore. I know you've always had some service component, restaurants or things like that. What's different this time? And what filters are you looking for in order to determine whether you do a broader rollout? John Furner : I think the first one that I would speak about is -- are the initiatives in health care, and it really all goes back to what customers need and our ability to serve customers in, call it, 5,000 communities all around for just a second gives us an interesting ability to be able to help a lot of customers with the things that they need. Another area when they're in the store, and they need to -- or on the website, and they want to finance an item they're buying, we can help with that, whether it's us or a partner or some combination thereof. But there are a number of ways that customers need to be able to close all their transactions, and I'm excited about both those opportunities. As Doug said, we've got a big base. We've got a lot of data. There are things we can do to make people's lives easier on their behalf, and Walmart is well suited to do that. Daniel Binder : We'll go over here to Bob Drbul. Robert Drbul : Just a question on the -- It's Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. A question on the Walmart apparel offering, some of the learnings from December. But as you think about the mix of business, opening price points versus brands, I'd be curious to hear from both you guys if you could talk about the importance of branded apparel in the mix and like what you're doing online with branded apparel being able to maybe move some of it into the stores and sort of how you're working together on making the apparel business better. John Furner : Yes. Traditionally, the way that the merchants would think about apparel is, and I mentioned this earlier, is, call it, the fashion pyramid. We've got basics, fashion basics, and then you got fashion at the top of it. And in store assortment, in the last year or so, has been focused at the lower end of that even at points where we need to expand up. But having an aligned team between the [ Nice and the Vienna and Bentonville ], working together, we can use the website for different things that we can use the stores for, and they'll complement each other. And I think it's important to just think of that thread that goes from the fashion business into the basics, and then there are different items that we can share across and others that you may be able to do online that we don't do in the store down the line. Marc Lore : Yes. For example, Scoop is a great example and Sofia Vergara. Both those brands were online first and now in stores, and we see that trend continuing. There are opportunities for branded assortment that we create that's proprietary going across dot-com in stores. John Furner : I think both home and apparel are examples of the 2 teams working closely together, and then they can extend assortments in ways that they couldn't on their own. And we're talking about apparel. But home, in particular, has had a lot of success early. And Anthony and Jeff, the 2 people that lead the business, have done a really nice job pairing up what's in the stores, the core and then they complement it on the site with the long tail, and customers are responding really well. Daniel Binder : And we'll go to Chris next and then Michael Lasser after that. Christopher Horvers : Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. Can you talk about the fulfilled by Walmart vision a little bit more? How much of this is the tails of the assortment versus, say, that first 1 million SKUs that you've talked about that drive 80% of all the transactions? Is this sort of a recognition that you're not getting the coverage as fast as you want or maybe you're not getting the access to the brand as quickly as you want? And then just broadly, what's the puts and takes of 1P versus 3P? Marc Lore : Yes. So Walmart fulfillment services is a critical part of our strategy. You mentioned it, it's definitely brought in an assortment. So there are merchants on third-party that we want to have that simply don't have fulfillment capabilities, and so we're not able to get that assortment on the website. So that's really the first priority, is to really focus on those brands and getting assortment for customers. Also, just having the stuff in our warehouse allows us to offer a better customer experience. It allows us to co-mingle the product in the same box when we ship it out with first party, which helps the economics. So there's lots of reasons to like the business. We're feeling good about the start. We've built the technology. We've got a handful of sellers using it. They like it. We're seeing good results. But it's something that we're going take slowly, make sure it's right before we really blow it out. Christopher Horvers : Just as a follow-up, it seemed like initially, it was, well, if we get coverage up to that 1 million SKUs, we don't necessarily have to go beyond. So I guess what I'm trying to understand is, what's changed now that you're doing it? Was it more of like, okay, we're good at this now and we're moving to the next level? Or was there something that you felt like the strategy wasn't addressing? Marc Lore : Yes. No, it was always point of the strategy. It's just a matter of getting to it. The top million SKUs is definitely an area of focus to get those in our warehouse because it does represent a large percentage of sales. But the goal is still to carry everything. So we definitely want to carry everything that a customer might want when they come to Walmart.com. Doug McMillon : And we may have failed to communicate clearly at times, including me, about the 1 million or 2 million being first party versus everything. I mean, we never thought 1P plus 3P was 1 million or 2 SKUs. We were focused on 1P as we were answering those questions. So it'll be a much bigger assortment when you put 3P with it. Michael Lasser : Michael Lasser, UBS. The market perception is that Walmart's been on -- especially in the U.S., Walmart has been on this journey over the last few years where there's been an investment in price, there's been an investment in people. And now, the company is starting to harvest those returns. And at the same time, its eCommerce profitability is stabilizing, such that the totality of the U.S. business, the margin there is stable and can continue to be stable from here. A, is that a reasonable expectation? And B, what are the 2 or 3 factors that might have to -- that might arise to motivate the company to say, hey, we have to make further sizable investments and bring down our profitability from here? And then totally unrelated to that before Keri takes away the microphone, have you won the war against the hard discounters? Or could the battle reemerge such that those price gaps are going to shrink, and you'll have to, as all the elite, will just get bigger and have more stores and your -- more competition that we're going to see flare-ups of that over time? Brett Biggs : Maybe, Michael, I'll kick off. So if you look at the -- kind of the profitability of what you saw last year and particularly the U.S. business, and you see the guidance we've given this year, pretty similar. And so I think we feel good about this. John can tag on a little bit. We feel good about that kind of algorithm, so to speak, for the Walmart U.S. business. We're always going to invest in the business first. And if we see opportunities for things that we think give us a long-term benefit, I think Doug said it this morning, but it might have some short-term pressure. We're going to be upfront with you about that. What we're saying today with the guidance is we think we've invested in the things that we feel like we should to make sure we're there for the customer now and in the future. But the customer is going to continue to change. Competition will continue to change, and we've got to make sure that we have the ability to evolve with that. Doug McMillon : There's a reason we only give annual guidance. It is a fluid environment, and we're making decisions all the time. And when I look ahead and think about what more we would want to do, it'd be things that would help us secure the future of the company. So if we see a window to play offense on something, and we think speed is really important, we'd be more aggressive in that way. We would like to pay our people more, and we have been and will continue to be focused on people. That'll be important. But we have put a lot of this on the board. Now we've got a lot to work with, a lot of variables to make decisions around. And so I think we described it earlier in today or -- and just now sufficiently. John Furner : Yes, I think the sales number, as Brett said earlier, that's about $9 billion of growth, which is a great number for the total business. And inside the box and online, we'll always be watching what competitors do. And I wouldn't underestimate any competitor any time. We're constantly scanning and looking and making sure that whatever we've got out to offer is what a customer wants and it makes sense in terms of value. So we'll always be looking, and we'll decide as we go. Doug McMillon : As it relates to like card discount, we don't underestimate them or anybody. Our opening price points are going to have the right spec and the right size and priced competitively. And then we have this whole other assortment that we can work with to make sure that we deliver profitability for the business. Judith McKenna : And Mike, just to add on, having competed with hard discounters pretty much my whole retail life, one of the differences for the U.S. is that the price position is much stronger already, and it gives you the ability to compete on everything else. That's not necessarily true in every market around the world where the price gap is much wider. So you are already starting from a better position here than I think you would see in other markets. Daniel Binder : We'll go to the center right here. Caroline Conway : Caroline Conway from AllianceBernstein. I just wanted to ask you about the supply chain support for the omnichannel efforts in the stores. It sounds very clear that the supercenters are going to be the hub for pickup, of course, and then home delivery. Just curious if there are also investments that you're considering for things like each of us picking up the DCs or dark stores or pickup points or anything along those lines. And then a separate second question for Judith. I just wanted to get your perspective on the regulatory environment in India and how that's looking for Flipkart. John Furner : Let me take the first part. We showed in the presentation earlier this idea of something called AlphaBot. That's one experiment that we're learning from in Salem, New Hampshire. And as I said, we're expanding it in a couple of more stores this year. That and similar technologies can work in distribution centers as well. So we're internally rethinking the way that we would define the supply chain. Historically, we might have thought about supply chain as the part of the business that brings something from a supplier to the back of the store. But with all the things we're doing today, including Walmart and home, the supply chain goes from point of supply all the way to the refrigerator. So every one of those pieces have to be put together and optimized the right way. And there are several different types of technology that we'll be testing, experimenting what -- to find the best way to do that. We've got some -- a market where we're running automated vehicles, for example. And then we've got, as we said, Spark. Spark is, well, our first multi-tenant platform that we built inside the company. We're tenant #1. Sam's Club will be tenant #2, and that's a platform that can be expanded. So just think of it from the point of -- that something has grown, manufactured, packaged all the way to the customer's home is the way we'll optimize this whole entire supply chain. Marc Lore : I was going to add one thing. Another way to think about how integrated the supply chain is starting to get. Imagine, we have regional distribution centers that supply stores in full truckload. Could you move product and full truckload from fulfillment center to RDC to the store and then ride the rails of last-mile delivery to someone's home where we're already delivering groceries and the GM package just rides? So there's just things like that, that we're thinking through right now. It's certainly a very sort of fluid process. Judith McKenna : So for the regulatory environment in India, what I'd say is sometimes people forget, we've been operating in India for over 10 years. This is not something that we got used to 18 months ago when we made the investments. So we've had a strong cash and carry business there throughout that time. I think actually, payment, eCommerce, legislation around the world is shifting and changing. Everybody, as these businesses grow, is learning different ways to think about how to look at them. And in an emerging market like India, with such a fast-growing part of the business, that's no different either. We continue to work with the Flipkart and the PhonePe teams very closely. Their focus on the customer, ultimately, I think, is the right thing to do. Keep doing that. And then we work with the government from a perspective of having a seat at the table to talk about these things and to work our way through them. But it's something we knew that was there when we made the investment. And seeing the results we're seeing, not just for the business itself, but in the impact they're making on broader communities, creating jobs, really thinking about how they support small micro businesses, kirana shops as well, I think, is all part of that landscape. Daniel Binder : Okay. We'll go to Simeon next and then Peter after that. Simeon Gutman : Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. You've always done a great job with your core customer. Typically in that demographic, they spend a large part of the disposable income, and you're probably getting the lion's share. The key is breaking into different demographics. That's the future. You're doing it. Your eCommerce business is growing. But can you rate your success, maybe for you, Doug, John and Marc, breaking into new customer demographics? Have you any specific examples? And then a second question for Judith on Flipkart, maybe for also Judith and Brett. When will dilution moderate? We always talk about losses are consistent with what you expected. I don't think we know exactly what you expected. Should they moderate given that it's such a volatile environment? Doug McMillon : Let's -- yes, you want to go? John Furner : Yes. Let me start with the first question, customers and demographics, and as far as a specific example to me, and I want to talk about grocery pickup. We've had a large successful grocery business for some time. And for the last few years, quality's improved, the assortment range has improved, and you've seen the business accelerate, and share go up. And when you can get into the baskets of what's being shopped in grocery pickup, we see more choice beef. We see prime beef. We see wagyu beef show up as a higher percentage. Organics and produce and grocery show up. So it appears at least part of this growth is coming from other channels in places because we've been able to marry the assortment with a service that appears -- that aligns well with someone who's time starved and has higher income levels. So inside the pickup business, really encouraging to see what's happened. And I think those quality levels then enable us to be able to appeal to that consumer across other channels like the work that Marc and the team are doing online, but some really great examples inside there item by item. Marc Lore : Yes. We've been pushing up AUR each year on dot-com as we start to break more premium brands, and we're definitely seeing new customers come in, especially with the proprietary brands with ELOQUII, Bonobos, all the brands that we've formed. Scoop is a great example. A lot of folks are new to Walmart and Walmart.com there. Doug McMillon : And then Sam's also made a pivot, Kath, to a higher income member, a few years ago. How is that going? Kathryn McLay : Yes. So that's going really well. So the move to a member whose income is about $100,000, a larger family. And what we're seeing is that's driving membership growth, and it's also driving traffic. Brett Biggs : Okay. We'll go to go Bill and then I'll go next. How about that? Judith McKenna : Just wanted to answer on the Flipkart piece of this. The way that I would think about this is we've been really clear. The dilution next year will be roughly in line with the same, as you've seen. And I think that's the guidance that we are giving. What I'll tell you about the business is no different to the U.S. We're thinking about where we invest. We're thinking about where we grow. We're thinking about where we save. We think about new revenue streams. And the great thing about both Flipkart and PhonePe, they've both got lots of levers that they can pull and be really thoughtful about the ways that they do that. Both of them, for example, are thinking about ad tech revenue, and they've got this amazingly powerful data engine that sits behind that. And I'm really encouraged by some of the results that I'm seeing from it. Daniel Binder : Got it. Peter next, and then we'll go to Karen after that. Peter Benedict : Peter Benedict at Baird. First question on kind of the services around the supercenter. When do you think you'll be ready to talk about the cadence of the rollout for the health centers? Is that something that we should expect at all this year, next year? And how does that impact, if at all, kind of your optical strategy? What you're currently doing in the store? That's my first question. John Furner : Yes. I think we'll -- let me first talk about what we've got open. We've got 2 centers open in Dallas, Georgia. We just opened our second in Calhoun a few weeks ago. And I think we're encouraged by the demand we're seeing. The number of consumers who are looking for options for health care that's quality and affordable is encouraging. Now what we've got to do over the next few months is learn how the model works and the right mix of services and how we price services. So that's work to be done, but we want to be able to get through this and get a clear understanding of where we're going with it over the next few months. In addition to just those 2 services, we also got -- we have a big pharmacy business where we think there's more opportunity to serve patients in ways other than just filling prescriptions. So think about the ability in the right places for pharmacists to practice up in their license and help with mild diagnosis, another opportunity that we can explore over time. And then the second part of your question? Peter Benedict : What -- how would it impact, if at all, kind of your current optical strategy, the optical service? John Furner : Yes. Okay. Optical is an important part of it. We've got a good optical business. We've got a remodel program that's very encouraging. Optical remodernized the shop and things inside it. And we've got equipment where we're learning about checking your vision from remote locations and using technology to streamline the consumer experience. But both businesses are quite encouraging. We know there's a big demand for it. Peter Benedict : And then, Judith, maybe one for you. Just your latest thinking around the monetization path for the Indian assets. And as you think about assets like Sam's Club and Great Value, how do you maybe use those assets in markets that maybe you don't want to operate in as a corporate entity? Is there -- are there ways to kind of maybe sweat those assets a little more? Judith McKenna : Yes. So I think I've talked about the monetization path we're seeing in the Indian businesses. It's a really interesting one in terms of us learning skills in new areas, but also thinking about use cases that can create some profitability as well for those. The one that's interesting is actually, the question on Sam's Club and how do you think about that. And you may remember that we did a transaction last year with Brazil. And one of the things we're doing in Brazil is we're still supporting the Sam's Club. Although Advent is the owner of those, and they run those. And as part of that, we still provide some of our Members Mark products into that. We still talk about how the operation runs. We still provide some training expertise to it as well. So it's a really interesting one where we're learning how we could support that in a market where we already have a 20% stake within it. So no further plans other than to learn at the moment, but it's an interesting experience for us to make sure that we can operate something in a way that can be externalized. Daniel Binder : Karen next? Karen Short : Karen Short, Barclays. John, so you mentioned that there was -- you did a click and collect order, and you noticed there was some friction that you think you can work through. So I'm wondering if you could just provide a little more color on that. And then with respect to the InHome tests that you're doing now, can you give an update on how many customers you have? And then what would be the gating factor on really aggressively -- more aggressively rolling it out? John Furner : Yes. Let me talk about the shopping experience first. First, the grocery pickup business that we built is a great offer for customers. It's got a really clear way for customers to shop in food and consumables. It offers a little bit of general merchandise, and the operation has done a great job of growing, not only with new stores, but the comps have been encouraging for the stores that have been opened for more than a year and some over 2 years. And then on the other side, we've got an application that's -- we call the blue app, and it has general merchandise in it and mostly comes from the site or from the marketplace. But inside that are embedded some really great applications for in-store tools, things like maps, lists. And customers use those and they like those tools a lot. So what's going to happen over the course of the year, we've already got about half of our users in an environment where they've got both apps in one place, and then we'll be building out an experience where you'll have search that helps you look across the portfolio, a basket where you can ring up multiple things. And then we've got to simplify, Karen, the experience when you go to the store to pick up or when you have something delivered to home. It's just hard for a customer right now that -- at times you have to flip back and forth between the app and then you have to navigate different fulfillment options. So we want to bring that all together and make it more seamless. On InHome, the retention rates are high. We haven't disclosed how many customers that are using at this time. It's only in 3 markets, but we're very encouraged by what we're learning. The NPS scores are high. The customer satisfaction that come along with that and the comments, feedback are outstanding. And it's just one more way that a customer can decide to have Walmart as a brand take friction out of their lives. And whatever is on your shopping list, it'd be great -- the most important thing is they come home and those are in their refrigerator and constantly stocked. So we're encouraged by what we're learning so far. Doug McMillon : And we didn't take it to every store in Kansas City or in Pittsburgh. It's a small number of stores. So it's a pretty small sample size right now. Karen Short : Sorry, just on that, any color on the demographics of the customer base? John Furner : Not yet. I don't think we've -- I don't think it's big enough that we would be able to tell you any of the -- their insights as far as demographics, but just generally speaking, it's pretty encouraging to see the number of people who are loving the service. And with every delivery business, whether it's InHome or Spark delivery, one of the challenges that we'll work through over the next few months is getting density in an area because the more customers you can deliver to in a neighborhood or a suburb, then it brings the efficiency of the delivery process and the cost down per delivery. Marc Lore : It's also encouraging to see the percentage of customers that are new to Walmart as well. That's very exciting. Doug McMillon : One of the things that I learned when I went to visit the Kansas City test a few weeks ago is that our own associates are using the service. It's $20 a month. And while our sample size is small, our associates make up a small percentage of that small pool, but a bunch of them are delivering into each other's homes and love it. So all kinds of people are going to use this service. It's been fun to watch them deal with each other's dogs and things like that. Daniel Binder : Okay. We're going to go to Scott first, and then we'll go to Kate all the way in back. Scott Mushkin : Again, Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. So I wanted to -- about 70% of your business is consumables if you throw pharmacy in there. It's clear that you guys with omnichannel becoming bigger in that business, have a lead with what you've done on click and collect and now delivery. I guess sitting back, though, the race is on to improve economics. You got Kroger, this partner with Ocado. Amazon that now has cut all their fees, and they're doing it for free. So how do you guys defend your lead and use, whether it's micro fulfillment, I'm a little surprised. There's only a couple more of those. How do you continue this lead and maybe even grow share in an environment where your competitors look right now that maybe they're going to have automation sooner? John Furner : Well, the simple one is you have to run a great operation. We're really proud of the progress that's been made in the stores. And Suresh talked about something earlier called the substitutability engine, which is great. But the best way to deal with substitutes is you should be in stock, the grocery areas, we got to stay in stock. And what's exciting about learning how to manage this pickup business in addition to the way we've managed stores over time is we've got an interesting inflow of information from customers telling us all the things they want to buy and how they want to buy them, which is going to lead us to a better way of designing modulars and assortments store by store. So I'm pretty excited about being able to put this customer lens into everything we do inside the store. The second is we've got more stores to go. And I don't want to say that that's where all the growth is going to come from, but that'll help. The more markets that we can cover and get this service out. And then third, adding on the ability to be able to fulfill this in a number of ways that's seamless is probably the thing -- I've said this a couple of times and I'll just say it again, it's what I'm most excited about is bringing these 2 apps together and having a customer-centered view of how we think of all the things in their lives, whether it's a busy Saturday and they're trying to get refreshments for the soccer game or it's a birthday party or the weekly grocery shop or the new deli that we can have either one of our associates go into or a service pick up and run dinner home. We've got a really great portfolio there. We've just got to build it all out so that the customer thinks of us as default the way that Doug's mother thought about when she went shopping at Walmart. Doug McMillon : I think the speed of automation is important. It's also important to get the right kind of automation. And when you think about the stores, as we've done with AlphaBot, having the same inbound freight in some of the last mile being shared with this automation on the side of the box instead of some huge center that does grocery automation, that's an interesting choice that time will tell which one was the right one. Daniel Binder : Here, we'll go to Kate next. Katharine McShane : Okay. Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs. My question is on gross margin. It sounds like you're implying that it will be down this year. I think that was answered earlier. But what would have to happen for gross margins to be stable to up, even if it is a continued error of price investment? Brett Biggs : Well, we want gross margins to be stable or up because we want to drive the productivity loop. We just have to get the SG&A savings to be at a faster rate than the gross margin investments that we make, Kate. So I don't think there is necessarily a place where we rest on gross margin. I think we're constantly going to be trying to find a way to give a better value to customers. John Furner : Yes. I think the -- I talked about it earlier, the sustainable way to drive everyday low price is by bringing the cost down. And the best way to bring cost down is to sell more because cost is a denominator. And then if you can continue to chase SG&A down, line-by-line expense management, and I talked about a few of those earlier, we'd like margins to reflect the decrease in SG&A because we want to give customers a better value. Daniel Binder : We'll go to Greg Melich right up front. And then we'll go to Kelly right after that. Gregory Melich : Greg Melich, Evercore ISI. John, maybe to follow up on that. If we went back at Sam's a couple of years ago, I think the decision to repurpose 60 clubs as fulfillment centers and really move ahead on omnichannel. Now that you've had a few months in the Walmart U.S. role, do you see a similar shift in how you use those assets to optimize for productivity going forward? Or is it a totally different kind of shift in the U.S.? John Furner : Well, we're still thinking through the entire supply chain from end-to-end. And so I don't think I'd be ready to say today the right way is on the supply chain, whether it's the fulfillment centers, distribution center stores or number of nodes, we've got to work through and make sure we're serving the customers the best way we can. And the stores, our stores people shop in, that also fulfill. So I don't want the message to be that we're thinking of the stores as fulfillment centers where you shop. They are stores that can fulfill. And what we've done in the business, I think, that's quite helpful is maximizing and optimizing the number of slots and then creating the minimum amount of disruption so that stores can be great supercenters with a great produce department, meat department, bakery and have a really high functioning general merchandise area all throughout the building, but we can still fulfill orders at a pretty high rate. Judith McKenna : Sorry, John, I'm just going to add to that, which is, if you got -- we've got a business in the U.K., which is a home shopping business, which is online shopping, which is 15 years old. They've got some higher densities already, higher pick rates. They've been up there for a much longer period of time. And there is still -- they don't have a completely different layout in the stores, but the density of pick rates, in many cases, will be higher. So I think there is still a lot of learnings that we can do through that. China, though, the other way, they're starting to lay out stores slightly differently so that they can respond much faster as the time to deliver is coming down rapidly. That we're trying to start some of the deliveries out in 40 minutes. So it evolves as well with the customer offer, and we've got this benefit seen around the world how different people are doing it, learning from how you drive density so you don't have to go to dark stores. But equally, if you do have to change their layouts a little, you can do that without disrupting the customer's experience. John Furner : And Kath, we are pleased with the eCommerce fulfillment that's happening out of those clubs that we're using. Kathryn McLay : Yes. We are. So we've seen, over the last year, one, that helped us grow. So it gave us extra capacity, but it also helped us substantially reduce our shipment cost as well, our fulfillment cost side of it as well. The other part that I think is exciting is looking at ship from club, which gives you a whole another 600 stores, which you can use as points to leverage as well. And that -- if we look at club pick up, ship from club, direct-to-home and using these clubs that we've turned dark, it's really given us a great kind of network to go after the omni sale. Gregory Melich : Doug, my follow up for that, and we could pass it off as you want. If they think about how we expand the addressable market for Walmart and also monetize all this great customer traffic and productivity loop. I think we bought Jet. We bought Flipkart as ways to expand. Amazon's built an $11 billion advertising business. I think in the past, you talked about... Doug McMillon : And I think it's more organic than through acquisitions. There may be periodic acquisitions, obviously, can't rule that out, but the opportunity to build digital products, which is part of the point of the panel, you've now got a situation where across the company, we're learning how to build experiences that you can monetize and tack on to the core business. I think I said something earlier about we're attaching digital products and businesses to the people and physical core businesses that we built over time. That's a big opportunity. And it can relate and will relate to financial services. We have a financial services business now in the U.S. Obviously, we've talked a lot about phone pay today. There's an opportunity in Mexico. That exists across the company in all these different markets. In the U.S., you can weave in with payment more successfully than we have so far, other use cases that help drive a financial services wheel. Then there's health care services. Advertising has grown faster than sales. We want to be thoughtful about how we grow that advertising business and not have it pollute the customer experience, either online or in store. So there's kind of a management governor on how big and how fast we want to make that, but it will grow faster than sales. We've got a great opportunity to do that. Are there others? Yes, there are. We are choosing not to make a big investment in digital entertainment. There's plenty of money being used by others to do that. We can use ours to do something else. And so there will be an opportunity for us to have partnerships in the digital entertainment space. And as we've described to you before, we do think about what's strategic and core that would cause us to lean towards can we build it. As it relates to acquisitions, can they bring speed and expertise that would be better than building? And then with what's left, how do you partner to create open systems where people win-win? We have a history of enabling people to win by doing business with Walmart. We think that, that can be done in the future with all kinds of people beyond just product suppliers. Daniel Binder : We'll go to Kelly next. Kelly Bania : Kelly Bania, BMO Capital. A couple of eCommerce-related questions. In terms of the initiative to map the general merchandise more for the same-day availability, what's the timing and expectations for that? Because I assume that could have a big impact on gross margin there. And then we've talked a lot about InHome, but not as much as grocery unlimited. And just curious how that's going, what kind of incrementality you're seeing. Are you seeing people kind of -- your customers trade up from pick up to delivery? Or is that a new customer? Just any insights on that? Doug McMillon : Well, go ahead. John Furner : Yes. Let me take the second one first. It's a mix. There are customers who are shopping in the store who go straight to delivery, others who have moved from the store to pick up, others we've gained from other places, either a pick up or delivery that are now using the service. So it's only been a few months but encouraging results so far. We're happy with the number of people who have signed up monthly and then annually. So we're happy with that. And then the first part of your question, just to make sure I heard it? Kelly Bania : [indiscernible] John Furner : So we've got a percentage of the store now that's available for pickup in what we call the orange app, and priority one is to get the apps merged together so that we can start expanding assortments and we can do things like align our catalogs so that we know who our customer is and with knowing that the customers are shopping, that'll help us understanding intent. They can emerge -- align this with a catalog of products across the entire store and then beyond the store so that we can be more predictive and serve them in the way they want to be served. But we're working on it every day and being on it every week. Doug McMillon : Expect to make a lot of progress in picking GM in-store during the course of the year. So just to repeat something that John said, you can, today, go out on the grocery app, the orange app, and you could buy back-to-school. And moms love it. So they just take their list from the school, and it populates. That's a great example of the fact that we can already do it and how much they want it. But we do have to stitch these 2 together as soon as we can and obviously do that well. Marc Lore : I'll just add on one app, and I think it is super important, as John mentioned. But as we start to bring these 2 together, we're not asking customers to have to download 2 apps. And so we could really start to leverage that relationship we've built on same-day delivery and Delivery Unlimited and pick up to then sell more long tail GM on Walmart.com. We've already now -- we got about 50% of the traffic on Walmart.com that's seen the grocery app. And we're seeing a nice lift from that. So hopefully, when we do it the other way around, we actually show blue app, the Walmart.com to grocery customers, we see a similar type of bump. So yes, it's a very important part of our strategy. John Furner : And I think that's an important point. I think what's interesting is there are customers who are only using one app or the other and unaware of the other one. So we merge them together. Seeing customers who are using blue get an orange and vice versa has been encouraging so far. Doug McMillon : Before I get corrected, I think I said moms can use it. Dads can use it, too. I just said moms because it's been moms that have liked hugged my neck. Literally, when I go to a store, I almost always go out to the pickup area. And for 2 years in a row, when I've gone out to that spot, I've seen moms that have a grocery order with their back-to-school list, and they say things like, I don't have to throw elbows with the other parents to get my school supplies. Do you know how great this is? And one of them literally hugged me. So moms and dads would both love it, I'm sure. Daniel Binder : And we're going to go to the other side of the room, Chris, and then we'll go to Oliver after that. Chris  Mandeville: Yes. Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Just on Sam's. So a lot of positive comments today. Renewal rates improving, membership count accelerating or MFI accelerating year-on-year. But I'm curious, with respect to the guide, how do I square the fact that comps are maybe looking to decelerate a little bit on both the 1 year, 2 year? Is there something that I might be missing? And then I've got a follow-up. Kathryn McLay : Sorry. So that I can understand. So did you say that comps are decelerating? Chris  Mandeville: Correct. Yes. So the guide is basically 3% for this coming year, whereas it was 3.5% last and the two-year outlook as well. Kathryn McLay : Okay. Yes. So I mean we still see there being growth. We're still saying that we are investing into meeting the member where they want us to from an omni perspective and also driving traffic. So -- I mean, it's down a little bit. But I'm not seeing it decelerating. Chris  Mandeville: And then separately, just long-term strategy with respect to capital allocation, you made a few efforts in pushing upstream in the supply chain. How critical is that on a go-forward basis? And just any early color with respect to the returns that you're seeing thus far? John Furner : Yes. The way we're thinking about supply chain, and I'll talk to you about the stores first, is we've got a number of experiments going on in the supply chain. And one we're working through a product called Symbotic in Florida that helps us palletize items for neighborhood markets and for supercenters so that they can be delivered on pallets by aisle, and we're pretty excited about the results we've seen so far. But that helps the associates in the store. And as a result of helping the associate, it helps the customer because we're in stock. And as things come in from the back of the store onto the sales floor, it's much easier for the product we take in straight to the aisle and put on to the counter. So all these things we're doing, whether it's in the dry supply chain, the perishable supply chain, the meat plant or the dairy plant, we're thinking about the end user in mind, and it's not just a point of assembling something to pull cost out of a silo because we don't want to suboptimize. We want to optimize the entire network from top to bottom. Oliver Chen : It's Oliver Chen, Cowen & Company. Regarding machine learning, part of the opportunity is scale in the training set. What do you see happening across the connected data set as well as inventory management as you transition to prescriptive analytics? And an emerging topic for younger customers is also privacy and transparency around data. So we'd love your thoughts. And I had a follow-up. John Furner : Let me start with ML in the supply chain. We're working on processes upstream to help narrow down the positive rate of forecasting, in other words, eliminate some of the compounded errors you have because the supply chain starts with the forecast. And then as product moves from start all the way to finish, variability and things like receiving times or traffic patterns, weather, can create these rates. But as you narrow the tolerance down transaction by transaction and work all the failure points out, we can get to a point where inventory is more real-time, there's less extra inventory in the store. And I'm pretty excited about some of the work streams that the team between Suresh and a person named [ Srini ] are working on. So forecasting is a big piece of it. And then we're thinking about -- you've heard us talk about perpetual inventory before. We've got products that work in the stores that help us correct on hands if they're wrong. But we're also trying to serve -- solve the reason they're wrong with ML from top to bottom so that the store associates have a better experience with on-hands being right, which helps us again with in-stock. Anything more to add on the customer and data? I think Suresh is still miked up, if you would stand up? Suresh Kumar : Yes. So like you said, the main thing about that - I'm miked up but I'm not -- the mic is not turned on. So in addition to what John was saying, one of the things that we are trying to do with ML is actually make use of the data that we have already -- that we are collecting, right? So there is a bunch of data where we can bring it together in such a way that we can train models on it. And one of the things that we are really excited about is that areas where we can draw inferences about customer behavior in such a way that we can actually help the customer experience are the areas where we believe that there is greatest potential, okay? Whether it is -- I mean, I talked about substitutions. That's one example. But there are many areas where we can take the information that we have about our customer, train models on it so that we can go back and improve the customer experience. And that sets up the positive flywheel that I was talking about. Supply chain is just one area. But there are many, many of these customer experiences where ML is actually going to continue to enhance the customer experience. Doug McMillon : Back to the bigger picture of trust and privacy, we feel like we've earned a certain amount of trust from customers over time, and we just want to build that. We certainly don't want to lose it. And Rachel, if you wouldn't mind, grab a microphone. Rachel Brand leads our governance area, compliance, ethics, legal. And Rachel, you recently created a new position within the company to help us think through all these issues. Rachel, Dan Bartlett, myself, we spend a lot of time thinking about how we set the company up to not only have an effective business model but manage privacy in a way that it accrues trust to the company even more so, especially if we want to do things like be in the customers' home, servicing them with groceries, they have to trust us. And they have to trust how we're handling their data. Rachel Brand : So data and technology is such an important part of the company. It was coming up in just about every conversation I was in. So I -- to my organization and pulled the existing privacy resources and created a new SVP level. We call it SVP for Digital Citizenship, which is a term that I came up with to convey that this is not just a legal issue. It's about building trust with the customer. There are a lot of issues adjacent to privacy, like responsible use of AI. We want to do all of that in the way that fosters the notion that trust is a competitive advantage for Walmart. So we hired what I like to call a world-famous privacy expert, Nuala O'Connor, who had recently been the President of an NGO. She's a real expert in both the legal and sort of policy and reputational aspects of privacy and all those issues. So we think we're on the right track. Kathryn McLay : Can I just add on to that to say, I think in the past too we've always used history, whereas we're in a position right now where we can look forward. So if you think about a forecast, it's always been, well, what do we sell similar week last year? Now we can actually scrape other people's websites to see what they've got on promotion. We can have a look at social media and see what events are happening. And you also know the individual buying patterns of your members or customers so you can anticipate what they're going to purchase. So it is flipping the world in regard to how you actually get in front of the purchase. And I think about it from a Sam's Club perspective, we're now also tailoring our offers in our instant savings book. So on the back page of the book, we'll actually create offers for individual members to start to draw them along that purchase path because we know that they'll be more loyal and sticky if we get them into Members Mark. Well, we know if we can actually get them to use optical that, that becomes a customer or a member who is with you for a longer period. And so how do we design offers that actually encourage them to participate with us even more than they have in the past? Daniel Binder : Great. We'll go to Joe. Joseph Feldman : Joseph Feldman, Telsey Advisory. I actually wanted to piggyback on that. Where are you with doing that at Walmart? And like, is there a potential for a loyalty program at some point at Walmart? Maybe it includes the InHome service and some of the other things? Like, have you thought about something more comprehensive because at Sam's Club, you know the customer. You know exactly what they buy. But at Walmart, you don't really. You know what masses of people do, but how do you get more tailored to that customer? Doug McMillon : I think in today's world and tomorrow's, we have to personalize for customers. And Walmart's got to create one view of the customer and then put it to work. One of the key questions will be for which use cases? And we really believe in everyday low price for Walmart supercenters. The benefits of flowing inventory in an EDLP business model are significant. So what we wouldn't want to do is start down the path of an old-school loyalty program and high-low that creates all this disruption in the supply chain. But there are plenty of use cases. You bought that tie, you'll like this one. Or you bought this Nike top or -- we don't carry Nike yet in the Walmart stores. I hope they're listening. Maybe -- you bought this, so you want that. You brought up -- you bought a printer so you need ink or things that you're buying -- many use cases that we can do using data that will help us earn more trust, drive the loop. And we'll do those things, and we'll do it as quickly as we can do it. But we need to be really careful which use cases we adopt within the Walmart brand. Daniel Binder : We go to Robbie next. Robert Ohmes : Robbie Ohmes, Bank of America Securities. When -- a lot of great questions on pickup and the app. Just longer term, and I think somebody was asking this before, is there an opportunity to really meaningfully move general merchandise online fulfillment to the store level? And could that start to make your gross margin improve in the dot-com business? Is there -- we obviously wouldn't see it in fiscal '21, but how important is that relative to being a comp driver? And how much further can you go in fulfilling from store using shipping partners as well? Is there -- are there real opportunities over a 5-year basis to dramatically improve the profitability of the U.S. online? John Furner : Well, we do a few things already, I think, that would help answer the question. As we said earlier, we've got the pickup business. We have general merchandise categories that are in that during seasonal times of the year, and we have the ability now in many stores to deliver from the store to the home. And then as we align these shopping experiences, then we'll be able to pick more and more of the supercenter and deliver it same day. So we believe that's an important piece of the solution and should have all the benefits you just talked about. But again, it's a part of the solution. I wouldn't want to say that delivering from store is the answer because it's a part of the answer. Part of the answer may be deliver from store and deliver from an FC, depending on the order or move all of it to the FC. So we're conscious, I think, through the timing of all these changes and steps that over time build out the ability to do all those things. Brett Biggs : And then on -- Robert Ohmes : Sorry. Go ahead. Brett Biggs : Just keep in mind, the marginal cost to deliver a GM item out of a store when it's already going with the grocery is very small. So that's a big opportunity as we expand assortment to sort of leverage the basket. Pharmacy is another good example of being able to get that in the basket to increase size. But ultimately, I think the real opportunity to drive mix is really in that long tail, and we're doing that in home and fashion and marketplace. I think that's the really big opportunity. Marc Lore : And increasingly happening with a membership fee that goes along with it. We didn't talk about Delivery Unlimited as much. That was not necessarily intentional. We have a membership program. We're starting to learn how to sell the membership, and it's something we can build on with same-day delivery from the supercenters, including GM. Robert Ohmes : And then just on pickup. A couple of times, I think Brett said it first. So the stores that are comping pickup, what is driving the comp? Is it the same people using it more? Is it new people still coming in and so therefore, the pickups are comping? What are the bigger drivers to stores that are in a pickup and are already comping? Brett Biggs : It's both of those things. Over the last 3 to 4 years, as we've expanded, we've seen more frequent usage, and we've seen new customers come in to pick up either from somewhere outside of the environment or from inside of the environment. So it's just a mix of all those and really happy with the growth rates we've seen over the last few years. Robert Ohmes : And last thing, are there stores where pickup is too high where it's creating problems for the shopper experience and things like that? And how many stores? And how do you -- what do you do in those situations? Brett Biggs : Well, we've got a number of things that we've been working on. First, the time slot issue that Suresh talked about earlier, helping customers find a slot that is meaningful -- that works for their schedule and ours as well. So we're trying to do a nice job of spreading out the picking in stores. And then we've got a number of stores and markets. So if you were thinking about a market like Chicago or Dallas where we've got multiple stores in an area, we're also testing ways to pick in stores while they're closed and then move the inventory, either through a van that's driven by a person or automated van or autonomous vehicle so that we can move from place to place. So we're looking at all the ways we can to try to spread the volume out. John Furner : We do cap in quite a few stores. The demand is higher than what we will fulfill because we don't want to destroy the experience in the store, which brings you back to how fast can you automate, where to automate. Daniel Binder : I think we probably have time for 1 more or 2 more. Rupesh, and then Ed, we'll make you the last one after that. Rupesh Parikh : Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer. So on the grocery delivery front, I was curious what opportunities do you see to lower grocery delivery fees. And then as you look at your consumer surveys, how important is it to your consumers to have grocery delivery close to 0? John Furner : What was the last part? Rupesh Parikh : How -- as you look at your consumer surveys, how important is free grocery delivery for your consumers? Unknown Executive : Free grocery delivery. John Furner : Yes. We'll end up doing a membership in larger numbers, and the fee itself may go down some over time as we figure out autonomous and how we pick. But our front foot will be on a membership fee. Marc Lore : Yes. That's right. That's right. So you've got options today where you can pay by the transaction. You can pay monthly or you can pay one fee for the year. And so we're just now in the beginning of learning which of those customers like the most. And it's only been a couple of months, but we'll learn. Daniel Binder : Ed, you get the lucky last question. Edward Kelly : Ed Kelly, Wells Fargo. So just a follow up on grocery. And as it relates to pickup, you've clearly led the market in this strategy. What do you think the biggest drivers of that have been? How much of it is the fact that you're not charging versus the fact that your peers are? How much of it is related to the fact that operationally, the execution just seems better? And then what happens when competitors eliminate their fee? And how does that impact your business? And then unrelated, I did want to ask you about supply chain related to coronavirus. And the question there is how much of what you're selling is on true replenishment? How much inventory do you have? How long before we need to start worrying about the fact that it could create inventory issues if supply chain in China really doesn't begin to open back up more normally? John Furner : Yes. Let me take the first question on pickup. And I believe the question was, when you look across the operation that we have, which is don't charge, and we're able to fulfill customers' basket today, what happens if others do it? I think then the most important thing that we would always focus on, and I think we'll be talking about this next year and years to come, is having the very best quality items and great values inside the store. If you get the assortment right and then the mechanism for delivery, it makes it much easier and much easier for us and the customer. But -- and the reason I think the growth is it's about the customer. People are busier than they've ever been. We're all trying to tackle lots of things, and this is a great service that fills in a big void. On the second part of the question, like we said earlier, it's just early to tell. And we're first concerned about our supplier partners, our associates in the country, our sourcing associates, associates who work in Walmart China. So we're thinking about them first and foremost. And as we learn more about what's going on, we'll be able to tell more the impacts. I think some categories will be sooner than others, and it just depends on the lead time and how quickly the supply chains move in the categories. Kathryn McLay : It is worth saying, John, I think that one of the things that we've learned over the last few years through our global sourcing that our merchants have got much closer to the detail of thinking about how the flow of projects come into our business. So they know exactly which orders are in which factories, when they're due to come in and what that looks like. And I think that attention to detail as we go through this, even though it's such a fluid situation, will help us understand better as things become clearer, exactly what the impacts for us would be in the future. Daniel Binder : With that, we're going to wrap up our Q&A. Doug McMillon : Yes. I just -- we'll close by saying thank you. And Brett may want to say a word, too. We appreciate the relationship that we have with the investment community. We're trying to do the best job we can for you of laying out what our opportunities are. We've got a really strong team, not just the people that are represented in this room, but 2 million plus that are working to make these things happen. And as we walk out of this room today, we know yesterday's yesterday, we're focused on driving speed, innovation and execution so that we can continue to have strong results. We appreciate the engagement that we have with you. Brett Biggs : Yes. Not that I need to encourage this probably, but keep giving us feedback on how we communicate, what we're communicating, how often we're communicating. It helps us get better as we think about these events and other things we do in the future. But I really appreciate all the feedback you give us. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Thanks, everybody. Daniel Binder : So with that, the formal part of our meeting has concluded, and our webcast has ended. As I mentioned earlier, we have lunch available upstairs where you can spend some time with our executive team. Thank you for your interest.",

At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Dan Binder. Mr. Binder, you may now begin. Daniel Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to Walmart's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I'm joined by several members of our executives team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Marc Lore, President and CEO, Walmart U.S. eCommerce; and Dan Bartlett, Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you an update on the business and discuss first quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our first quarter results and how we're positioned in the business. Given the amount of disruption and volatility, we and the rest of the world have faced in recent months, we developed a set of 5 priorities to guide our decision-making since the crisis began, and I'll use them to frame my comments. They are, one, support our associates that are serving on the front line; two, serve our customers that need access to food and critical supplies; three, help others, including the communities we serve, new associates looking for work, suppliers we partner with, those that lease space in our stores, plus the work of federal state and local governments; four, manage the short term well operationally and financially, including our cash position and inventory level; and five, drive our strategy forward, even as we navigate a crisis. First, our associates. They have been flat out amazing. They're dedicated and hardworking. They continue to adapt as crisis challenges us to work differently. More than ever, I think society sees them and appreciate their service to others as do I. So our first priority has been supporting them. In every country where we operate, their physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being have been at the top of our list. In the U.S., we've done that by providing extra paying benefits, including 2 special cash bonuses to all hourly associates and assistant managers in our stores, Sam's Clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers. We've also accelerated payment of first quarter bonuses and made it possible for hourly associates to access their earned pay weekly rather than every 2 weeks in order to help them with their personal finances. We've done similar things in our international markets to support and reward associates. From an operational standpoint, we reduced store hours to allow for additional cleaning and sanitizing. We posted social distancing decals, implemented protocols for temperature checks, began metering the number of customers in a store or club at any one time and installed sneeze guards at pharmacies and checkouts. Also, all associates are required to wear face coverings, which we've provided to them. Since the middle of March, we've hired more than 235,000 associates in the United States, the majority on a temporary basis, to help relieve some of the burden faced by our associates in stores and supply chain facilities as well as to help provide opportunities for people who've been displaced from their previous jobs. Beyond financial and operational efforts, we've implemented a number of benefits to support associates' health and well-being. These have included a new COVID-19 emergency leave policy and waiving the co-pay for assessments using Doctor on Demand for associates and family members covered by a Walmart health plan. We're pursuing strategies with testing associates for the virus, including, in the longer term, antibody testing. Of course, COVID-19 has affected many communities and our people. We have felt the impact of this awful virus within our Walmart family, and we mourn the loss of some of our own. Our hearts go out to their families. Our front-line associates have always been the priority in our company, and through this crisis, they're playing an important role in each country's ability to respond. We continue to support them and look for ways to operate as safely as possible.  After supporting our associates, our next priority is serving customers. In the U.S., the first quarter started out as expected, but as the pandemic spread, we saw the mix of sales shift heavily toward food and consumables, as we had previously experienced in China. This was the first stock-up phase that we all saw so vividly. We experienced unprecedented demand in categories like paper goods, surface cleaners and grocery staples. For many of these items, we were selling in 2 or 3 hours what we normally sell in 2 or 3 days. As the quarter progressed, we saw a second phase related to entertaining and educating at home. Puzzles and video games took off. Parents became teachers. Adult bicycles started selling out as parents started to join the kids. An overlapping trend then started emerging related to DIY and home-related activities. Think games, home office, exercise equipment and the like. It was also clear a lot of people were taking a do-it-yourself approach as they bought items like bandanas and sewing machines to make masks. We can see customers looking to improve their indoor and outdoor living spaces. Our home categories, in stores and online took off. Toward the end of the quarter, another phase emerged, call it relief spending, as it was heavily influenced by stimulus dollars, leading to sales increases in categories such as apparel, televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys. Discretionary categories really popped towards the end of the quarter. Our supply chain is amongst the most capable in the world, but in this environment, we've stretched it. Not only have products in categories like hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and sprays, toilet paper, beef and pork have been hard to find, but items such as laptops, office chairs and fabric have been cleared out in some of our stores and online. We're working to recover our in-stock position as we begin the second quarter. From an inventory standpoint, we ended the quarter down about 8%, but we have higher levels of inventory in some areas and lower-than-desired levels in others. We're working intensely to improve in-stocks for high-demand items and adjusting order volumes and taking markdowns on items that have moved more slowly. We expect the environment to stay quite volatile in the coming weeks and months. Brett will discuss that more in a minute. The third priority for us has been to help others. Because some of our suppliers and tenants are feeling pressure, we've taken steps to support them. In some instances, we're able to provide greater flexibility with delivery windows. We've also simplified the process to qualify for our supply chain finance program. For our in-store tenants, we waived or discounted rent through April and May. Community organizations that serve as a social safety net are under incredible pressure, too. We're helping them through Walmart and the Walmart Foundation. We've given more than $35 million to COVID-19 relief and response initiatives, with $10 million of this focused on food security in the U.S. We continue food donations from our stores and DCs to local food banks and have found new ways to engage our customers in support of this effort. Finally, we're collaborating with federal and state governments. In March, we were asked to stand up testing sites for COVID-19 in some of our parking lots. As of today, we've opened 139 sites and we expect to open an additional 44 more by the end of May. We've also asked some of our apparel suppliers to convert production to PPE for health care workers. This has led to nearly 2 million additional medical gowns in our country supplied to date, and we expect roughly 10 million will be added by the end of June through our partnership with McKesson. We also partnered with Salesforce and State Farm to provide face masks mass and shoe coverings to health care workers. I'm proud of what we've done as a company over the past several weeks. I'm really proud of how our people have stepped up. As we've supported associates and served customers and communities, we've also been able to effectively manage the business and continue to make progress against our long-term strategy. During this extraordinary period, we've continued our everyday low-price discipline, and we continue to build trust with customers, some of whom are trying our products and services for the first time. Despite strong ticket growth in sales in the first quarter, mix shifts negatively affected gross margin and we incurred higher cost to operate. Our increasingly seamless omnichannel customer proposition is resonating. This strategy positions the company well during this crisis, and we remain convinced that it will in the future. Before this crisis, we were already seeing robust adoption of online pickup and delivery. As this crisis created a need for social distancing and required people to stay at home, customers embraced pickup and delivery even more. Pickup and delivery are attracting greater numbers of new customers. The number of new customers trying pickup and delivery has increased 4x since mid-March. We expanded slot capacity as demands swell, and we've increased the number of general merchandise items available to choose from. I think it's time we stop referring to our supercenter pickup and delivery capability as online grocery, because it's becoming much more than grocery. Beyond expanding the assortment, we also created a pickup hour specifically for those at risk and for first responders. And we worked with the USDA to expand the SNAP online pilot to more states. Walmart.com also saw a surge in demand during the quarter as customers opted for greater convenience and increased social distancing. The U.S. eCommerce business grew 74% in total. Growth in marketplace outpaced the overall business, even as first-party sales were strong. In the U.S., we quickly rolled out ship-from-store and we're now temporarily fulfilling orders placed on walmart.com through about 2,500 of our stores. We also launched Express Delivery to provide customers the convenience of having their orders delivered to their door in under 2 hours. The Express Delivery is [indiscernible] from nearly 1,000 stores today, and our goal is to be in around 2,000 stores by the end of June. Our tech teams are continuing to execute. For example, we've launched more than 70 new or accelerated capabilities in response to the virus. We've done this while staying focused on core products, like One app and Express Delivery, as well as building out the next-gen tech stack. We talked to you in New York about that a bit. Even as we continue to drive our strategy, we're maintaining discipline. We're reducing expenses in areas outside of the stores and clubs like hiring above store level, management consulting services and, of course, travel. We're continuing to review other areas of the business for efficiency opportunities. One decision we've made is to discontinue Jet.com. While the brand name may still be used in the future, our resources, people and financial have been dominated by the Walmart brand because it has so much traction. We're seeing the Walmart brand resonate regardless of income, geography or age. The Jet acquisition was critical to jump-starting the progress we've made the last few years. Not only have we picked up traction with pickup and delivery, but our Walmart.com nonfood eCommerce growth accelerated after the arrival of Marc and the Jet team. He leaned into the Walmart brand quickly. We don't anticipate a significant accounting charge due to this decision, and the vast majority of associates have previously been assigned to the Walmart brand. At Sam's Club in the U.S., the value of a membership has never been more evident, and they've been growing strong in eCommerce as well. Sam's tested and implemented a pickup and delivery service in pharmacy and instituted concierge drive-up service for seniors and others at risk. I'm really proud of the work of our international markets. They've served customers during this time period in a terrific way. In the quarter, Mexico and China led the way with strong sales through omnichannel and Sam's Club. Our 26 international countries are experiencing different effects and timing as it relates to COVID-19. Except for Canada, April falls into Q2 for our international markets, and we can tell you it was a challenging month. We expect that to continue in several markets throughout our second quarter. The closure of stores and warehouses in some of our markets contributed to volatility in sales for the quarter, and we expect even more in Q2. For instance, the Flipkart business was limited by government regulation to selling only essential items for several weeks. And in South Africa, a large number of stores were closed. But broadly speaking, in each market, our teams are stepping up to serve customers and help their communities.  I want to close where I began, by thanking our associates. We're more grateful to them than I can articulate. The effect this virus is having around the world has made it clear that we all need to do everything they can to help each other and our communities get through this. At Walmart, we're blessed to have a unique set of assets and a strong business that puts us in a good position to support our associates and serve our customers, communities and shareholders. I wish you and your family's good health, and I look forward to seeing you in person when the time is right. Thank you for our interest -- for your interest in our company. Brett? Brett Biggs : Yes. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Before reviewing our first quarter results, I want to add my thanks to associates for their amazing efforts serving our customers and our communities. I'm so proud of the extraordinary dedication of our people and the agility of this company. Due to the health crisis, the first quarter had the broadest set of challenges we've ever faced globally, including varying government regulations, significant sales variability, mix shifts and channel shifts due to changing consumer habits. All of this led to significantly higher-than-anticipated sales but lower gross margin rates and higher expenses, which I'll discuss shortly. Our omnichannel investments have us in a unique position to serve customers in ways others can't. Customers are gravitating towards store pickup and delivery, driving record demand for these services, leading to triple-digit growth in U.S. eCommerce sales during peak periods. The strategic importance of providing multiple options for customers has never been clearer. We continue leaning in aggressively in key areas, but also maintaining discipline. We've accelerated investments in omni fulfillment solutions, quickly increased ship-from-store capabilities, hired a significant number of personal shoppers, expanded pickup slots and launched Express Delivery, all within a matter of weeks. As we incur additional costs to support increased sales, associate customer care, increased cleaning, new associate hiring and the like, I'm proud of the team for maintaining cost discipline in other areas. We've delayed certain consulting projects, reduced marketing and travel, prioritized capital and have frozen most new corporate hiring. The company's financial position remains very strong. We have extensive access to the capital markets and ended the quarter with quite a bit more cash than normal, ensuring we can do what's needed with the utmost flexibility in the coming months. So with this context in mind, let's discuss Q1 results. Total constant currency revenue was exceptionally strong with growth of nearly 10% at more than $135 billion. Each segment delivered strong sales growth despite operating limitations in some markets. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 10%; International net sales grew almost 8% in constant currency; and Sam's Club grew comp sales over 16%, excluding fuel and tobacco. Consolidated gross profit margin declined 66 basis points due primarily to the carryover of last year's price investments, the shift in sales mix to lower-margin categories, the shift in channel mix toward eCommerce and some general merchandise markdowns. SG&A leverage was negatively affected by incremental costs related to customer associate support during the health crisis. Despite the incremental costs, we leveraged expenses by over 60 basis points. In total, incremental operating costs related to health crisis were about $900 million in Q1, with about 3/4 going to associate bonuses and expanded benefits. Operating income was up over 5% and adjusted EPS increased about 4% to $1.18 versus last year's Q1 adjusted EPS. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted EPS by about $0.02. Given the increased sales level, reduced inventory levels and operating discipline, operating cash flow roughly doubled versus last year, and free cash flow was up $3.9 billion versus last year. Inventory was down about 8% year-on-year due to heightened demand and currency impacts. Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 10% with eCommerce sales growth of 74%. While we don't normally provide monthly comp sales, it's important to understand the flow of the quarter. eCommerce sales remained strong throughout the quarter, while store traffic was quite variable due to the various stay-in-place orders and social distancing around the country. February sales were stronger than expected, with comp sales up 3.8%. When the health crisis intensified in mid-March, we saw a surge in stock-up trips, with March comps increasing about 15%. Store pickup and delivery spiked in March and remained elevated in April, with sales growth of nearly 300% at the peak. Store sales slowed during the first half of April due to soft Easter seasonal sales and additional social distancing measures. In mid-April, sales reaccelerated across the business as government stimulus money reached consumers, with general merchandise sales particularly strong. April comp sales increased 9.5%. During the quarter, we saw customers consolidate shopping trips and purchased larger baskets in stores, which drove a ticket increase of about 16%, while transactions decreased about 6%. With the shift in purchasing behavior, eCommerce sales contributed approximately 390 basis points to the segment comp. Pickup and delivery services continue to run historically high volumes. We've had a solid start to May in the U.S., but we believe stimulus spending has been a big driver, which we don't anticipate staying at these levels throughout the quarter. Throughout the first quarter, we maintained our everyday low price discipline and continued to grow trust with customers, many of which tried new products and services for the first time. Despite strong sales, the carryover of last year's price investments and the unfavorable shift in category channel mix pressured the gross margin rate by over 100 basis points. Category mix shifts included increased sales of lower-margin food and consumable categories and softer sales in higher-margin categories like apparel, which declined about 14% in the quarter. Seasonal markdowns and the temporary closure of our auto care centers and vision centers also pressured the margin rate. Strong sales helped us leverage expenses by almost 90 basis points despite the approximate $670 million of incremental costs related to the health crisis. Operating income was up 3.9% for the quarter, which includes lower losses for eCommerce. Inventory declined about 6% in Q1, reflecting higher-than-normal out-of-stocks in some categories. We took appropriate general merchandise markdowns in Q1 and feel good about our position going into Q2. International net sales increased 7.8% in constant currency, with 9 of 10 markets posting positive comp sales. Currency fluctuations were significant during the quarter with a negative sales effect of approximately $1.3 billion. We experienced substantial sales volatility in market due to changing consumer shopping patterns, reduced our operating hours and closed stores and warehouses. Customers focused on pantry stock-up and reduced purchases of nonessential categories. International operating income increased 15.6% in constant currency and 9.2% on a reported basis. As a result of the crisis, toward the end of the quarter, we had a pretty extensive store and operational closures in markets like South Africa, India and in the Central American countries. For example, 25% of stores in Africa were closed, and our Flipkart operations were impacted by restrictions on nonessential deliveries. Recall that all markets other than Canada are on a 1-month reporting lag. So the crisis-related impacts will be more extensive in Q2 versus Q1. As March and April progressed, we saw economic pressure, channel shift and mix shifts in most of our markets, with significant April sales declines in Flipkart, Africa and the U.K., although U.K. was mainly fuel related. We anticipate some significant operating profit pressure at least through the second quarter. In China, we've seen operations gradually stabilize. All stores are open and customers are beginning to purchase more discretionary categories again, though not at pre-crisis levels. Omnichannel sales in China increased more than 200% during the first quarter, and we've seen demand for these services remain elevated into Q2. Sam's Club delivered strong comp sales growth of over 16%, excluding fuel and tobacco. eCommerce sales grew 40% in the quarter with strong demand for direct-to-home delivery. Sam's experienced multiple weeks of significant and new member sign-ups. The Sam's app is also introducing more members to Scan & Go, which added 700,000 members in the quarter. Sam's Club also incurred incremental crisis-related operating costs of approximately $65 million. However, fuel income was up significantly and resulted in Sam's operating income increasing 9.5%. As you saw in our release today, we withdrew our FY '21 financial guidance. The decision to withdraw guidance reflects uncertainty around several key external variables and their potential impact on our business and the global economy, including the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 health crisis, the lengthened impact of stay-at-home orders, the scale and duration of economic stimulus, employment trends and consumer confidence. The uncertainty stems from some variables that could impact performance in either direction. Our business fundamentals are strong, our financial position is excellent, and I'm confident in our ability to perform well in almost any environment. While the short-term environment will be challenging, we're positioned well for long-term success in an increasingly omni world. We're seeing uplift from stimulus spending in the U.S. and expect that to continue through some part of Q2. So there are tailwinds that will help us gain customer loyalty and market share over this time. As mentioned throughout, we're also seeing significant headwinds and expect them to continue in the coming months. Some will be temporary, but others will persist through Q2 and possibly beyond. In the near term, we expect some operating income pressure, the extent of which depends on the balance of the tailwinds and the headwinds we just discussed. We currently expect the greater challenges on a relative basis to be in some of our international markets, where we have many of the same challenges as in the U.S., both greater pressure from government regulations and lesser degree to stimulus. We also anticipate significant top line headwinds from currency. If rates stay where they are today, the impact would be greater than $2 billion in Q2. Also earlier, Doug mentioned the decision to close the Jet operations. We don't anticipate a significant charge in Q2 as Jet is a component of our Walmart U.S. segment from both an operational and an accounting standpoint. The actions we're taking across the company are building associate and customer trust and should position us to capture in our incremental market share in the future. While we're adapting to the changing environment, our goals remain the same : we're focused on building the world's greatest omnichannel platform. We continue to position the business for the long term by leveraging unique assets, reducing friction in customers' lives and providing a strong value proposition with a commitment to EDLP. Walmart's people make the difference, and we will lead through this crisis. Before we move to our Q&A session, I want to remind you of the recent decisions we made for shareholders' week. We changed the format of our Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 3 to be a virtual-only event. We'll forgo in-person meetings with associates and shareholders, including the investment community events that would have been held in Northwest Arkansas during that week. I want to echo Doug's comments in saying we wish you and your families good health, and we look forward to a time where we can meet in person again. And with that, we would be happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : I think I'll target this towards Doug. Doug, the commentary on all the different phases you've gone through so far was great. Now we're -- the U.S. is now heading into kind of phased reopening and you guys have a lot of regional exposure. Can you give us a little more color on maybe what you're starting to see in the reopening phase? And also, just commentary on -- maybe more commentary on what you saw in China as you went through reopening. And maybe even weave into that, there was a big inflation spike in grocery in April. I think it was over 4%. Is that something that could be impacting Walmart U.S. business going forward? Any kind of thoughts on phase reopening would be great. Doug McMillon : Robbie, you did a great job of working in 3 or 4 questions into one question, I can see how this is going to go. I'll do my best. I think if I answer the U.S. question. As I look across sales every morning, it's been kind of surprising that, John, it's been more consistent than I would have guessed. I think the stimulus money is probably driven in the last few weeks, and at the end of the quarter, that consistency from geography to geography, but you can see some. In terms of what people are buying, I would also say there's consistency there. And John, when I get through, you may want to comment more on the U.S. In China, Robby, because of the way they approach things, I think the bounce back is going to be different and has been fairly strong there relative to what we'll see in the U.S. and other markets. I think we may see a bit of a 2-step in some places where we make progress, 2 steps forward, take a step back and then move forward again. Obviously, there are a lot of pieces that have to be put in place from testing to exposure notification. I think policies at state level and accounting level are going to influence this. And it'll be volatile and we'll just manage it. Job one for us right now in the U.S. is to get back in-stock and be positioned to serve customers for whatever it is that they want to buy. We have seen some inflation. And John, you may want to comment on that, too. Everybody knows about the cost inflation that happened in the protein categories. I think there may be some in others as well. We're going to try to keep our prices low. How we think about that, we wanted to deliver our customers the best value that we can while managing our bottom line and that's what we'll do as we look forward. John, do you want to add anything? John Furner : Sure. As Doug said, Robby, there were some phases that happened from the beginning of March until the end of the quarter. And really what we saw after the Easter holiday is things did become more stable, mix normalized to a point given the stimulus money that's in the market and things have been relatively consistent across the box and the channel since that point. So to your question, the phases have been quite fine, but they seem to be more stable over the last few weeks. The second part of the question, as you said, was reopening and we will be managing the business geographically, state to state, city to city. And over the next few weeks, we'll be reopening some of the services in the areas we believe it's safe for our associates and customers for us to operate in those services, would be things like our tire and service centers, our auto care centers and our optical centers. So we're doing those. We're reopening a few of those in limited spots this week to learn how to best get that service back to our customers. And then the third part of the question was inflation. We have seen some inflation in categories like milk eggs and dairy later in the quarter. That seems to have subsided somewhat. And then protein inflation has picked up over the last few weeks as plants have been inoperable in certain parts of the country. And as those have gotten back to limited operating capacities, we'll continue to moderate that. But fortunately, with the Walmart merchandising team, merchandising team is a very qualified team, and they will be able to do a number of things to help customers in any way possible to maintain values in the stores. And then finally, maintain margins appropriately as we move through the rest of the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : So I wanted to talk a little bit about eCommerce. Doug, you mentioned the strength that you've seen. And I think the number you said is a fourfold increase since mid-March. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the demographics are of the new customers that you're attracting? And then wondering if you could give a little color on what the repeat rate is on some of these new customers? And then I guess just bigger picture, given the meaningful acceleration in eCom, how does this growth kind of shift, a shift to eCom change, your outlook for the business in terms of priorities and investments? Any color there would be great. Doug McMillon : Yes. I'll kick it off, and then Marc and John may want to add as well. Karen, it's been great to see how the teams responded to the additional volume. I mean, it was a big uptick and it took a bit of time for us to get on our feet. I was in an eCommerce fulfillment center in Fort Worth, Texas a few weeks ago. We finished after Christmas with 1,000 associates in that facility and the day that I was there, we had 4,000. So the surge just in throughput is amazing. And the stores have been acting as fulfillment centers, as I mentioned in my comments. I think the 4x number you're referring to was specifically related to our pickup and delivery business at store level and how many new customers have picked it up. And John, I think we've seen indications already that they are repeating. And as our performance got better with in-stock, I think our ability to deliver a strong NPS score there is going to be an indication that we should be able to retain them. I don't have any information about their demographics. I don't know, John, if you or Marc do. But why don't I turn to the 2 of you and let you add some color to what I've said already. Marc, do you want to go first? Marc Lore : Sure. Sure, Doug. And just to build on what you said there, we have seen an increase in not only new buyers, but also repeat rates across the board, both for pickup, delivery from the store and delivery out of the AFB. So feeling really good about what we're seeing here. And we're using this as an opportunity to build a healthier underlying eCom business as well. John Furner : The only other thing I would add, Karen, we have seen higher growth rates amongst customers who are 50 years of age or older than what we had seen in previous quarters. Other than that, it's been across the board. The repeat rate has been higher. And I think it's a real strength of the organization to be able to enlist so many stores to help fulfill like we did in the quarter. I think only Walmart could turn on 2,500 stores to fulfilling customer orders as quickly as we did. So I'd just like to thank our team for being able to do that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : And kudos to the team for such strong execution through this crisis. Brett, you managed margins very well in 1Q. Perhaps discuss what really stood out to you and the team, given the dynamic situation. And while it's certainly understandable to suspend guidance, if you could, maybe just comment on some of the factors that we should keep in mind, whether it's in terms of pay and benefits and margin impact of ongoing panel mix shift. Anything along those lines that we should factor in as we do our best to model going forward. Brett Biggs : Yes. Thanks, Paul. I'll kick-off. And John, you may want to chime in a little bit on margins. Coming into the quarter, and even as we gave guidance in February, we certainly knew of the price investments that we've made last year, and we were going to have some overlap with those price investments. So that was already baked into the guidance we gave at the start of the year. So that was as we expected. Obviously, there were changes in the mix, particularly in Walmart U.S., much heavier in food and consumables, less so in general merchandise, until the end of the quarter when general merchandise got stronger and helped some with that mix. Also changes in shift to eCommerce. As you saw, our eCommerce growth is very healthy. And we also lowered losses in eCommerce. We continue to see better mix within the eCommerce brand, our eCommerce segment. We also had our auto centers and vision centers that were closed down for a part of the quarter, and that was an impact on margins as well, which is something certainly we couldn't have anticipated going into the quarter. Paul, one thing we've talked about over time was that gross margins would somewhat go towards the market and customers would allow them to be and that we had to get expenses in the right place to ensure that we keep our operating margin where we want it to be and that played out in a much more accelerated way in this quarter. But we continue to manage expenses really well. We're being disciplined where we need to be disciplined and that allows us to continue to lean in where we need to lean in. So I'm really proud of the balance that we're able to keep in the quarter. There'll be timing elements to all of this as we'll have periods of time where expenses increase more quickly than others. We just announced the second round of special bonuses in the U.S., which you would have seen. So that will have an impact in Q2 and we're glad that we're able to do that.  From a guidance perspective, there was so much that we took into consideration, Paul, as you would imagine. And as I listed out the variables of what the different elements that we're seeing in the economy right now, so what's going to be the severity and the duration of this disease? What's the length of the stay-at-home orders that will continue? What's the stimulus that we'll see in the U.S. and other parts of the world? Employment conditions? And all of these things could be better than one anticipates in a quarter, can be less than one anticipates -- or a little bit more challenging than one anticipates in a quarter, and it's all of these things that we factored in and decide it was prudent to not give guidance at this time. But those are the things that we'll be looking at as we think about how the rest of the year looks and what you should be looking at as well. John, I don't know if you want to say any more on margins. John Furner : And the only thing I would add, Paul, is late in the quarter, post-Easter, as stimulus money got into the market, there was more of a balance between general merchandise and the rest of the box. As Brett mentioned, apparel was down 14% in the quarter. That actually turned back to positive late in the quarter. And then the second thing I would add, in addition to Brett mentioning services reopening, would be the contributed profit margin rates in eCommerce. We had better mix on eCommerce with home and general merchandise selling faster as people began to stay at home in the middle of the second quarter. Doug McMillon : I think one of the things we've been saying all along is we need a bigger online business in profitable categories. And Marc and the team have obviously been working on that. But you'll remember, in the fourth quarter, it was one of the points that we emphasized. Now if you look at what's happened in the first quarter, we've seen some traction there. Marc, it's also great to see that the marketplace has grown faster. So some of the things we were trying to get done over a period of time have accelerated as a result of what's happened during this period. But there are still other things, Paul, I'd be keeping an eye on. At the end of this, it's about a really healthy top line with a strong mix represented, not just consumable items at low margin delivered through any means they want, through our stores, if that's the most efficient route; straight from FCs, if that's the most efficient route. And that's the math that we work with underneath. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My question is, how does this growth, particularly in eCommerce, shape the outlook for your business? You've done a great job balancing investment with growth and still providing some margin upside. Is that still possible? And does it make sense to lean in some more here? Doug McMillon : I think we're being -- our mindset is an aggressive mindset, meaning that, Simeon, we want to drive this eCommerce business and the marketplace that goes with it as aggressively as we can. And Marc, you can chime in here as well. But we had a growth in terms of capacity and capital to build out our fulfillment centers. We have a multiyear plan there, and that will continue. It's been great to see the stores step up during a period like this to handle surges. That capability is one that serves us well over time. And we -- I think with the membership plan that we have, some of the things we spoke about in New York, we're positioned to play offense as we go through the summer and into the end of the year. And even as the virus and other things create volatility, we'll keep moving forward on our strategy. The 5 priorities that I mentioned earlier are the ones I think will persist through the year and we'll keep driving the long term while we're managing the short term. Marc, do you want to add anything? Marc Lore : Yes. No, I'll just build on that, Doug, and just say that we continue to leverage our unique assets in ways that only Walmart can with same-day delivery out of the supercenter. But as you said, Doug, also leveraging the 2,500 stores to do fulfillment to take up some of the excess capacity that we needed and didn't have in the fulfillment centers. So in addition, I would say the continued investment in marketplace, as that's accelerating faster than the overall first-party business. We continue to attract new dollars at this time. And then WSS, it's also very early, but we're seeing very encouraging times. It's opening up the business that we sell in, and we've seen that as a potentially nice growth there in the future. Brett Biggs : Simeon, this is Brett. I would add on a little bit, too, that we've talked about probably every quarter how this team spends a lot of its time thinking about how we pull the different levers inside this company. There's so many levers that we can pull to make the P&L work, and I think you've seen that, certainly some in Q1. And the ability, I'm always reminded, but the ability of this company to move with agility and with speed is pretty amazing. And I think you've seen that in this quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : You mentioned in your prepared comments the carryover of price investments. How should we think about price investments going forward? I know back at the Investor Day, that was something that you were talking about with regards to the general merchandise category more. Just how should we think about that in the context of what's occurred in 2020? John Furner : Kate, this is John. Our first priority right now is to get the stores back in stock. All across the company, we've had unprecedented demand in a number of categories. And at the current time, our focus is to get our inventory levels back to a level that we can serve customers all across the country each and every day. We do have -- we have in our plan still price investments planned later in the year. However, due to the changes and everything we've gone through so far this year, we'll be taking those decisions later in the year and we'll make that decision at the right time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : I guess, Brett, probably for you. How should we be thinking about the incremental COVID costs, I guess, in the second quarter? You have the $900 million in the first. I know there's a lot of uncertainty here. But just can you help us think about maybe what level of underlying operating expenses being just added to the business that probably persists beyond any onetime bonus payments and those types of things? Just how we should be thinking about that. Brett Biggs : Yes, Peter. Appreciate it. So the $900 million in incremental costs in the first quarter, about 3/4 of that was related to additional associate pay or benefits, and you would have seen the announcements. So as you would have seen, we've already announced a second round of special bonuses in the U.S., which that financially will hit in the second quarter. There's going to be some expenses that carry on probably for quite some time, additional sanitation, cleaning in the stores. As John said, we're going to make sure we're in stock and we have the people to get everything out on the floor. So some of those expenses will certainly carry through the second quarter and likely some of that will continue past that. So if you look at the bonus we just paid in the second quarter, that gets you more than 1/3 of the way to the total costs we were in, in Q1. So if the costs were in that ballpark again in Q2, I think that would probably be a fairly reasonable assumption at this point. Operator : The next question is from the line of Robert Drbul with Guggenheim. Robert Drbul : Just 2 quick questions really. The first one is, I think you talked that marketplace growth outpaced eCommerce. I was wondering if you could put a dollar number on that.  And then the second question is, could you just address a little bit more how the supply chain is working for you guys and sort of the flow-through that you're seeing from vendors to the stores? That would be very helpful. Doug McMillon : Marc, do you want to take marketplace first? Marc Lore : Yes. No, as we've said before, marketplace continues to outpace growth of first-party business. We've definitely made some move through the current marketplace during this period with pressure on the supply chain. And some of the things that we've learned there, I think, is going to be helpful to keep that business healthy going forward. John Furner : And on the supply chain, for the most part, the actual supply chain within Walmart has stayed relatively current other than a couple of exceptions in the first quarter. Some of our longer lead time general merchandise categories where you have out-of-stocks will take a bit longer to recover probably into June and July, particularly in general merchandise. Our food business is mostly current with the exception of some areas in the protein categories, and those are week-to-week as we monitor what's going on around the country. Doug McMillon : Bob, this is Doug. I would just add that the collaboration between our suppliers and our team has been really strong. Really appreciate the merchants, the replenishment team, not only in the U.S. but around the world. I think the communication has been terrific. I've personally been involved in some of that communication. The CEOs and the leaders of our suppliers have kept us up to speed on what they're dealing with. They don't only try to keep their people safe throughout their supply chain, but think about the suppliers that they have into the supply they bring to us. There's just a lot of steps to this. And I think it's been impressive how people have responded. Operator : Next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Wanted to just also ask about eCommerce. It sounds like all different modes there really accelerated. But any color you can help us think about how this acceleration impacts the time line of improvement in eCommerce losses? And associated with that, the decision to use the stores for fulfillment. Were the FCs stretched there in capacity? Or was that more of a labor-driven decision? And I guess, do we -- should we be thinking about any need for additional FC capacity in the coming years? Doug McMillon : Yes. Marc, I'll kick things off and then toss it over to you. I think our need for capacity has been one that we've been aware of. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a multiyear plan to grow it, and we'll do that and, in some cases, might pull things forward a bit, but I don't know that you would notice it. It did take time to recover because the demand popped to such a high level. And as I mentioned with the Fort Worth example, we had to hire a lot of people. One of the pieces of innovation that might go unnoticed here is that our team figured out how to hire people in a much shorter period of time, what would have taken us days and weeks was taking us hours and days, and that was also true for the eCommerce fulfillment centers. So the stores stepped in to help with excess capacity. So Marc, I think you can add anything you want to add to that. But as you do that, would you also, as it relates to the long-term profitability of the eCommerce, mention whether or not we've been able to add any new brands in this period of time to the assortment? Marc Lore : Yes, Doug. So yes, along the lines of a healthier business, there's a number of things that we've done during this period to create a healthy business coming out of it. Some of the things that we know we need to do long term to continue to do these losses is keep the fixed growing at a low rate when we grow sales at a high rate, driving mix into marketplace, which has been driving mix into higher-margin categories like home and fashion, which we're also doing. And that means that we needed to continue to add brands. This is a particularly good period of stretch for us where we've added a lot of really good brands. Some of them include Champion, for example, Keds, also Ray-Bans and a bunch of others. So we feel really good about extending this first-party long tail, increasing margin, driving better mix, keeping fixed in check. And then also, as Doug said, innovating and doing things like leveraging the stores to help with FC capacity. Doug McMillon : I think big picture, one way to think about it would be that we're going to sell a broad assortment across merchandise categories and services to customers. And we're going to do that as they come into our stores and clubs, as they utilize pickup on-site and as we deliver to their home and eventually into their home. And what we will do is design and execute a supply chain underneath that, that leverages all of our assets. So there'll be times when it makes sense for an order to go straight from an FC based on what that order is comprised of. There'll be other times where that may be split between stores and fulfillment centers. There are other times where it may flow completely through a store, maybe even John receiving something from a fulfillment center to a store joining our last-mile delivery, which I know you've been working on as we speak. So I think we just learned over time how to manage the cost underneath that top line demand. And we've got a lot of assets to use, a lot of flexibility to balance speed, expectations of service with cost. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Can you talk -- 2 questions. So first, on the gross margin, thinking about 2Q, would seem like your mix is shaping up to be much better. Maybe the surge in the business is not as onerous. And then on the apparel side, do you think you've taken a sufficient reserve and a stimulus surge clean you up sort of through midway mid-May? And then this second question is, I think the FDA raised SNAP payments in May and June, correct me if I'm wrong. And how do you think about that benefit? And I guess the offset would be some of the back-to-school pull forward in some of these electronics categories. John Furner : Let me take the first one on the gross margin mix. As we said, general merchandise and food were more level towards the end of the quarter. In apparel, we have stayed current on all of our markdowns and our inventory is in good position coming out of the quarter. So I don't see anything different than what we would have planned for. And could you repeat the last part of the question on the SNAP? Christopher Horvers : Yes. The second part was, I think the government raised SNAP payments in May and June to the tune of 40%. So wanted to think about how sizing that relative to some of the disclosures you've given in the past. And any thoughts also on how maybe some back-to-school pull forward could occur in the electronics category? Doug McMillon : Chris, this is Doug. We're all looking at each other. If the SNAP change has occurred, we're not aware of it. But it's a great example of the volatility that could very well be true. We're processing so much information, it may be that we're just not aware of that yet. I mean, when you think about guidance, Brett, there's upside, downside. We're just going to have to manage this thing week to week. And Chris, I would not attempt to forecast back-to-school right now. There's a reason we pulled guidance. We're telling you about the first quarter. We'll tell you about the second quarter later. Brett Biggs : Yes. I'd say the same thing, Chris, on gross margin, which is we've talked about that we've continued to see definitely some stimulus buying as we started the quarter. But if you just look back at the last 8 weeks, the variability in sales and mix over that period of time, I'd be cautious in trying to look at margin too far out. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Seth Sigman : And obviously, great results here in managing in the environment. My main question is around online grocery. And specific to delivery unlimited, what are you guys seeing in terms of subscriber growth right now? And what are you learning about where that offering can go? And then just overall, how are you managing capacity constraints for online grocery overall? John Furner : Seth, this is John. Across the quarter, as we said, demand was quite variable and very high at some points. We mentioned in our stock-up phase we had really high-volume levels in paper, groceries, surface cleaners, categories like that. And at some point -- at one point during there, we had to pull some demand down because we weren't able to build the orders due to in-stock. But quickly, we're able to recover that as we got into April. And we've continually been adding slots. So more customers could be served with our online pickup option. And as far as the delivery unlimited, really good growth in the number of people who are using the service all across the quarter. And expect more and more consumers around the country are going to be looking for delivery options. I think we're just -- we're fortunate to be positioned at Walmart in a way where we can deliver from store. We can have pickup orders ready. And we've included more and more general merchandise categories in our pickup assortment. We're now down to one application on the phone. One app still has 2 hallways, but we're down to one app on the phone, that went live as of this week. So we're positioned well to be able to serve customers the way they want to be served from fulfillment centers, from stores or from picking up in the stores. Doug McMillon : John mentioned 2 hallways. That refers to the fact that on our app, you can choose to do grocery pickup from the store or order from walmart.com. But over time, I think what John said about general merchandise matters, it's going to end up being that you can do kind of a really quick pickup or delivery from a store location, and it will be inclusive of general merchandise, which helps us with mix and also improves the [indiscernible]. So our language will probably evolve away from online grocery to just be pickup and delivery, and we'll talk to you more about what that means in the future. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Beth Reed Pricoli : This is actually Beth Reed on for Scot. I just had a question about the stock-up chip at Walmart. Understanding that drove the drop in transactions in the lift in basket size. Can you just discuss kind of why it looks like the opposite trend happened at Sam's? Doug McMillon : I think it could be related to metering going into the stores. There have been periods of time during the quarter where we work at stripping transactions at store level because of social distancing. In Sam's, we weren't using as much of the capacity of the building before this crisis as we were in the supercenters. So that may be contributing to it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Curious if you could frame or quantify for us the impact of out-of-stocks on sales in 1Q. Maybe where you would have liked to see your first quarter ending inventory? And where are you today, since I'm sure things are changing by the week? Any color you can share there. John Furner : So we ended the quarter about 8% down in inventory, so definitely lower than what we've anticipated. And that's not evenly spread around the box. So we've been lower in general merchandise categories like electronics, networking, laptops, bicycles, and those are some of the longer lead time categories where we saw a big shopping late in the quarter. Even categories like fishing really took off late in the month of April. So we'll be working the next couple of months, we think, end of June and July, to recover the inventory levels there. In food and consumables, we've seen some decent recovery in our paper good categories. Cleaning is still lower than what we'd intended. And then most of dry grocery has stabilized a bit, particularly late into the first quarter. Operator : We're nearing the end of our question-and-answer session. We have time for one final question, which is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Doug, looking out over the long run and given the structural changes that are likely to occur as a result of the pandemic, does this permanently increase the cost of doing business for Walmart from factors like additional protection for employees and customers and the mix to the digital business? And as part of that, one of your largest competitors have indicated it's going to spend $4 billion of profit. Does that put added pressure on the retail market to follow through and permanently put pressure on the profitability for other retailers? Doug McMillon : Mike, I think one of the embedded questions in what you just asked is, what approach will we take to testing for the virus? Some of those investment numbers that have been mentioned, I think, anticipate paying per test a fairly high number for a lot of people and a lot of tests. That's one of the areas that we are looking at. We've got a team involved in trying to sort out what kind of testing approach we're going to take, both diagnostic and antibody testing over time, as we all try to keep people safe. As you would know, there are a lot of moving parts there. There's actions from governments, federal and state. There are other players trying to sort all that out. So that's unclear to me. Setting that aside, I think the things that we've done in terms of PPE and operational processes, there's nothing extraordinary there that you wouldn't know about now that you've seen the first quarter number. As it relates to mix going forward, this is not really a new situation. The eCommerce, channel shift and merchandise mix issues have been on our minds, and we've been working towards creating a healthy mix for a futuristic business for quite some time. And you could see it in our fourth quarter numbers, what happened. And you can see it in what happened during the first quarter. When we have a strong eCommerce business in apparel and home and marketplace, it sure does help a lot. In the end, we're going to end up with an omnichannel business, and it's going to serve customers in the way that they want to be served. And we're going to figure out, and we are, as we speak and have been, what combination of choices we need to make from a supply chain point of view, where to route orders through, how much to pay people, all those variables that Brett mentioned, we've got a lot to work with to sort it out. I think job 1 for us is to stay relevant with the customer for the future and the way they want to shop. And then job 2 is to figure out how to deliver a shareholder return as we do it. And we were doing both of those things and will continue to in the future. So Dan, if that was the last question, did you mean I just wrap up and say thank you to everybody? Thanks giving me the nod on video conference. We do appreciate how much time and attention you all pay to Walmart, and we'll try to do a good job of communicating as we go forward and letting you can't -- letting you know what we can [indiscernible] and what is the very volatile situation. Really appreciate our associates. They've done an incredible job in the first quarter, and we all appreciate it.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Dan Binder. Please go ahead, Dan. Dan Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. I'm joined by a few members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you an update on the business and discuss second quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC, as well as risk and uncertainties resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our Web site at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : [Technical difficulty] and I want to thank our associates for rising to the occasion. They are adapting to changing customer needs and tackling new challenges while positioning our business for the future, and we are grateful. As I shared last quarter, we are operating with a clear set of priorities to guide our discussion-making through this crisis. Those priorities are, one, supporting our associates on the frontline in terms of their physical and financial well being; two, serving our customers as safely as possible and keeping our supply chain operating; three, helping others, which includes hiring so many that need work, supporting our suppliers and marketplace sellers and serving the communities where we operate, including accelerating our efforts to increase, fairness, racial equity, and justice; four, managing the business well operationally and financially in the short-term; and five, driving our strategy to strengthen our business for the long-term. First, our associates; they continue to be inspiring, and it has been a pleasure to visit with so many of them as I made my way around the country visiting stores, clubs, and distribution centers. During this call, last quarter, we outlined a number of measures we have in place to support them, and those continue. Globally, we have hired more than 500,000 new associates since the beginning of the year. We\u2019ve continued our COVID-19 emergency leave policy, which includes the removal of our tenant's requirements related to our quarterly cash bonus program called Myshare. That enables people to stay home if they are diagnosed with a virus, or feeling sick, need to care for others, or feeling uncomfortable working, and globally, this year we paid or announced $1.6 billion in Myshare and special cash bonuses to support our associates financially. After supporting our associates, our next priority is serving our customers. Consistent with our purpose, we remain committed to EDLP, ensuring the lowest prices on our basket of goods. During the second quarter, our customers were spending so much more time at home that we experienced strong sales in categories like TVs, computing, and connected home. Customers also took advantage of time for outdoor entertainment and sports, which led to strengthen those categories. With significant operating restrictions for restaurants across the country, families continue to prepare more meals at home, and our business has benefited from that trend. As you would expect, there continues to be extremely high demand for disinfectants, cleaning supplies, and paper goods. At times, we saw a return stock up behaviors in certain food and consumable categories in specific geographies, where hotspots occurred. While there is volatility in the supply chain levels, we are starting to see some categories recover in terms of in stock. From a seasonal standpoint, back-to-school was negatively impacted by health crisis in terms of timing and demand. We have been thoughtful in our approach both in stores and online, and we believe we are well-positioned whether students or teachers work from classrooms or their homes. The third priority for us has been to help others in the communities we serve. I am proud of the many ways we are supporting communities including our support for food banks. This quarter through our Fight Hunger Spot Change campaign and food donation program, we helped to provide access to an estimated 300 million meals for people in need. We are also continuing our support for communities through COVID-19 testing sites with more than 420 across 33 states. Communities across America have become rightly-focused on racial equity and justice, and so are we. Our work starts inside the company with our diversity inclusion efforts. In addition, we have also established a team to look for places where we can put our core business, and the size of our business to work to influence our nation\u2019s financial, healthcare, education, and criminal justice systems for good. In addition, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have launched a center for racial equity, committing $100 million to fund philanthropic initiatives that complement the company\u2019s efforts to shape the four systems I just mentioned. Even during this crisis, the team is managing our business well and executing our strategy to build omnichannel solutions globally. In the U.S., we continue to expand pickup and delivery services including express delivery with customers receiving their orders in well under two hours. In Mexico, we have now launched same-day delivery from 70% of Sam\u2019s Club, and in India, we launched Flipkart Wholesale, a business-to-business solution that will leverage our omnichannel capabilities to better serve kiranas and other small business as our cash and carry business joins Flipkart. There has been a lot of buzz recently about membership at Walmart. We have been testing membership with delivery on limited subscription since late last year. That customer offer was limited to a grocery and consumables delivery service as the reason to sign up. Since that launch, we have proven to ourselves that we can pick and deliver a broad set of categories across the super center not just food and consumables, but a wide assortment of general merchandize. We think that assort breath and our ability to deliver with speed nationally combined with a few other benefits for customers will result in a compelling proposition. So, we have been moving towards a new membership launch. We\u2019ll share more about that membership and timing when it\u2019s appropriate. As it relates to our Q2 performance, I\u2019ll begin with the Walmart U.S. segment. Comp sales were strong again this quarter at 9.3% excluding fuel. There were several tailwinds affecting our Q2 performance including government stimulus, more people eating at home, a focus by customers on entertaining themselves at home, and investing in their homes and yards. We also had some headwinds including reduced store hours and out of stocks. As the benefits from stimulus waned towards the end of the quarter, we saw our comp sales settle into a normal range. We are pleased with the progress we are making on walmart.com. We had really strong sales growth and significantly reduced losses. The tailwinds we are experiencing are accelerating our progress to build a healthier ecommerce business as we add new brands, improve product mix, growth the marketplace, and achieve more fixed cost leverage. The stores and online merchant teams are now integrated, and we believe we will benefit from that change going forward. The improvements in contribution profit and reduced operating losses are really good to see. We made several structural changes within Walmart U.S. during the quarter as we continue on our path to transform into an omnichannel organization. These changes were made to increase innovation, speed, and productivity. This is obviously a difficult time for these associates to experience changes like this. So, we are providing additional financial support and time to look for another role along with other forms of support to make that easier than it would otherwise be. Turning to Sam\u2019s Club where the team delivered comps of 17.2% including fuel and tobacco and grew membership income 7.8%. We saw improvements in member count, renewal rates, and plus member penetration. The popularity of Scan & Go is accelerating, which is great to see. The membership value proposition is strong, and the team is executing well. Walmart International sales increased 1.6% in constant currency, and seven of ten markets had positive comp sales. The team delivered good top line results given we faced significant headwinds from currency and the government mandated closure of Flipkart for about half the quarter, as well as parts of Africa and Central America for portions of the quarter. Canada, China, and Mexico lead the way as customers choose one stop shopping and omnichannel solutions. In India, Flipkart reopened in mid-May, after which we saw GMV exceeding pre COVID-19 levels, excluding fuel as this performance demonstrated the resilience of the business with growth in a challenging period. Profit for international was also better than we expected when you remove the effects of FX and a discrete tax item. I'll close today once again by thanking our associates for their incredible work. Our integrated omnichannel offering continues to resonate with customers around the globe. It's positioned the company well during this crisis, and we remain convinced it'll be the winning strategy going forward. I'd also like to mention that we'll be releasing our ESG report next week. I encourage all of you to spend time with report to better understand the incredible work our team is doing in this space. I wish you and your family's good health, and I'll now turn it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Let me start by thanking our associates for their fantastic work serving customers during this unusual time. Every day we are navigating through a broad set of challenges while positioning the company to win. I'm so proud of how the team has quickly adapted to new ways of working and respond to the changing needs of our customers. The health crisis continued to affect shopping behavior in the second quarter with trip consolidation and larger basket sizes in stores, as well as channel shifts toward eCommerce. Our results are a reminder that customers want multiple ways to shop with us, and we're innovating and leveraging our unique assets to provide solutions for them. Our financial position is very strong, and we remain laser-focused on operating efficiency even as we have incremental COVID-related costs to support associates and customers. We've maintained our strong cost culture and took recent steps to further streamline the organization to better support our U.S. omnichannel strategy. So let's get to Q2 results. Total constant currency revenue growth was strong of 7.5% to more than $140 billion despite operating limitations in some markets early in the quarter. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased more than 9%. International net sales grew nearly 2% in constant currency, and Scan & Go grew comp sales more than 17% excluding fuel and tobacco. Gross profit margin was strong in each segment and increased 63 basis points for the total company benefited by strong sales and higher margin general merchandise categories, which in the U.S. is aided by government stimulus, lower markdowns and better fuel margins. This was partially offset by the carryover price investments from last year. SG&A was negatively affected by approximately $1.5 billion in incremental COVID related costs, about 75% of which related to associate bonuses and expanded benefits, including the recently announced third special bonus of the year. The quarter was also impacted by U.S. business restructuring cost of about $380 million into discrete tax item. In total, these costs negatively affected expense leverage by about 130 basis points, and as a result expenses deleverage by 42 basis points. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis was up more than 18% and adjusted EPS increased about 23% to $1.56 versus last year's Q2 adjusted EPS. Currency fluctuations negatively affected EPS by about $0.02. Operating cash flow year-to-date increased nearly $8 billion versus last year. Free cash flow was up more than $9 billion with higher sales, lower inventory levels, continued operating discipline and lower CapEx some of which is timing. Inventory was down about 7% year-on-year mainly due to heightened demand. While we didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter, our capital allocation strategy is unchanged, and we continue to feel very good about the position of the company. Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. had a strong quarter. Comp sales excluding fuel increased 9.3% with eCommerce sales growth of 97%. eCommerce sales are strong throughout the quarter contributing approximately two-thirds of the segment comp growth. We saw significant increases in repeat rates and weekly active digital customers, and we continue to make progress on assortment expansion of seller tools with eCommerce marketplace sales growing triple-digits. For accelerating investments in omni fulfillment solutions, including the continued rollout of same day pickup and delivery services to more stores, expanding store pickup and delivery slots, but nearly 30% since February, and permanently increasing shift from store capabilities from pre-filming levels. The second quarter started strong as general merchandise categories had accelerating growth both in store and online as government stimulus funds were dispersed. As families spent more time at home, we saw strong increases in categories like home, sporting goods, landscaping, and electronics. Grocery sales had another strong quarter including robust growth in fresh. As stimulus funds tapered off toward the end of the quarter sales started to normalize, but July comps still grew more than 4%. Trip consolidation continued throughout the quarter, resulting in an average ticket increase of about 27% and a transaction decrease of about 14%. Gross profit rate was strong at 42 basis points due to increased sales and higher margin general merchandise categories and pure markdowns. We also saw improvements in eCommerce margin rates reflecting continued progress on product mix and faster growth and marketplace sales. The carryover of the last year's price investment and the temporary closures of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers negatively affected the margin rate. The approximate $1.2 billion of incremental COVID-related costs as well as the restructuring costs negatively affected the expense leverage by about a 170 basis points. As a result, the U.S. segment deleveraged 41 basis points. However, underlying productivity is strong both in physical stores and eCommerce operations. Adjusted operating income was up almost 17% for the quarter aided by significantly lower eCommerce losses. Inventory declined about 4.6%, reflecting strong sales and higher than normal out of stock in some categories. While we continue to make progress in our in-stock position, there are some specific areas that are still challenging. Overall, we're in a good position. As noted, throughout the market, the back-to-school season is off to a slower start than usual given the uncertainty around the timing of students, physically returning to school. As a result, we expect the season to be choppy and come later than normal. Items like laptops, tablets and home office furniture performing well, while others like basic school supplies, backpacks, and apparel are understandably soft. Despite the slow start to back-to-school, overall U.S. comps are a fairly normal range to sort of quarter. International results are better than anticipated coming into the quarter. Despite operational limitations in several markets due to the crisis, including the government mandated closure Flipkart, net sales increased 1.6% in constant currency including nearly 40% growth in eCommerce. Seven of 10 markets posted positive comp sales. Sales in Canada and China were exceptionally strong, and Mexico showed solid results. Excluding fuel, the comps were also solid with online grocery growing faster than the market. Customers are responding favorably at expanded eCommerce and omnichannel offerings driving triple-digit eCommerce sales growth in most of these markets year-over-year. We faced extensive government mandated closures in markets like India, South Africa, and Central America particularly early in the quarter. Flipkart operations were closed for around half the quarter, but since reopening in mid-May, GMV is exceeding pre-COVID levels. In Africa, about one-fourth of stores were closed for a portion of the quarter, and certain high-volume sales were restricted. In the U.K., decreases in travel pressured fuel sales. Currency fluctuations were significant headwind of sales of approximately $2.4 billion during the quarter. International operating income declined about 9% on a reported basis, but increased 11.5% on adjusted constant currency basis, excluding the previously-announced discrete tax item. During these challenging times, we continue to execute the strategy of building strong local businesses powered by Walmart and announced additional investments in China, India focused on positioning the portfolio for growth. For example, we're excited about the launch of Flipkart wholesale, creating a B2B marketplace to help small businesses in India source directly for manufacturers and producers. We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to strengthen our position across the portfolio. Sam's Club had another terrific quarter with strong comp sales growth of 17.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco with positive contributions for both increased transactions and average ticket. ECommerce sales grew 39%, with strong demand for direct-to-home delivery. The business showed broad strength across categories including food consumables, which were particularly strong, and our member smart brand also performed well. The sales strength reflected strong member growth and benefits from government stimulus. We're pleased with the strong membership trends of Sam's. Membership income grew 7.8% Q2, the best quarterly performance in more than five years. New member signups and renewal rates were very strong and plus member penetration was at a historically high-level. Sam's also incurred incremental COVID-related expenses. However, the approximate $100 million of additional costs was more than offset by strong gross margin, which resulted in Sam's operating income increasing more than 24% excluding fuel. Consistent with our first quarter release, we aren't providing FY 2021 financial guidance due to continued uncertainty around key external variables related to the health crisis and their potential impact on our business and the global economy. The health crisis has created tailwind both tailwinds and headwinds to our business. In Q2, we saw stronger than expected sales due in large part stock buying and stimulus spending, but the duration extent of future government stimulus remains uncertain. In Q2, stimulus spending improved our sales mix, and in turn, gross margin and operating profit. We've also managed the greater operational complexities incurred incremental costs to ensure associate and customer safety and some of those will continue. Currency headwinds also remain quite strong. If rates stay where they are today, the top line impact would be more than $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Despite the various challenges, our strong performance throughout the dynamic and challenging first-half of the year reinforces the strength of this business and the omni channel strategy we're leading. Walmart's financial position remains excellent, allowing us to position the company for success now and in the future. Thank you for your interest in Walmart and we would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much. I want to focus on eCom growth a little bit. So, wondering, first, if you could just give an update on the customer mix and where you think you're gaining share, and I did ask this last quarter, but I'm obviously very interested in terms of the demographics, and then, wanted to get a little more granularity on the attachment rates on general merchandize given the consolidation of the app, and then, the last part of that was, if you could give any more color on marketplace, obviously you called out triple-digit growth on that, maybe anything you could provide in terms of number of sellers, number of SKUs, or any more granularity would be helpful. John Furner : Hi, Karen. It's John Furner. Good morning. Thanks for the question. As we said, eCommerce up 97% in the quarter, and we are excited by new customers that have joined and retention rates, and I think we've also been pleased to see the improvement and mix in categories that are selling online, which ties a bit to your second question. We've had stronger growth rates in both home and apparel online, which also, home has been strong in the stores as customers moved into their homes and a set of offices and now beginning to have school from home. Those have all been strong businesses, and then the third point that you made, marketplace, which is a very important part of the strategy also performed well in the quarter. In addition, marketplace, we've been opening up new supplier seller tools I should say, and including, which is now a small business, but our Walmart Fulfillment Service business is up and running, and we're excited by the prospect that it brings as well. So, again, the team did a nice job in the quarter reacting to customer's changes and trends. More and more customers are buying from Walmart Online, and we're happy to see the new customer segments and the retention rates. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Thank you, and good morning, and congrats on a strong second quarter. Brett, you spoke to back-to-school shopping being negatively impacted, but all that's going on, but comps in a normal range. Just any additional color you can provide on what you're seeing -- to-date or at least maybe any other puts and takes that we should be factoring in as we think about how to model the third quarter? And Doug, you know, most Americans shop at Walmart in some form each year, and the company has always had this like everyday low-price model. So, maybe just help us understand big picture, what a membership program can achieve for the consumer as well as for the company? Thank you. Brett Biggs : Hey, thanks, Paul. This is Brett. I\u2019ll start. As we pointed out, we're not giving guidance for the rest of the year, and as you can imagine with the various puts and takes that we've seen for the last five months, that certainly led to that decision, and there's things that in the second quarter some things that helped the business, certainly stimulus is one of those, and some things that were headwinds to the business, and we know, we're going to continue to see headwinds and tailwinds in Q3 and in the back-half of the year, and so, the balance of those and the timing of those makes it really challenging to try to put guidance up for a longer period of time, and that's why we didn't do that. We talked about back-to-school, it's just slower than it'd normally be, but that's understandable, given what's going on with students and how quickly they'll get back into classrooms, and so, we're just not talking much past that just given everything that's going on right now. Doug McMillon : I would just chime in on back-to-school, and say that it's just one component of the quarter, and we'll have to sort out how customers want to shop as we go, but we think our inventory is well-positioned, and we'll just react location-by-location. I don't think we got a lot of liability exposure there. The sales exposure will be mixed as we go through the quarter, and manage other parts of our business. As it relates to the question about membership, Paul, I think from a customer point of view, they'll continue to get everyday low price. So, continue to get the broad assortment that we sell in the stores and increasing assortment online, but the reason that they would want a membership is because of the increased levels of service that we can provide, and it kind of starts out with a thread being about pick up and delivery, and if you want delivery from Walmart frequently, it's just more efficient for the customer to buy it in bulk, and that takes the form of an annual membership, and then, we'll add some things to it beyond just delivery. So that it's really more of a membership and a relationship. Building repeat is going to be an important aspect for the company to focus on. We\u2019ll also get the benefits of data, and learn how to serve customers more effectively in time as that membership grows. So, I think in a nutshell for the customer, it relates to experience. Then we keep talking about how omnichannel is a winning strategy, and what we really mean by that, I think is the customer is ultimately in charge. We are going to be flexible. We're going to have multiple ways to serve them, and those families will decide in that moment how they want to shop, and sometimes they'll be in the store, and sometimes they'll do pickup, and sometimes they'll do delivery, and many of them will buy membership, and when they do, they'll get benefits from that, and we'll make sure we manage that in a way where we're able to still keep our shelf prices low and offer EDLP to customers that really need that value, and are focused on opening price points, and we will manage the P&L in a way that prevents any kind of risk with that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good morning. I have two topics, my first also on membership and the second on Flipkart. On terms of membership, Doug, I don't know if there's any more detail you can share in terms of how you plan to differentiate the offer, you mentioned that you're going to add some features, and is there any indication of interest from work that you've done, and then how it fits into profitable growth, if that relationship can be maintained? And then on the second topic of Flipkart, right, there was a valuation on the quarter, I think it was a little less than what the market was expecting, so can you talk about the performance of it, and what's the proper read that we should take away from the latest round of financing? Doug McMillon : Yes, this is Doug. Simeon, I\u2019ll take Flipkart first, and then John, you can chime in on membership more. As it relates to Flipkart, Simeon, I think we're really pleased with how this whole thing has gone since we made the investment and the teams managed this environment, the COVID-19 environment in a really effective way, and it was nice to see once the government restrictions started to get lifted, how the volume came back, and we're staying close to the decisions that they're making, and excited about the strategy going forward, and with the investment, just wanted to make sure that they've got enough room, enough cash to operate. This is a time when there's so much of an opportunity that the size of the price in India is significant. We want to make sure that we're on our front foot being aggressive. So, we're not really getting hung-up on the valuation in the short-term. Over time, I think everybody will understand just how valuable that business in India is, whether it's the Flipkart portion or the PhonePe portion. Brett Biggs : And Simeon, first good morning, and thanks for the question on membership. It\u2019s important that we first acknowledge our strength in the entire businesses offering a wide assortment of everyday low price products across multiple channels, and that won't change, what we're thinking through with membership, as Doug said, is how to remove friction from customers lives and make it easier to access those assortments at everyday low prices throughout the multiple channels, so we don't have too much else to offer this morning, other than to say that, in addition to the delivery component, which we've tested now for since last year with the program called Delivery Unlimited, we're confident that that's a great base of an offer, and we'll have more to offer when we're ready to come out and talk about it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Recognizing that you have everyday low-price strategy and some of your competitors within the grocery category have a high lower promotional strategy and the promotions were less intense for them this quarter. Your grocery sales were up high single-digits, Fresh was probably better, but a lot of your competitors reported mid-teens or better comps during the period. So, do you think you lost market share in this important category on a unit basis, and why was that the case? John Furner : Hey, Michael, it's John. Now first, I'd say we were up high single digits for the quarter, and that equates to sales growth of about $3 billion and for the year we're somewhere around just over $8 billion sales growth in grocery for the year. So, pretty big dollar gains for the year. We did keep our prices at the levels they were throughout the entire quarter. So, being an everyday low-price retailer, we have seen average unit retails that have resulted in wide price gaps and even wider price gaps in the second quarter than we saw in the first quarter. So that's probably an important point determining the two differences. Then a couple of things that we\u2019re focused on, the rent headwinds that are ours to deal with, and one is we've had a significant level of in-stock issues that happened late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter but we do think that our inventory levels are now normalizing, we do still have pockets of in-stock issues that are both related to the supply chain and then other factors that have been caused by the pandemic. Then the last thing that we're doing, we now have 4,100 stores that have shifted from 8 :30 PM closing to 10 PM closing, but we do think that was a factor especially during the summer months, as the days got later, but if you look at the entire business, the real positive is in total, we believe Walmart did gain share, general merchandise was very strong and look like the share gains there did make up for anything that could have been lost in food, but the data it\u2019s a lot to work through, and we'll be reacting to the situation as time goes and we'll be able to tell a little bit farther out, how this really turns out, but overall, just really proud of the way the team has responded to such an intense change in the way people have been shopping and we had big sales spikes late in Q1, and early Q2 and the team have done a great job reacting to that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wondered if we could get a little bit more detail behind your commentary around the eCommerce losses improving during the quarter, was the biggest driver of that mix driven and what other improvements did you see within those losses were there that you would expect to continue into the second-half of this year? John Furner : Hi, Kate, it\u2019s John. There are few things that affected the business first, the sales growth is always helpful because you gain leverage on fixed costs anytime, you have growth rates really any meaningful percentage but 97% effectively doubling the business helps to leverage. The second thing that has helped is what we call contributed profit rate, CP. Our CP benefits have come from a number of factors, one factor being the mix of sales, we\u2019ve been stronger in home and apparel than we\u2019re in the rest of the business which are higher CP categories, the second our marketplace business has been strong which is also an accretive category in relation to the rest of the business. And then the third thing, we're excited about the way of working, the two merchandise and supply chain teams have come together and now we have merchants and people in supply chain here responsible for businesses across all of the channels. So, Walmart as a business should be able to gain continued leverage from those but leveraging a fixed, improve CP rates and CP rates coming from both leverage and from mix all contributed to lower losses in the quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I do want to follow-up on the online business. Two parts here; one, I think somebody mentioned repeat rates. If you could just elaborate on that whether you're seeing that more in online grocery, or general merchandize or possibly both online, just thought to get a little bit more color on that and then the second part of it around profitability, the improvement in losses you just talked about, is there anything that you mentioned there that's unique to this quarter whether it's the volume or the mix or the marketplace growth or should we be thinking about for this trend of improving losses to continue? Thank you. John Furner : Yes, I said, a few things on repeat rates. First, online grocery you asked about - we've traditionally had a high repeat rate and a high number of customers who are loyal in the channel, and that hasn't changed, and at the end of the first quarter, we had to reduce the number of slots due to inventory level, and then over the second quarter, we got slots not only back to where they were, but pick up slots up about 30%. So that's a strong part of the business and continues to grow online. In your very traditional direct to home orders, we have new customers and we have customers who are buying more. So, there are positives there. As far as if there is anything related to this. The second quarter that's anomaly I think it's too early to tell as we said, we're not able to forecast or provide guidance beyond what has already happened in the second quarter, certainly strong businesses and home where people were moving home and building home offices and buying office equipment yet to be determined of how long that trend could continue, but there are other areas within the eCom business that are also strong and everywhere that we see headwinds. We also see tailwind, so we'll just have to sort those out over the next couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get maybe expand a little bit on the on the health care strategy, kind of where that sits right now. There has been some changes, which is maybe helpful to understand where you are today and where you're taking that effort? Thanks. John Furner : Hi, Peter, this is John. We're really committed to healthcare. I don't think we'd have any change in strategy that we would talk about at this point other than say that we were appreciative of the work that Sean did while he was here at Walmart, and he was here about two years and he wanted to get some clinics open and get started, which he did and did a great job. We now have clinics in Georgia, Arkansas, moving into the Florida market, and then later in the year, we've also announced a couple clinics that will go into Chicago. So, for Americans, who are looking for high quality access -- access, high quality care at an affordable very transparent price, Walmart will be a great solution for consumers and we remain committed to the healthcare space. Doug McMillon : Hi, Peter, this is Doug, I'll just add that. We recently opened another clinic not far from Bentonville, Elm Springs and it's a smaller clinic than the one that some of you have seen in Dallas, Georgia, and I think it's an example of us, trying to figure out how many sizes we need with this square footage needs to be the equipment, investment, all those kinds of things. So, we're playing around with it as you would expect, and it's been interesting to watch how customers are interacting with that experience during the COVID-19 environment. The team has done a great job and the medical doctor and the other professionals in the clinic of keeping people safe, and demand is still strong in an environment where people are not necessarily taking advantage of a lot of preventative care. So, it's really -- I think interesting and exciting for us to try and figure this out, and even during this COVID-19 period of time, we're learning and figuring it out. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Bob Drbul : Good morning. I guess just you gave me some commentary around back-to-school being a little slow right now. Just wondered if you could maybe take a step back and give us some thoughts on where you think the consumer is, what do you think the economy is, and I guess most importantly, when you think about the holiday season, you have to plan a little early, if you might give us some color about the holiday season and sort of how you're really thinking about it at this point in time? Thanks Doug McMillon : Bob, I\u2019ll go first. This is Doug. It's obvious to say this, but there is just a lot of uncertainty right now, and so, much variance in how customers are feeling about their situation, and this decision that the government's got to make about Phase 4, investments is an important one, and I think it's really important as it relates to small business, in this economy in this country are driven so much by small and medium sized businesses that we want to see something happen there that will help support those folks. I think though, the larger companies are getting things sorted out and the government's paying attention to the larger companies that need some sort of financial support, but it's that small business group that in particular, I think we all need to keep our eye on and we'll probably determine just what this economy looks like on the other side of the face for stimulus. John Furner : And I think, Bob, I'd also add. Definitely, we see a number of consumers, who are feeling better about their personal finances, but the sentiment is a little lower than a year ago, and then we are also thinking about the number of consumers, who are thinking about job security and other opportunities. I think, in general, people perceive they're spending more money on food, despite eating out less, and so I think with the consumer will be thoughtful about the way we plan the rest of the year and we'll be very adaptive and react to changes and the trends that we see from our shoppers. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks, guys. One key question on the costs incurred in the first quarter, you said it was $900 million of incremental COVID costs, is that right number for this quarter, the 1.2 and anything you could give us in terms of the breakdown of that on sanitation versus labor costs, and what you think might persist into the third quarter and fourth quarter? Thanks. John Furner : Yes, thanks, Greg. So, the $900 million in the first quarter would be equivalent to the $1.5 million, and the second quarter $1 billion, sorry, the $1.2 billion, which is Walmart U.S. only, about 75% of those costs are related to bonuses, payroll benefits, and the like for associates. Those are about quarter of that. That's related to cleaning and sanitation and other things inside the store. They're certainly going to be some part of that, that continues the rest of the year and potentially I would think in the next year as well, so our ability to continue to be thoughtful about it, but safety of our customers and our associates are just number one on our mind as we take on those costs. So, it's obviously something that we're going to do going forward. The bonus -- the number in total is a little higher than last quarter, the second quarter or the last bonus, the third bonus that we announced -- was a crew for the second quarter so that that got picked up. So that'd be one additional bonus versus what you would have seen in Q1 and that's the main difference. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen. Oliver Chen : Hi, thank you. All the momentum and curbside, would love your thoughts and what you see ahead with automation and profitability, and also as you look at your customer insights and data, what are your thoughts about the customer type that would use curbside versus delivery and how that may manifest over time? John Furner : Hi, Oliver. The question on automation all is well, I'll start with. First, we have been working on a couple pilots where we're able to say automate, but really increase the amount of picks we're able to deliver from a store. We've got a store in New Hampshire with a system called Alert that does our grocery picking and has this with everything right up to dispensing, and we'll be expanding that pilot into Texas over the next few months. So I think mostly we're optimistic about the number of orders we'll be able to fill from these sorts of installation going forward, and then as far as the customer who is picking up today, and whether they're interested in delivery, and I think what we learned from delivery unlimited is that there are a wide range of people who appreciate delivery and are looking for ways to be able to buy delivery and pay for it in a way as Doug said, it's in bulk. So I think it's largely the same customer now. Well, of course learn more as time goes on, but Americans all over the country are looking for convenience and with Walmart's everyday low price plus a convenient delivery fee we see a lot of customers who are interested in this type of service. Doug McMillon : It's also been nice to see the Scan & Go team get curbside rolled out so quickly, and I think when small business comes back online, we're well-suited to serve bigger transactions from them that currently, the restaurants being closed aren't happening as much as they will after the pandemics over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to ask with so much discussion about membership and the potential there with Walmart with delivery unlimited or down the road with what may evolve into Walmart Plus, I was just surprised to see the headlines about the test with Instacart. So, I was wondering if you could just help elaborate on the thought process there. John Furner : Yes, hi, Kelly, good morning. We are excited about the prospect of customers being able to access products and prices at Walmart any way they choose and including deliveries you said, and then the specific question on Instacart. It is a test in California, and then one market in Oklahoma, and what we're hoping to learn is a combination of those to reinforce the value proposition that Walmart has to offer. Certainly, it's early, it's only been about a week. So really no read or anything to report on at this point, but we're looking forward to learning about the data as it comes in. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a few mostly kind of follow-ups, just first on July, any color on the gross margin performance in July, and then as it relates to holiday and just kind of curious early thoughts on the current environment, what we should expect sort of consumer behavior, you know, and how are you preparing to win in a shopping environment that probably will be different than anything we've seen historically? John Furner : Hi, Edward, on the margin, we don't break out by month, but across the quarter, the results are of course in a really stronger mix, and then fewer markdowns as a result of higher salaries and general merchandise, and then as far as the holiday season, its August now, and we're in the midst of the beginning of back-to-school. So we're carefully thinking through each of the different holidays and how they may change as a result of what's happening, but even like with schools, we're still learning day-to-day, which schools are open or planning to open, and I think everyone in the holidays that will be experienced over the next couple months will have to decide as we get closer so. The team is really working on plans and contingency plans and making sure that we are ready for the customer any way they want to shop, they've shifted purchasing online, you can see that in our online results of 97% and with the growth of pickup, we'll make sure that we're ready with both of these types of fulfilment options in addition to store shopping, so however the customer wants to shop will be ready. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Actually, I did want to follow-up on something that came up earlier, the call on the grocery business, I think the second quarter by no food was up high single-digits, but the overall grocery business was up mid-single-digits, and I know you guys referenced some out of stock issues, but that was a kind of a challenge across the industry. So we kind of take a step back. I mean, it looks like a lot of your competitors ran in the high teens, and so that's a pretty big difference, and I was wondering if you can maybe revisit that again and say what you twirls that big delta, between you and some of your grocery competitors? John Furner : Yes, Scott this is John again. As I said earlier, we were high single-digits in the food category, stronger comps and general merchandise, and the growth in the quarter in food was about $3 billion in sales, and what we're really focused on is the change in the number of stock up trips, which you've had a pretty big increase in the average ticket, and then internally, what we're working through as I said earlier, we've now got over 4000 of our stores back open until 10 p.m. We think that had an impact, and then again early in the quarter coming out of the first quarter, we dealt with a number of issues with our stocks and Walmart has been improving over the years, its ability to run a very lean and efficient supply chain and with the spikes in sales early -- or late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter. Those had a disproportionate effect on our business because of our stocks, but for the most part I'm feeling much better about normalized inventory levels in our recovery, and now we'll just work through different categories and issues we have a supply chain not been able to fill at the right time, but in general, the inventory levels are coming back into a more normalized position. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Hi, thanks a lot. Can you guys just unpack the ticket versus traffic dynamic throughout the quarter? And I guess I'm curious, was a slowdown in July and mostly ticket, and then when you look ahead to 2021 how you're thinking about lapping these great results, and then the final question would be if you guys could elaborate on Walmart fulfillment services? Thanks. John Furner : Yes. Good morning, Chuck. The question on lapping next year, we're working on the month of August. Chuck Grom : [Indiscernible] if you could please tell us what's going to happen in 2021, we would appreciate it. Brett Biggs : That's right, that's right, and so, we are just constantly reevaluating, evaluating how to dynamically make sure that we are staying ahead where the customer is and what the customer needs from us. Back to what was your first question again? Chuck Grom : Traffic. Brett Biggs : Traffic ticket, yes, traffic was -- we again, we don't breakup the months for the quarter, but you saw the quarter number down 14, then stock up trips are up. So customers are coming less often, but they're buying a lot more while they're there, and the combination of those two factors are what resulted in the 93 comps, so just much bigger baskets, and our pickup business, which is growing faster than the total, our eCom business is growing fast than the pickup businesses are much larger ticket than what you see is a permanent store shopper, and then, on the marketplace and fulfillment services, again early in the journey, we're just a few quarters in, but excited about the leadership, and the team and what they're able to do for sellers, and this will -- the combination of this along with marketplaces, and then other relationships or sellers can easily list a number of items on the site, we think will provide a really valuable place for sellers to come and sell to our customers, so we're excited about the prospect of all these businesses. Doug McMillon : This is Doug. For the future, I would remind everybody that at this point we've got stores, pickup, delivery, a growing e-commerce fulfillment center assortment instead of capabilities and so we're positioned to serve them how they want to be served, how they want to shop. So, I think the flexibility to respond to 2021 and beyond is there, and the team's done a great job of reacting with speed. The cadence inside the company has picked up. We kind of smile when we think about the holiday because while we have to plan in some aspects of the holiday, we're managing near-term much more actively than we would in a different environment, so I think we're set up to have a business that will grow at a fast rate, and to manage the profitability of it. It was good to see in the last few years, our general merchandise business online grow and you guys know we've had a lot of brands a lot of items, and then, this last quarter it was unique because a lot of people were at home, and stimulus checks supported purchasing things for them to use at home, they obtain themselves or fix their home up. So, that was unique, but the commonality of it is that the GM business in Walmart is strong, and that contribution percentage, contribution profit percentage of e-commerce is an encouraging metric. So, I know you're all trying to figure out what the future looks like. I think we're fundamentally well positioned for it and then we'll manage the short-term to react to the opportunities that are presented. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks, guys. There's two questions; one, I'm just curious to talk about the gross margin improvement. How much of that was from the mix shift versus maybe if you can talk about, which categories or segments to see gross margin improvement on year-over-year basis, and then, second just back to the eCom profitability. Doug if the eCom runs up about 100% in for the rest of the year, what does profitability look like for 2020? Thanks. Doug McMillon : A lot better, and it's a lot better. We figured that out. Brett was reminding us this morning, if you get more sales, it helps everything else. So, we've written that down and we're going to talk about on that. I think John walked through the components of e-commerce earlier. I won't repeat all the pieces, but there are some big pieces of the e-commerce P&L that are moving in the right direction and they were before. It's just that these tailwinds accelerated that, so we don't know what the economy will look like next year in the U.S., we'll have to wait and see, but this theme of an omnichannel presence is happening inside the company, all over the world. We\u2019ve focused in this conversation a lot on the U.S. because that's where your questions went, but if you dig into what's happening at WALMEX, look at what Canada is starting to do. It's exciting to see that thematically this work is looking more and more common, and of course we're learning a lot from Flipkart and how they operate, but these conversations about strategy and the e-commerce P&L are increasingly common from country-to-country. Brett Biggs : On gross margin, there was a number of different things, which I mentioned a lot of it was mixed. Certainly general merchandise as Doug said, we've been very focused on general merchandise business and it's nice to see that really come to fruition in the second quarter, but also, just sell more of your markdowns and markdowns were a big part of the story and lack of markdowns, big part of story in Q2, fuel margins were also better. So, it's really all three of those things that were in our favor for the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Edward Yruma : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess, really quickly on last mile. I know you've been innovating a lot there. Could you give us an update on kind of your ability to roll-up this membership from a Spark perspective? If you see any changes in California due to AB5 and then second, just as you think about store comps, when some of your non-essential peers opened up, did you see any discernible difference? Thank you. Doug McMillon : Edward on last mile, today we're delivering from about 2,800 stores with line of sight expanding more, we've now got Express, which is a service that you can expect in delivery in just under two hours in some cases even faster than that in around 2,000 stores. So those are big numbers and getting bigger. So I think the ability for Walmart to expand its delivery service is strong, Spark is a program that we're running as you\u2019re aware mostly in the center of the country in the Midwest, and it's doing well and growing, and we're excited about the innovations that that the team were working on in Spark to make this a business platform that's easy, easier for drivers and others, and then\u2026 Brett Biggs : And then on the last question, it's Edward my sense that the order of things, the order of tailwinds that impacted the business were, one, stimulus; two, eating at home; three, being at home and all the things that you wanted to do to have the indoors and outdoors be more pleasurable and you weren't spending money if you're a customer on travel and lodging and things like that. So those dollars were available for you to buy things for your home as well. Those are the things that were more impactful tailwinds than whether or not other competitors were open. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask around working capital inventory in particular obviously, working capital has been a really nice tailwind for the business for the last couple of quarters in light of what inventory and receivables and payables have done. You've built-up a pretty sizable cash balance on the balance sheet, could you help us think about, how you think about positioning the cash balance going forward, whether it's preparedness for normalization of working capital or otherwise, and then if I think about inventory in particular, they're down 7.5%. Where would you have liked that to have been in a normal environment? Where you guys are positioning that? Doug McMillon : Ben, this is Doug. Brett will respond to the working capital questions. We're laughing here because if you've been in some stores with us in the second quarter early in the second quarter, we could have used inventory everywhere. I saw some stores that were remarkably like, just it was deeply concerning, and the team was obviously scrambling that we could walk you across Supercenter and we've felt pressure in eCommerce too, but we were obviously feeling pressure in the beef and pork categories was well reported, but we were out of stock on fabrics. We were having challenges in sporting goods, we needed a lot more inventory than what we had during portions of the second quarter, and we look a lot better today, but we were really a lot lighter than we would have wanted to be. Brett Biggs : Just an example, Ben, when we think about 25 million Americans would go fishing on a regular basis before February, and that number has now moved to 35 million. So, 10 million people decided to pick-up just this one hobby and playing Golf, bicycle is the same way. Doug McMillon : I love fishing in the week and we're still really liking basic terminal tackle hooks and bombers and stuff like that this kind of lead time on it, different than what this environment requires. Brett Biggs : Then on working capital, and then just how we think about capital allocation in general, it really hasn't changed. We're going to continue to support the business, our CapEx down a little bit, but I would think about that more is timing, just not wanting to interrupt our stores with everything that's going on. We have built up a little more cash than normal, and some of that just because we're generating more cash than we have in the past, but also it's not a bad time to have a little bit of extra cash on hand as opportunities come about and just ensuring that we protect the business but wouldn't -- as far as I would say about capital allocation, I wouldn't view any changes in that. Ben Bienvenu : Thank you. Operator : At this time, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Now, I will turn the floor back to Doug for closing comments. Doug McMillon : We don't have anything else to say other than thanks for paying attention to the company, and we appreciate you dialing in today. Thanks. Brett Biggs : Thank you. Operator : Thanks, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

Dan Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to Walmart\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I\u2019m joined by several members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; and Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you an update on the business and discuss third quarter results that will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC, as well as risks and uncertainties resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. In addition, we have posted our fiscal year 2022 earnings release dates on our IR website stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re happy to visit with you about another strong quarter. As this challenging moment in history continues, we\u2019ve seen the best in our associates. They keep showing up and stepping up. They are adapting and becoming what we must become to thrive in the next generation of retail. Our leaders are learning and applying new skills at a new pace. We\u2019re grateful for and proud of how they\u2019re bringing our purpose and values to life. With the outbreak of COVID-19, the retail world clicked to a fast-forward, and our ability to adapt quickly has been crucial. Changes in customer behavior have accelerated the shift to eCommerce and digital. We were well positioned to catch and ride these waves given our previous work and investments. Our eCommerce and omni-channel penetration continued to rise, accelerating trends by two to three years in some cases. We\u2019re convinced that most of the behavior change will persist beyond the pandemic and that our combination of strong stores and emerging digital capabilities will be a winning formula. Customers will want to be served in a variety of ways, and we\u2019re positioned to save them money, provide the variety of product choices they are looking for, and deliver the experience they choose in the moment. Now, let me cover some quarterly highlights. Despite an unusual and softer back-to-school season and less benefit from government stimulus spending versus the first half of the year, revenue for the third quarter increased 6.1% in constant currency and adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.34, an increase of 15.5% versus last year. Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter. Comp sales increased 6.4% and we significantly reduced operating losses in eCommerce. Consistent with the second quarter, we saw customers consolidate shopping trips with larger baskets and fewer transactions. Comp sales accelerated from the beginning of the quarter, helped by food, consumables, and health and wellness. eCommerce grew 79%. Growth was strong in pickup and delivery as well as direct-to-home with the highest growth coming from marketplace. We also launched Walmart+, and we\u2019re excited to have that important piece of the puzzle in place. We launched it with an initial set of benefits that we know are important to our customers. Over time, we\u2019ll evaluate the program against our broader set of assets with the aim of improving the value proposition and deepening our relationship with customers, including earning a greater share of wallet. Our merchant and replenishment teams are working hard to ensure we have products available for our customers. In-stock levels have improved from Q2, but we\u2019re still below where we want to be. The team is being flexible when it comes to meeting demand. For example, we\u2019ve turned on nearly 2,500 stores to fulfill online orders. We can quickly flex this number as the holiday season progresses to help relieve pressure on our eCommerce fulfillment centers, if necessary. This holiday season will obviously be unique. While many family gatherings may be smaller, we do believe families want to decorate, celebrate, and enjoy food and gifts. They want a sense of normalcy. And our traditions help bring some joy and comfort to this difficult year. With the importance of social distancing in mind, we planned several holiday shopping events this year, so customers can enjoy special items and pricing over a longer period of time and shop in a way that\u2019s best for them. At Sam\u2019s Club, strong comp sales of 15.3%, minus fuel and tobacco, included a good balance of increased ticket and transactions. Great items drive the club business, and our merchandising offer is compelling. Our strength in fresh food and the uniqueness of Member\u2019s Mark continue to make it special to be a member. Membership income is vital for Sam\u2019s, and we\u2019re encouraged by our performance. New member signups were strong. Overall, renewal rates increased nicely and renewal rates for Plus members increased more than 350 basis points. Consistent with the growing popularity of a contactless shopping experience, Scan & Go penetration is up more than 600 basis points and curbside delivery has been well received by members and is growing well above our overall comp sales. Outside the U.S., we had another solid quarter, performance-wise; and we announced additional portfolio actions to increase our focus on priority markets. Overall, net sales increased 5% in constant currency and comp sales were positive in eight of 10 markets.  In India, Flipkart and PhonePe had strong results for the quarter. The number of monthly active customers for these platforms is at an all-time high. At Walmex, we continue to see good results as comp sales once again outpaced the overall market. eCommerce is also accelerating with growth of more than 200% for the second consecutive quarter. Customers are increasingly looking for omni-channel solutions and we\u2019re providing it for them. In Mexico, we completed the rollout of same-day delivery to all Sam\u2019s Club locations; and in Central America, we opened our first store with omni-channel capabilities. In Canada, we saw broad-based strength across categories, especially in food and consumables. We see strong growth in eCommerce in this market too with sales growth of 177%. We\u2019re focused on providing more digital solutions for customers to make shopping easier. With a national rollout, mobile check-in customers can now use their phone to check-in when picking up their online grocery order. We continue a series of actions to increase our focus on priority markets. We\u2019ve recently announced the sale of our businesses in the U.K., Argentina and Japan. These teams have been an important part of Walmart and we\u2019ll miss them. They will continue to innovate and grow under the new ownership structures, positioning them for future success. We\u2019re committed to our stated priorities and you can see it with these actions along with others in the U.S., including Jet and VUDU. We know where to invest, and we\u2019ll be aggressive where we should be, while taking action in other areas. Before closing, I\u2019d like to touch on a few additional points. The recent rise in COVID cases throughout the country reminds us we must remain vigilant. As we\u2019ve done since the beginning of the outbreak, we will continue being disciplined about the safety protocols throughout our stores, clubs, distribution, and fulfillment centers. We\u2019re reinforcing our messaging to customers, members, and associates regarding wearing face coverings, social distancing, and other safety measures. While the health and safety of our customers, members, and associates is our first priority, we realize the increasing cases will put more pressure on small businesses that have been heavily impacted by the pandemic. As various governments around the country tighten up to help keep people healthy, it will be imperative that elected officials in Washington work together to deliver the help so many small businesses need to get through this next phase of the pandemic. Leading on social and environmental issues has become part of our core business for over 15 years now and so despite COVID-19 that work has naturally continued. ESG work is part of who we are. Across the company, creating economic opportunity for associates through jobs and advancement is something we\u2019re proud of. We were pleased to adjust our store structure and increased wages for around 165,000 associates in Walmart U.S., and more than 20,000 received increases in Sam\u2019s Club U.S. We\u2019re also pleased to have hired over 0.5 million new associates during the course of this year, globally, as so many of them need to work. A few other recent examples include the work we\u2019re doing to increase racial equity and address climate change. We created shared value networks made up of Walmart associates, who are looking at ways we can make a difference in education, financial, healthcare and criminal justice systems. They are finding natural overlaps between our core business and opportunities to advance racial equity. For example, we launched a new race and inclusion curriculum and we\u2019ve seen hundreds of thousands of associates access it since August. We also have a new requirement for U.S.-based officers to complete racial equity training. And to drive further transparency on the progress we\u2019re making, we launched the first ever mid-year diversity report. As for our environment, we\u2019ve set a goal of becoming a regenerative company. We want to do more than slow down the damage to our planet. We want to reverse that process and actually add back and strengthen nature. We\u2019re working to restore, renew and replenish our planet and we encourage others, including our suppliers, to do the same. We\u2019ve set a date of 2040 to target zero emissions without relying on carbon offsets in our own operations and fleet. This builds on our leadership as being the first retailer with a science-based target for emissions reduction. Please take a few minutes to learn more about what we\u2019re doing by referencing our ESG report on our corporate website and accessing the Virtual Milestone Meeting we recently hosted, which you will also find there. Last, I want to wrap up by saying congratulations to President-elect Biden. We look forward to working with the administration in both houses of Congress to move the country forward and solve issues on behalf of our associates, customers and other stakeholders. We thank you all for your interest in our company. Happy holidays. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were strong and highlight the continued progress in our omni-channel strategy. We continued delivering solid results while positioning the business to win long-term. We also continue to allocate capital toward the most compelling long-term opportunities demonstrated by continued investments in supply chain, eCommerce technology and store innovation, while reshaping our global market portfolio. Despite the challenges of this unique time, associates around the world continue to do an outstanding job, responding to the customers' need for greater shopping flexibility by accelerating omni initiatives. We\u2019re creating and launching new products and services such as Walmart+, helping us develop deeper relationships with customers. In fact, we\u2019ve doubled the number of U.S. store associates supporting digital and omni initiatives this year. We believe we have the customer focused strategy to win long-term. Now let\u2019s discuss Q3 results. Total constant currency revenue growth was strong, up 6.1% to more than $135 billion. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased more than 6%, international net sales grew 5% in constant currency, and Sam\u2019s Club grew comp sales more than 15% excluding fuel and tobacco. The health crisis continued to shape shopping behaviors with trip consolidation, larger baskets and growing eCommerce penetration. Gross profit margin was strong in each segment and increased 50 basis points in total, aided by strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, while eCommerce margins also improved. SG&A leverage of 18 basis points in Q3 was aided by lapping last year\u2019s non-cash impairment charge of approximately $300 million or 23 basis points, but was negatively impacted by nearly $600 million or 44 basis points of COVID-related costs. We continue to see operating efficiency improvements around the company. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis was up more than 16% and adjusted EPS of $1.34 was a 15.5% increase versus last year\u2019s Q3 adjusted EPS. GAAP EPS was $1.80 which includes an unrealized gain on our investment in jd.com, partially offset by $0.34 loss on the sale of Argentina due primarily to foreign currency losses. Operating cash flows year-to-date has been exceptional and was up approximately $8.3 billion versus last year to nearly $23 billion. Free cash flow was $9.7 billion higher due to increased sales, continued operating discipline and lower CapEx, some of which is timing. Inventory increased about 60 basis points in Q3, due primarily to timing of holiday events. We resumed share repurchases in Q3 with more than $450 million repurchased during the quarter. Now, let\u2019s discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter with comp sales, excluding fuel, up 6.4%, and eCommerce sales growth of 79%. eCommerce sales were strong in all channels throughout the quarter. Walmart.com traffic has been robust with solid increases in repeat rates and good momentum in marketplace sales, which grew in triple-digits. As we noted when we announced Q2 earnings, third quarter sales started out a bit softer, particularly in the U.S., due to a delayed back-to-school season. However, sales picked up in September and the momentum continued through October. Consistent with prior quarters, we saw continued strength in home, electronics and sporting goods. We\u2019re pleased with market share gains in several general merchandise categories according to NPD. Grocery sales also strengthened throughout the quarter, led by strong comp sales in food categories, helped by expanded store hours, improving in-stocks and strong price positioning. We continue to see trip consolidation in significantly larger baskets in Q3, resulting in average ticket increase of about 24% and a transaction decrease of about 14%. Customer transactions began to improve after we expanded store hours and we expect this trend to continue as we further extend store hours this month. Gross profit rate was strong, up 33 basis points due primarily to strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns. We continue to make progress on eCommerce margin rates as we drive faster growth of marketplace sales and improve product mix. Also, the phased reopening of the Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers during Q3, has alleviated some of the negative margin pressure experienced during the first half. The carryover of last year\u2019s price investment continued to negatively affect margin rate. Incremental COVID-related costs of more than $430 million negatively affected expense leverage by about 50 basis points. As a result, the U.S. segment deleveraged nine basis points. Operating income was up 9.9% for the quarter, including a continued reduction in eCommerce losses. Inventory increased 5.5%, primarily reflecting the timing of holiday merchandise flow and the continued recovery of in-stock levels from earlier in the year. We\u2019re making good progress to get certain categories to higher in-stock levels and overall, we feel good about our position for the fourth quarter. While it\u2019s still early in the quarter with big sales days in front of us, we expect it to be a good holiday season. International delivered strong Q3 results with net sales up 5% in constant currency, including 56% eCommerce growth. Currency fluctuations were a headwind to sales of approximately $1.1 billion. eCommerce penetration continues to accelerate and grew nearly 500 basis points this quarter. Eight of 10 markets posted positive comps, with sales in Canada and Mexico, particularly strong, including triple-digit eCommerce growth in both markets. Flipkart continues to perform well and recently completed its best ever Big Billion Days sales event in October. Their third quarter GMV continued to reflect strong demand post-COVID lockdowns, with significant growth in monthly active customers. Canada comps increased more than 7%, with broad-based strength both in stores and online, and China saw continued strength with double-digit comp growth in Sam\u2019s Clubs and eCommerce growth of over 60% despite some softness in hypermarkets. Comp sales in Mexico grew more than 5% as the omni-channel strategy continues to accelerate. International adjusted operating income was strong, aided by government stimulus in various markets, Flipkart\u2019s improved margin mix as well as cost savings initiatives in Mexico. The quarter included incremental COVID-related costs of approximately $65 million. Operating income increased 70% on a reported basis and about 22% on an adjusted constant currency basis, excluding the benefit from lapping last year\u2019s impairment charge. Sam\u2019s Club had another terrific quarter with comp sales growth of 15.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco with contributions from both increased transactions and average ticket. Strength was broad based across categories with food and consumables leading the way. eCommerce sales grew 41% with strong demand for direct-to-home delivery and increased club pickup. We\u2019re pleased with the strong membership trends at Sam\u2019s as membership income grew 10.4% in Q3, the best quarterly performance in five years. This reflects higher renewal rates, robust new member sign ups and rising Plus penetration. Strong sales in gross margins more than offset the approximate $80 million of additional COVID-related costs, resulting in an operating income increase of nearly 32%. Consistent with prior quarters, we aren\u2019t providing FY2021 financial guidance due to continued uncertainty around the key external variables related to the health crisis and their potential impact on our business and the global economy. The health crisis continues to create both tailwinds and headwinds for our business. In Q3, we saw strong sales aided by some stock buying and continued stimulus spending, albeit to a lesser extent in the first half of the year. Q4 will feel different from past years as customer shop differently and shopping events are spread out. eCommerce and omni-channel penetration continue to accelerate and we are in a good position to serve customers this holiday season. We expect COVID-related costs to continue for some time, along with some general global uncertainties. In addition, currency headwinds remain elevated. If rates stay where they are today, the top line impact would be around $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Despite the unique challenges this year, Walmart\u2019s financial position remains rock solid, and our strong performance reinforces the advantages of our omni strategy. We\u2019ll leverage our scale, unique assets and financial strength to continue positioning the company for growth in the U.S. and in key markets around the world. I remain very optimistic about what this company can do in the future. As always, thank you for your interest in Walmart and we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The Walmart U.S. grocery comps have been strong but increased half the rate as the conventional grocers have been reporting. So as you look towards next year when the grocery category retraces due to the shift back to food away-from-home, should the Walmart, who has grocery business slow less than others because it didn't rise as much this year? And also if you could give us some sense has the Walmart U.S. eCommerce gross margin reached an inflection point where it can sustainably generate increases year-over-year because of mixed third party contribution and the impact of Walmart Plus subscribers? Thank you very much and have a good holiday season. John Furner : He good morning Michael. This is John Furner with the U.S. segment. Let me take the question on food first. In the quarter, we were happy with the results. Our food comps in total were just in, call it the mid-to-high single-digit range. And we did see sheer improvements from the second quarter; and we think in the second quarter, our comps would have been influenced by shorter store hours. We were opened only till 8 :30 in the evening. We've recently expanded to 10 :00 p.m., and in some locations where we felt it was safe, we moved downwards to 11 :00 p.m. at night. And those have had improvements. We\u2019re seeing a trend improvement on our food share in total over the two quarters. Looking at the food business in general, our in-stock position is much better in the third quarter \u2013 was much better in the third quarter than was in the second. And then generally speaking, our price position has remained very strong in Q2 and Q3, which is at a better position than it was in the first quarter of the year. So, we are we're pleased with the improvements in share trends in the third quarter, from the second quarter. And then the last thing I'd say is the team has also done a very nice job with the online pickup business. We've doubled the number of people that are working in that business, up to about 130,000 \u2013 140,000, which is 2x of what it was a year ago. So overall the improvements in food share has been pleasant from the third quarter than the second. I think your second question was on eCommerce margin specifically. And Michael, those results are a reflection of mostly mix as we described, our home business has been solid online, our apparel business has led, and then the overall winner in the eCommerce business was our marketplace business which led the marketplace or led the eCom comps in total to 79% for the quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Also just wanted to ask about the reduced eCommerce losses and curious about just how Walmart Plus could maybe change the trajectory of that at all, I know it's still early days but just curious on how to think about that longer-term? And then also just in terms of capacity for eCommerce, is it possible that stores could become a permanent area of capacity in fulfilling online orders or given the significant growth this year, is there any need to expand fulfillment center capacity? Doug McMillon : I'll start Kelly, this is Doug, and then John can jump in. I think, as it relates to Walmart Plus and losses, we\u2019re putting together an ecosystem, these parts are connected and I do think Walmart Plus can be helpful in a lot of ways over time and the information that we'll have about customers, the ability to personalize, I think we'll be able to serve them better in both sides, the stores and eCommerce will come to life in a way that helps make Walmart Plus even stronger. But I wouldn't underestimate the significance of the other components as it relates to eCommerce losses and eCommerce growth, kind of the basic blocking and tackling, getting the contribution profit to a healthy level, things like mix that John just mentioned a minute ago, apparel and home mix in particular, the ability to leverage costs to pick efficiently, obviously getting things into one box as much as possible, getting shipping efficiencies, all of those kinds of things are going to generate a sustainable businesses as it relates to eCommerce as a channel over time. We will keep an eye on eCommerce as a business, of course, but also remember we've got all these other levers where it's an omnichannel business, we've got a lot of variables on the store side, so when we think of how we blend the combination of revenue, expenses, and profitability together, we think of it in a holistic fashion. It is great to see how stores have been playing a role with fulfillment. John Furner : And Kelly, at a certain point this year, in the second quarter, we had up to 2,500 stores working as fulfillment centers to handle demand and been in the last few months, we've been able to open more fulfillment center capacity, including staffing up to be able to pick orders and ship from store. So, I think the important note there is, as Walmart has so many assets that can be used to take care of customers in any way they want to shop, whether they shop in-store, pick up at the store, or have orders delivered. Operator : Next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Paul Trussell : Good morning, and very solid quarter. You spoke confidently about the holiday season likely to be a healthy and strong one. Maybe just elaborate on your views on 4Q, maybe what you're seeing to-date and anything that we should keep in mind from a modeling standpoint. And then separately, would be really interested in you speaking to the specific transactions that have taken place in Walmart International and just how we should think about the overall strategy and the way you're managing that portfolio. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Paul, I'll start out. This is Doug, as it relates to holiday, now let's keep in mind we've got multiple markets and a lot of different scenarios, but there are some common trends, people are at home more, they're eating at home more, and they've all been through a difficult year. So just emotionally, I don't know what you're thinking, but in my family while it would be a smaller group, we're really looking forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's, and some sense of joy and normalcy. And I think we'll see that play out as it relates to consumption patterns in the U.S. and beyond. John, if you want to add some things for U.S. and then we've got Judith on today, and we'll go to her for the International portfolio response. John Furner : Sure. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, Paul. We planned for a good holiday season. As Doug said, we are planning for what we would describe as the new normal for customers this holiday, which will include staying at home, being in smaller groups. We think to be of course, more celebrations as groups are smaller all around the country. Our events, which last year would have been more of a singular event, we have several events that are planned, a few that are behind us and more to come. We plan these events to be omni-lead. So they give customers the option of being able to buy online and pick up in store, buy online have shipped or shop-in the store. And we made it very flexible. So customers could do what is best for them. We've called this Deals for Days. We've had three events online already. We've had two events in stores, and then we'll have more as the season goes on and we're looking forward to the next 10 days of being ready for customers to shop further for the Thanksgiving meal. But overall, we feel good about our plan for the fourth quarter. We feel good about our in-stock and our inventory position in general merchandise. And then I'll turn it over to Judith to talk about the International transactions. Judith McKenna : Hi, Paul, clearly transactions in the last six weeks announced as the Argentina and Japan, completely inline based on the strategy that we set out earlier in the year, with strong local businesses powered by Walmart and our ability to be flexible in the ownership structures that we have, whether that are the public companies that we've got minority ownership or majority ownership around the world, all three of those, we think position those markets to be very successful. In Argentina, we\u2019re divested fully, but in the UK and Japan we\u2019re retaining a stake in those businesses, as we help them continue on their transformation journeys as well. We're going to continue to focus market at the time. Our priority markets are clear India, China, Mexico and Canada, but actually every market that we have plays a role in the portfolio in some way. And I think that Japan is a really good example announced on someday, really how we can bring together people, not only to do a digital transformation for Japan, but more importantly, how much Walmart can continue to learn in that relationship as well. And we continue a relationship with them on a commercial basis in respect to providing global sourcing. This is a really new type of model that we're creating for International, we said a little bit clear on our priorities and I think we are showing that we have done that, but at the same time we still really benefit from all of the good things about being a global retailer, not least a great sharing of products and innovation and talent around the world. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much. A couple of questions just related to your U.S. comp, I'm wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what the impact would have been on your comp in this quarter, but I mean, probably applies to 2Q as well from the actual reduction in hours. And then you did mention that you've extended the hours by another hour, I guess, in some stores. Any thoughts on going back to 24 hours? And then the second question I had was with respect to Walmart Plus, would you be willing to provide a little color in terms of what the average ticket is on those transactions? Because I think there's some view that it could be very dilutive as the ticket is lower than you would have hoped for. John Furner : Hey, Karen, good morning, it's John Furner. Let me take the first question on the hours first. Let me first say, I am really appreciative of the work that our associates have done this entire year. They have stepped up as Doug said earlier and served their customers, served their communities in taking care of each other. And I want to start with that because it's just an important to reiterate that our first priority all year long has been to do whatever we could to protect associates safety, customer safety and serve our communities. And so the reduction in hours in the first and then the second quarter are primarily to ensure that associates were able to cover the stores as needed. We also had changed our leave of absence policy, which enabled associates to take off anytime they needed, if they weren't feeling well or they needed to stay at home. The hours did changed in Q3, so during the three, I wouldn't be able to give you a number that was saying how much it affected the results by, but we do know that the sheer losses in Q2 subsided and improved in Q3. So we played that this definitely has a part of it. We don't have any guidance yet on whether we'll go back to 24 hours at what point, at this point we'll operate 7 :00 to 10 :00 or 7 :00 to 11 :00, depending on what the store is able to handle in terms of staffing and whatever local regulations would allow for. On the Plus program, as we said earlier, we're excited about the offer, we think it's an important part of the Walmart ecosystem for customers to be able to experience all of the benefits that Walmart has to offer. We want this to be a very friction-free experience for the customer and whether the customer is shopping in the store with Scan and Go or using our fuel discounts, which are available at our Walmart gas stations, Murphy, Murphy Express and now Sam's Club, and then finally be able to get unlimited delivery on food, consumables and general merchandise from the store. We think it's a really compelling offer that customers will enjoy being a part of and being able to benefit from. The program is new, so we don't have a lot to share at this point and we're still learning. We're focused on the best experience we can possibly deliver for our customers. And we're looking forward to the impact that the program will have. It might be worth repeating the stat we've shared with you over the last few years that when a customer shops us in-store and online, they spend about twice as much and they spend more in store, those are pre-pandemic stats, we\u2019re not updating those at this moment, but it is important to remember once they're engaged in a digital relationship and they're shopping as holistically like that, the value of that customer relationship goes up. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Good morning guys. My question is just on the Walmart Health initiative, I'm just curious, kind of the near-term and longer-term plans, maybe how COVID has impacted that. I know it was a hot topic earlier this year, but certainly other things have come up. So just looking for an update there and what your strategy is? Thanks so much. Doug McMillon : Hey, good morning, Peter. We remain excited about the opportunity in health and wellness in general, including Walmart Health, we haven't made any changes to our plan. We've opened few clinics since we most recently spoke, and we are excited about the demand that we saw in the first six months in the year including last year, since we opened our first clinic in Dallas, Georgia. We continue to work on our mix and learn about the types of services that we want to offer customers. And there's no change that I would be wanting to make at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from the Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hi, everyone. Good morning. So I have two questions, the first one is on market share, the second, just another follow-up to Plus. On market share, I think stepping back, you're obviously having a very good year both top and bottom line despite the challenging in the \u2013 challenges in operating. The \u2013 you're growing above your normalized rates and your dollars are pretty big. But if you look across the rest of retail, you're starting \u2013 you are seeing robust results. And so, it suggests you might not be gaining as much share. I don't think you're losing. I think in food maybe it's partly because the lack of promotions in some channels. But I want to ask you, if you \u2013 when you look at your results versus others, how do you explain the difference? You meant \u2013 John just mentioned some store hours, is it anything about inventory at this point or maybe the customer not having the same wallet share shift? And then the question on Plus, maybe just a follow-up for John if you're willing to share, how it's performing versus expectations? And then anything on the percentage of new customers coming to the platform? Doug McMillon : And let me take the share question, first, Simeon. As we said, our share in Q3, the trend did improve in total food. Our general merchandise share has gained in Q3 and also in the second quarter. Q3 did start slower in general merchandise and picked up as the quarter went along, so we were pleased with that. As far as the average ticket and pricing, we are seeing across the entire box, what we describe as modest deflation, a little bit of inflation in some food categories, but no major change there. Our price gaps did widen in the second quarter versus what they had been in the first, and they remain wide in Q3. So certainly, there are less promotions around the market and I think our unit growth, as mentioned earlier and the transaction size, has benefited from those. As far as the Plus business, we are excited about the results. It's really early on. We just launched this in the middle to the late \u2013 latter part of Q3, so we don't have anything yet. We're still learning. We're excited about the offer. We know customers are excited about the offer. We do serve about 90% of the population within a 10-mile radius and just in the last quarter we added another 230 stores that can do pickup that brings our total to 3,700 stores, then we've got 2,700 stores that are now offering what we describe as Express Delivery. And we have examples even just this week of customers who are getting their groceries, from the time of order delivery in under half hour. So, we're really excited about the ability to have services like that all across the country in big cities, in small cities and everything in between. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your questions. Robert Drbul : Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess the first quick question that I had, Doug and Brett, is it true that you guys were Tik-Toking this morning before the call started? Doug McMillon : Brett was \u2013 I was just watching. Robert Drbul : All right. But my second question then would be, can you talk a little bit about the consumer \u2013 what trends you're seeing with the consumer in terms of pantry loading again sort of move to value versus convenience and your ability to really manage in-stocks in this environment still today? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Yes, I'll go first. I think Bob, as you look at what's happening in the U.S. in particular \u2013 and Judith, you may have comments about outside the US \u2013 I think the way to think of this is locally, it really does have everything to do with what's happening with COVID cases in any particular community. I was in stores last week and I saw variance from one state to the other, one location to the other, just depends on how people are feeling in that moment. But what the action is the same as what we saw before. They're just stocking up on paper goods, cleaning supplies and dry grocery, should they need them. And so, I think we're going to be able to respond in this instance better than we did in the first half of the year, although we're still \u2013 as a total supply chain \u2013 still stressed in some places. It's disappointing to watch our rationalities and see as many out of stocks as we had in consumables right now, generally, although it's a whole lot better than it was earlier in the year. So, I think we'll manage through these curves. They'll be localized. We will respond. We got to keep these food and consumable DCs operating. Our logistics team is doing a fantastic job of doing that. But it feels to me like we'll work through this period of time better than we did in the first wave. John Furner : And Doug, I agree, we do see big differences depending on the communities that you are in. I've also been out the last couple of weeks and including the last two weekends, and it really depends on what's going on in the state and the city that we're in. The specific categories where we have the most strain at the present time would be bath tissue and cleaning supplies. Some of our inventory position on hand sanitizer, mask is very good; dry grocery has recovered in many cases, although there are still parts of supply chain that are stressed by components that just haven't been available, including things like aluminum and cans packaging. So those things have definitely had an impact. But overall, I'm pleased with the improvements in availability, including the fresh meat department. The team there is doing a great job of getting things back in stock. We still see some stress in things like daily bacon and breakfast foods. But in general, there is product available just in store fronts like how it was. And then finally, I would just complement our produce team that has just done a great job of sourcing produce and maintain quality and fresh levels throughout the entire year. So, the teams are really working hard and I'm really thankful and grateful for the work that our inventory teams and merchandising teams have done at Walmart in the grocery departments. Judith McKenna : And maybe just a\u2026 Operator : Sorry, please go ahead. I apologize. Judith McKenna : Robert, maybe just a comment from around the world, which is again, it varies deeply by country, so U.K. in full lockdown, China pretty much life back to normal there. Just the only things to add to John and Doug's comments, eat at home continues to be a trend everywhere, mainly which we are benefiting from. Supply chains around the world are hulk about. But overall, just seeing festival seasons, and I would take that as everything from on Christmas through to Diwali and staffing strongly and people being happy with, buying things for themselves and for their homes as they go through that period as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen. Oliver Chen : Hi, thank you. Happy holidays. Regarding advertising, we're seeing a lot of really great research for your advertising program. What's ahead as this may intersect with Walmart Plus, how it could impact profitability and your views on longer term share gains? I would also love your view on automation and micro fulfillment centers as well as the connected store, if you could update us on key thoughts in the midst of the pandemic and what you're seeing with the consumer and the connected store execution? That would be great. Thank you, John Furner : Hey Oliver. Thanks for the feedback on the advertising. We are proud of the team and the work they're doing, and they're \u2013 I think they're doing a great job of getting the message out and the benefit of things like time savings and being able to spend more time with your family and do the things that are important. And we think those are key components of what the Walmart Plus offer has for our customers \u2013 being able to order your groceries and have them delivered without worrying about whether you have it delivered or not. It's just part of the program. Even saving time while in store with Scan & Go is a nice benefit as well. So I think it's just part of mix. This is a service that we already offer. We've had a delivery business for some time now. That's been growing for some time. I'm really happy with the growth of delivery in the second quarter and the third quarter. There has been growth in both quarters and that's exciting to see. I think the team is doing a nice job figuring how to leverage delivery costs and putting multiple orders in cars. They're building density all across the country and that's exciting to see. I think the second point to make is our merchants are really focused on the omni customer, and so more and more I hear from our merchants, they are thinking of their businesses in terms of a customer strategy rather than a channel strategy, so the lines are blurring between e-Commerce and stores and it's all about serving the customer the way they want to be served, whether that's letting the customer \u2013 having the customer be welcome to shop in-store, pick up at the store or that \u2013 or delivery. I mean as far as your question on automation, we're still excited about programs that we have going on a regional distribution centers and fulfillment centers. In both cases, we've got a lot of innovation and the team is doing a great job of figuring out how to deliver to stores and the customers, orders that are not only productive and our variable cost per unit has gone down even though the last quarter, as we mentioned with e-Commerce losses, but we're doing a nice job. Have been able to service stores more timely and more accurately. And then finally, at the local level, we do continue to have innovations that are starting to really work and we're excited about what's in the future when it comes to things like our Alert program that's piloted in New Hampshire and we have other locations planned for that technology. And then we're also evaluating other technologies that would help us, of course, expand our capacity at stores to be able to pick and deliver orders as they come in. Doug McMillon : It's been great to see some of the pilots that we've had, in terms of automation, start to really work. We'll be talking to you guys more about that in the future, but automation will be a big part of what we do. And it will play a role in helping the store experience get better as it reduces the amount of work the associates have at store level just moving freight around. I hope, you can also see \u2013 Oliver, back to your first question \u2013 that the company is changing and shaping its business model, the way that we make money today and the way we'll make money in the future will be more multifaceted, whether it's marketplace or advertising, Walmart Plus, Walmart Fulfillment Services and other things to come in the future. We've just got this great opportunity, this asset, in terms of these customer relationships, any other fiscal assets that we have, to monetize it in a variety of ways. And we're building those capabilities and you can start to see it in our results. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Kate McShane [Goldman Sachs]. Kate McShane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just from a promotional standpoint, I think you noted last quarter that competitors, particularly in grocery, were not promoting as heavily because of the strong demand. I wondered if you could comment in terms of what you saw with regards to promotions in Q3 and now as we get into holiday for Q4? And just in general, how much price investment impacted gross margins in the third quarter? Doug McMillon : Hi, Kate. Let me take the first question. In terms of the market, in Q2, we did note that we saw less promotions around the market and primarily that would have been caused by the number of stock outs that we're seeing nationally due to the run-up in what we call the first phase of stocking up at home, right when the pandemic began. In the third quarter, in food and consumables, there wasn't much change that we noted from the third quarter to the second. So again in the quarter we definitely saw less promotions; as we said earlier, our price gap versus our competition wide ending the second quarter and remained wide in the third quarter. The difference in late Q3 and then into Q4 would be the different schedules that we're seeing all around the country regarding holiday events and gift buying. We are excited about the plans that we have in the fourth quarter. As I said earlier, a number of those events have already happened, and we have more plans over the course of the month. And I'm really excited about the offer that our entertainment team, our electronics team has put together. We're excited about the game offers that they have. I'm excited about the items that we have in toys. We've got 1,300 new items in toys and 800 items that are unique to Walmart and the toy department this year. And we've gotten great feedback from number of kids and our program that we call Walmart Camp Online has also been really successful this year. And that gave customers an opportunity to do things at home and spend time together. So I think that fourth quarter, while we don't have guidance on that today, I think the fourth quarter is definitely planned well. I think the team here at Walmart and have done a great job thinking about safety and being able to give customers options so they can shop to the way that they want to shop and be able to celebrate their holiday the way they want to and buy guests for Walmart, and I'm excited about the plan the team has Operator : The next question is from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Ed Yruma : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You guys have made some really good strides in improving the mix in e-com into adding more vendors to marketplace, I guess, how would you score, where you sit today and how should we think about the incremental opportunity that's still remaining? Thank you. Doug McMillon : We're just getting started. I think that's the end. That's the question, I mean. We have made progress and I'm grateful for the job that Mark and John and the team has done to build a big marketplace business, but we've got a lot of upside in front of us and a lot of \u2013 a lot of things that we can do to improve customer experience and to drive income for the company. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Thanks guys. I'm curious how much the improvement in the international segment gross margin was driven by geographic or country mix versus improvements you're seeing in the specific markets. Maybe you talk about which market we're seeing the biggest increases in gross margin rate; what's driving that? And just high-level guys, I'm just curious how you're thinking about planning for 2021? Again, what is been a very strong year? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Let's take the international question first, Judith. Judith McKenna : Yes. Thank you. Yes. The improvement around the world in gross margin levels. Clearly, our biggest market has an impact. Roll Mat, in particular, the U.K. and Canada all showing improvements. They both benefited from [indiscernible], particularly in the U.K. to high-margin [indiscernible]. But also, there's a lot of work done by the teams looking at cost of goods savings, underlying initiatives. And then we've also seen in some of our eCommerce businesses a shift into marketplaces as well, which has really helped us. So around the world, it's a combination of factors, driven primarily by our markets, which has been very pleasing to see. Doug McMillon : As it relates to planning we look forward to the memo that you'll send us to explain it all, but if we \u2013 if we were to think through it, we're optimistic as I'm sure all of you are about how the back half of next year should start to look a bit more normal. We still have a ways to go to get there and we'll manage through it as we have been managing through this year. We do have momentum in a number of key areas. And the way that I think about it is almost regardless of what the market number looks like or what the economic environment looks like. We're in control of a lot of our own destiny. We know what customers want, and we have capabilities and are adding to those capabilities to be able to serve them. So we're on our front foot. We are thinking about this offensively, and next year, there'll be tailwinds and headwinds that we're up against. Our in stock will be better. Our ability to service customers through e-commerce including pick and delivery from stores will be better. We will have fewer COVID-19 expenses. We hope and pray, and so all of those things we'll navigate as we go through the year, but our mindset going in is an offensive mindset. Brett Biggs : And there's, we've talked about it before, this is Brett. There is some, Doug mentioned earlier, so many levers we can pull as a company just given the \u2013 all of the business that we do in various parts of the world, but also the types of businesses that we have in the U.S. gives us, I think, more flexibility than some \u2013 than some competitors, and it's finding that balance of we've got a plan, John, with our merchants, but at the same time, just remaining flexible to deal with what comes our way. But I'm with Doug. I think we control a lot of that. Paul Lejuez : I taught Michael's question to kick things off a few minutes ago was a really good one. We did see customers when we started running out of stocks in the first stage of the stock-up period, they ran to local grocers and that's totally understandable. They also tried to shop close to home and went to small stores more frequently. That's also totally understandable, and our in-stocks struggled. And so when I think about next year with our in-stock being there, the price gaps that we have, I feel like we got a great opportunity next year, as we look at what's in front of us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Thanks a lot. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of those points focused on online grocery. I think there was a conventional view a couple of years ago that there was a ceiling as it relates to online penetration or penetration of online grocery when using the store, it would just be limited to a point before it becomes disruptive to the store. What are you guys learning about that? And if you could also discuss the progress in increasing capacity for online grocery, I know you held it back in Q1 because of the inventory. You discuss last quarter, a big pickup in the number of slots. So how is that progressing and any other efforts to increase the efficiency, so that you can support that incremental volume into next year? That would be helpful. Thank you. John Furner : Got it. This is John. Thanks for the question. Back to your very first statement on online grocery where we've really reframed online grocery this year to just be online pickup and delivery and more and more \u2013 we're offering more items in the super center that are available for pickup and the super center, which is just a fantastic retail format is also at times in the year operated as a fulfillment center. We had up to 2,500 stores that were shipping from home. We still have hundreds going to the quarter, and the team has done \u2013 have done a very nice job using all parts of the supply chain to fulfill our e-commerce demand, which would be reflected in the results that we saw in the quarter of growth of 79%. As far as picking itself, over the course of the year, the team did struggle in the first quarter, obviously, with the number of out of stocks that we had, and we pulled some capacity back as we focused on getting the stores back in stock. And then as the stores have gotten back in stock, as we said earlier, we've doubled the number of people that are working in our pickup department up to 140,000. So a very significant increase over the year before. We're using machine learning to figure out the best way to put a labor against the slots also when to pick the slots and then went to determine what we can fill. So we've got some nice productivity improvements there. On top of our regular pick system, which is basically the slot system, we launched express delivery, that's live in 2,700 stores, and we're really excited about the results in the first three quarters of the year with Express. So that's been exciting. And then looking forward, every week now we've got literally millions of slots that are open and available for customers to select from, and we'll keep working on the things that can \u2013 we can do in the short-term to gain capacity. And the final thing I'd say is we are excited about what we would call Micro Fulfillment Center. So these would be automated solutions. There's a storage and retrieval system live at a storage a few miles from here that we're optimistic about, including others that are planned around the country for the next couple of years. So I think the ability for Walmart to be a real leader in the online pickup and delivery space is real. And I'm excited about the opportunities that has for us the next couple of years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Hey great. Great quarter guys. I'm sorry for the near-term question, but there's some news out there this morning from Amazon on the free two-day delivery on Rx. So I guess I'm curious what you think about this development? And if you could also remind us what percentage of your sales come from pharmacy? And I guess, bigger picture, how that business has trended recently in any tweaks you can make moving forward? John Furner : Hey, Chuck. I'll just say in general, we're very excited about health and wellness at Walmart. And health and wellness had a good \u2013 a great quarter last quarter, it was one of our best businesses. The team have opened a number of clinics and we have more plans or optimism about the health and wellness space remains high. Throughout the year we've been delivering prescriptions via mail. We've done this for some amount of time. And then we've expanded the capacity in the summer. So we've got really broad coverage on the ability to deliver prescriptions around the country. And then also during the pandemic in all stores \u2013 all supercenters that don't have a drive through, we also launched curbside pickup. So the customers who need their prescription could pick-up their prescription outside of the pharmacy. And then we've got 4,000 stores now in 30 States that have no contact delivery options. So the team has done a nice job innovating and serving the customer, and we just opened another central fill pharmacy here in Rogers, Arkansas that services home and stores. So we're pretty optimistic about the ability for the pharmacy team to continue to innovate and grow as the customer needs over the next couple of years. Doug McMillon : Sam's Club has been going through a similar innovation cycle during the pandemic, adding curbside, learning how to do delivery, things have all accelerated there. So kind of back to Peter's question earlier, we're building out an omni-channel health and wellness business, and it'll include the big pharmacy business that we have now, vision, hearing, OTC, the things that happen in-store and online, and then increasingly services as you can see through our additional clinics. So I think omni-channel, and health and wellness will matter every bit, as much as it does in the rest of retail. Doug McMillon : Are we wrapping up there? So just as we're wrapping up here, thank you for your questions. Really appreciate your interest in the company. We're optimistic about the fourth quarter. I love the position that we're in and just grateful to our associates for a strong Q3 and a strong year. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Dan Binder : Good morning and welcome to Walmart's 2021 Investment Community Meeting. Thank you all for joining us on the webcast. We appreciate your interest in Walmart. I know the executive team looks forward to sharing their strategies with you and answering your questions. Now, let me get a few of our usual statements out of the way. The information presented at today's meeting should be viewed in conjunction with our press release and earnings materials that can be found on our website, stock.walmart.com. The presentations will also be posted on our website as they are completed. Today's presentations include forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. Please reference our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations which are included with our earnings materials on our website, stock.walmart.com. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our earnings materials and guidance issued this morning. You can see today's agenda on your screen, and in a moment Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO will share some initial thoughts with you about our culture, our people and our opportunities. And then he'll be back to discuss Walmart's strategic objectives after you hear from our CFO, Brett Biggs. Brett will discuss Q4 results and fiscal year 2022 guidance and then we'll conduct our first of two Q&A sessions today. We'll have a brief 10 minute break following the Q&A session and then you will hear from several other leaders who will discuss our priorities and strategies across the business. Following these presentations, we will have another brief break and then we will conduct our second Q&A session. And at the end of that session, our formal meeting will conclude. With that, let's get things started. Doug McMillon : Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us for our 2021 investment community meeting. We are grateful for your interest in our company and for the confidence so many of you have in our future. We believe that confidence is well-founded and we are excited to give you an update on the opportunities we see ahead. I've been a part of Walmart for more than 30 years now and I can't remember a time when there was so much exciting change happening inside our company. The world around us is changing in big and important ways and I'm so encouraged by how our associates are leading and embracing change. We have a blend of experience and new thinking that are coming together to allow us to execute with more creativity and speed. We aren't the business we were just a few years ago, and we aren't the business you'll see in the years ahead; we are moving. David Glass was a CEO that followed Sam Walton. He led us into the food business and got us started outside the United States. In the 1990s I remember him telling us repeatedly that the company was just getting started. Every time I would hear him say it, I would think, really? We were already large by then, and so much had already happened. But today I can tell our associates the same thing; there is so much opportunity still in front of us. We have the talent, the culture, and the assets to thrive in the next generation of retail to invent it. We\u2019ve been building for this moment, and the moment is here. It's up to us. We can make it true that in 2021 this company was just getting started. I know many of you have been investing in and following Walmart for a long time and you know a lot about our company. This is a different business today and we are just getting started; we are moving. Looking back at 2020, I\u2019m so proud of how our big team has responded to the challenges. They just keep stepping up. It feels like our customers' and society have come to appreciate our associates more than usual, and that\u2019s well deserved. So many have been selfless and courageous. We\u2019ve tried to show our frontline associates in our stores, clubs, and supply chain our respect and gratitude with our words and our actions. They, along with our customers, our shareholders, our suppliers and partners, the communities we serve and the planet we seek to strengthen, shape our decisions. We take a multi stakeholder view because we know that mindset and approach deliver the most valuable, sustainable business over time. As for today, Brett will join us in a moment to talk about our results for the fourth quarter as well as to provide an outlook on our expectations for the next few years. I'll come back after his remarks to talk through the acceleration of our strategy and how we will deliver sustainable long-term growth. Then you will hear from several of our leaders about the specifics of our plan. I\u2019m confident you will leave this session with a clear understanding of a few key points. First, innovation and speed. It's time for us to dial-up our aggressiveness even more and go faster. Walmart is in a position of strength and we have momentum. Our confidence in our plan motivates us to accelerate and we will walk you through why we feel that way. Second, we are building a new customer-centric business model. Our customers welcome us serving them in new ways, and our assets and capabilities are being monetized in ways we haven't tapped into before. We have assets to leverage like our stores and supply chain, strengths like our store traffic and a brand trusted for value. We have foundational cornerstones like EDLP and EDLC. We can stay true to who we are and build on our strengths while building a mutually reinforcing flywheel. We are starting to drive the top and bottom line in more expansive ways. Our bottom line is becoming more diversified, which will enable us more operating income growth over time. We are repositioning to be in different businesses and exiting some geographies so resources are shifted to our priorities. We are building a better model, and it's uniquely Walmart. Third we will continue designing this business to create shared value for all our stakeholders. We are out to demonstrate that our company can do even more good for people as we grow; communities are strengthened, customers, associates, shareholders and suppliers benefit. Everyone wins. I will be back to share more specifics on the strategy in a few minutes. Now I would like to welcome Brett to add his view on the quarter and the future. Brett? Brett Biggs : Good morning and thanks, Doug. I\u2019ve been with Walmart for more than two decades and this is one of the most challenging and unique times we've all faced. However, it's also a time that presents great opportunities, and I'm looking forward to highlighting some of those for you this morning, I'm so proud of how our associates have responded in serving customers while accelerating our strategy. The recent progress in transforming Walmart into a truly omni-channel business prepared us for this period and it helped shape our future. This is an important moment for Walmart and we are ready. There are several things I want you to take away from this morning. First, we have great momentum. We just completed a year with record sales of $560 billion in constant currency including record fourth quarter sales of more than $150 billion and record operating cash flow of $36 billion. Profit growth was also strong, thanks to a number of things; strong sales, in particular improving general merchandise sales, improving eCommerce margins, and improved margin mix overall. Certainly we had tailwinds during the year, but we are performing extraordinarily well. This strong performance has allowed us to invest in the future of the business, invest in our associates, and give good returns to shareholders. From a position of great strength, we are now going to accelerate investments in supply chain, technology, automation, and our associates, allowing us to stay ahead of shifts in customer behavior. We strongly believe these investments will accelerate the company's top line and profit growth in the mid to long-term. Active portfolio management is also strengthening the model and focusing resources. And we remain laser focused on operating efficiency and delivering sustainable expense leverage. So let's turn to highlights of the fourth quarter and the year. During the year, we saw elevated sales levels related to customers stocking up, eating at home, entertaining and educating at home, and investing in home decor or their yards. And of course those things were supported by stimulus spending. In parallel, we had incremental COVID costs, some of which will continue. We had a strong holiday season followed by an acceleration in January. Total constant currency revenue was strong, increasing more than $10 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year. Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel grew 8.6% in both Q4 and for the year, including 79% annual growth in eCommerce. Walmart U.S. grew net sales by $29 billion for the year. Now for context, that is similar to the annual revenue of Dollar General and Starbucks. Sam's Club wrapped up a terrific year with full year comp sales growth of 15.8%, excluding fuel and tobacco and membership income increased more than 9%. On its own, Sam's Club would rank near the top 50 in the Fortune 500. Outside the US, sales increased 6.3% in constant currency for the quarter, including 60% eCommerce growth with strength in India, Mexico and Canada. Seven of nine markets posted positive comp sales, and for the year international net sales grew more than $6 billion in constant currency. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis declined about 3% in the quarter and was pressured by more than a $1 billion of incremental COVID expenses including associate bonuses, as well as a charge of around $220 million related to a decision to repay U.K property tax relief granted earlier in the year. The fourth quarter also included some increased tech expenses and increased wage pressure related to recently announced structure changes in Walmart U.S., as well as additional head count to ensure our holiday season was a success, which it was. Excluding the U.K charge, total company adjusted operating income would have increased. Despite various headwinds, Walmart U.S. adjusted operating income increased 6.5% on solid gross margin improvement and continued reduction in eCommerce losses, as well as some benefit related to timing of allocations. For the year, adjusted operating income increased over 9% in constant currency with each segment growing significantly despite more than $4 billion of incremental COVID costs. Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.39, but would have been about $0.37 higher if not for COVID costs and the U.K property tax repayment. GAAP EPS was a $0.74 loss, significantly impacted by the loss on businesses in the U.K and Japan as both are classified as assets held for sale that's partially offset by an unrealized gain in our investment in JD.com, the value of which has increased by $9 billion since our initial investment. Operating cash flow for the year was exceptionally strong at $36 billion, and the company returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So in summary, it was a great year financially and on an underlying basis, it was a strong finish. Let's now talk about how we plan to continue the strong momentum. Because of our financial strength, competitive position and ability to execute, we're in a unique position to continue innovating and serving customers in multiple ways. Over the past several years we've made great progress building an ecosystem of synergistic assets, and we've made strategic choices like reducing exposure to lower growth international markets while focusing on higher growth opportunities in the U.S., Mexico, and India. Now is the time to play even more aggressive offense. We are winning, and we intend to keep pushing the ball aggressively down the field. Over the next few years we are going to step up capital investment primarily in the U.S to improve the customer experience, support growth, and drive efficiencies. I will give you some highlights and you will hear more as the morning progresses. As I mentioned earlier, our revenue grew $40 billion last year, putting us at least a year ahead of where we thought we might be. So we need to lean in more aggressively in key markets with increased capital and fulfillment capacity, supply chain, automation, and technology. This new infrastructure will allow us to expand eCommerce assortment, enabling us to reduce both shipping time and cost. We will step up automation in DCs to deliver aisle and department-ready pallets, stores. We will continue to refresh our existing stores by enhancing pickup and delivery capacity, merchandising programs and efficiency initiatives. In India we see significant growth opportunities for Flipkart and PhonePe. It's exciting to see the emerging middle class rapidly adopting eCommerce and using their mobile phones to use money transfer, insurance, and other services. Meanwhile, we will step up technology investments to continue upgrading legacy enterprise systems and customer facing technology. We are on a multiyear journey of modernizing our tech stack and capabilities to increase the efficient use of the cloud and simplify customer and associate experiences. As we accelerate investment, CapEx is expected to be around $14 billion this year with most of the increase versus last year in the U.S. Over the next few years, we expect CapEx to be around 2.5% to 3% of sales. While this is higher than the past few years, it is far below the CapEx peak of 4% to 5% of sales during the period of heavy supercenter growth. This spend will allow us to fully optimize our strategy, and in turn accelerate the company's top line and profit growth rates in the mid to long-term. After a year or so of transition, these investments should put us in position for 4% plus sales growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales. 4% top line growth would basically be the equivalent of adding a Fortune 100 company every year. Our unique financial strength allows us to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders while growing the business. And as you saw this morning, we increased our dividend for the 48th consecutive year and we authorized a new $20 billion share repurchase program, which we plan to execute over the next three years or so. There are so many initiatives underway that give us confidence that these are the right investments at the right time. We are already seeing proof points, and you'll hear more about these later on. We expect continued strong growth in the U.S businesses and expect even higher international growth rates as we focus on key markets and making money in new ways. We will continue improving margin mix through an enhanced general merchandise offering, new brands and marketplace growth with a greater push towards expanding fulfillment and other services for sellers. We will drive existing and new customer growth through initiatives like Walmart+. We will grow sales and profit increasingly with growing higher margin businesses in advertising, financial services, marketplace, health care services and the like. Our operating discipline will continue to sharpen. After a pause in FY '22 primarily because of additional wage investments, I expect expense leverage to continue at or above 20 basis points a year. Let me turn now specifically to our expectations for this current year. We feel very good about the underlying business and ability to compete from a position of strength. However, we are still facing similar COVID-related challenges, absolutely have over the past several quarters which caused us to suspend guidance, and continues to make short-term guidance very challenging. Despite that we want to give you the best view we can at this time given what we know and what we see right now. We know we will have both headwinds and tailwinds this year, the balance and degree of which isn't clear. As the year progresses, we hope to get more clarity around COVID impacts, vaccine efficacy and availability, the scale and duration of economic stimulus and the mid-term economic climate globally. Even if conditions stay generally similar to now, for any length of time this year and with limited additional stimulus, we would expect continued solid underlying performance from Walmart U.S. with low single-digit comps and continued solid eCommerce sales growth. Low single-digit comps would result in around a 10% comp growth on a 2-year stack basis. So, very healthy growth. We would expect the level of comp growth to be more heavily weighted toward the middle of the year as a result of the timing of COVID-related demand and stimulus in FY '21. Now of course that could look different depending on future stimulus and/or significant changes in customer spending patterns as the COVID crisis hopefully moderates at some point. The comparisons against last year are unique. There were stretches that were really strong and others less so, driven by how people responded to the virus, how they stocked up, how they responded to being at home more, and of course stimulus actions. In International, excluding divestitures, we expect to see higher level of sales growth versus the U.S with strength in India, Mexico, and China. And at Sam's we expect low single-digit comps, excluding fuel and tobacco. Total company sales are expected to decline, due primarily to the divestiture or anticipated divestitures of businesses in the U.K., Japan, and Argentina. Excluding that, we would expect total company sales to grow in the low single digits. From a profitability standpoint, given the assumptions mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of divestitures, we would expect operating income and EPS to be flat to up slightly versus a very strong profit year in FY '21. In regards to the U.K transaction, when we announced it, we said we expected EPS dilution of approximately $0.25 in the first full year assuming we held proceeds in cash. We expect to hold more cash than normal during this time due to strong cash flow, but plan to reallocate that cash in a thoughtful way in the coming quarters into new projects as well as share repurchase. We still expect to make up for the EPS hit in the mid-term, but there will be timing impacts that negatively affect FY 2022 EPS by about $0.20. However, this should provide a tailwind to EPS growth in future years as we reallocate more of that cash. Due in large part to the International transactions, we expect operating income dollars and EPS to decline slightly in FY '22 on a consolidated basis, but we expect Walmart U.S. operating income to increase in spite of some continued COVID costs, accelerated technology costs and increased wages. Alternative revenue streams like advertising and Walmart Fulfillment Services are gaining traction and are expected to become a larger portion of profit growth in the future including FY '22 along with a fairly steady gross margin rate. Due to the International transactions and FY '21 COVID-related expense and profit timing, we expect the FY '22 quarterly profit growth cadence versus last year to be quite variable. We expect Q1 operating income to be relatively flat to last year and EPS to be flat to slightly up, reflecting the presence of Asda in our financials for about half the quarter and some tax rate fluctuations. Due to the timing of FY '21 cost and divestitures, Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS may be down mid to even high single digits, with Q4 operating income and EPS potentially up mid to high single digits. Again, and I probably can't stress this enough, we are in a very unusual time, causing projections even in the short-term to be very challenging and open to significant fluctuation. Many times I get asked by analysts, investors and others, are we missing anything about Walmart. And I've thought a lot about this question lately. And even for someone like me that's been here for over 20 years, I have to step back and see the evolution through a different lens. Walmart's different than it was last year, three years ago, and certainly five years ago; its faster, its more creative and its less risk averse. It's actively creating its future by building on a set of unique strengths and capabilities. Let me describe the Walmart I want you to see. We have more customer store traffic than anyone in the world. We have one of, if not the largest pickup businesses in the world. And we are scaling delivery. We are one of the largest eCommerce companies in the world, approaching $100 billion in revenue in the next couple of years, and we believe $200 billion a few years after that. We have one of the largest marketplace businesses in the world, and now we are scaling a marketplace fulfillment services business to grow even faster. We are majority owner of one of the most successful retailers in the world, Walmex, with over $50 billion market cap with great growth opportunities. In India, we are majority owner of one of the largest eCommerce and payment businesses in one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world. We have a $75 billion club business globally, one of the fastest growing segments in the retail industry. And it's a winner in three key markets; in the U.S., Mexico, and China. We have a rapidly growing advertising platform, which should be a multibillion dollar business in the very near future. We are a global leader in supply chain innovation with exciting initiatives on the table. We are a global leader in sustainability with a clear aspirational goal to become regenerative. We have both growth and scale. We reduced our exposures in Brazil, Argentina, the U.K., Japan, and we will still have a top line that's over $0.5 trillion. That's the Walmart I want to make sure you see. This is the time for us to accelerate and we are ready. And as always, I thank you for your interest in Walmart. And I will turn it over to Doug. Doug McMillon : Thank you, Brett. Thank you for your leadership and partnership. We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the year. Growth was strong across the company. Innovation and speed picked up. We moved quickly to add new capabilities to protect the health of our associates, serve customers and members safely in our stores and clubs and serve them with more capacity for pickup and delivery. We found ways to support the explosive growth in eCommerce and learned how to hire people in hours rather than days, which enabled hundreds of thousands of people to get work when they really needed it and when we really needed them. We managed our business well in an unpredictable environment, but we certainly didn't get everything right. Given supply constraints, our in-stock suffered significantly during portions of the year. Store standards were impacted. We would reduce store hours and limit customer density all over again, but that did impact our sales. Those realities should provide some upside in 2021 as we lap the extraordinarily strong results of last year. I want to thank our associates around the world. They have been courageous. They are adapting to change. They worked really hard to overcome the hurdles presented by one of the most difficult periods in history, and I know they'll continue to do so. The challenges of the past year came in different forms and weren't limited to the health crisis. We are all aware of the difficult social, political and economic realities that we face. These are deep-rooted problems that we all have to tackle. As for Walmart, we will continue to be part of the solutions. As it relates to the health crisis, we helped with PPE for healthcare workers and stood up COVID testing sites. We donated more than 625 million pounds of food and over $55 million in grants for hunger relief in 2020. Now, we are supporting the country in the vaccination effort. As it relates to the financial crisis, we will help with employment and we will help small businesses by buying their goods, building an expanded marketplace for sellers and as Sam's Club serves family-owned restaurants and other small businesses. Small businesses are vital to our economy. When it comes to the social and political challenges we all face, we will engage in public conversations in ways that are thoughtful, constructive and in line with our values. We are committed to racial equity. We will keep changing inside our company and find ways to leverage our business and influence to shape systems extending beyond our company. This work is important to me and it's important to our associates, including our leadership, and we know it's strategic. Being diverse and inclusive is smart business. 2020 not only confirmed our strategy, it accelerated it by fast-forwarding many of the customer trends we've been building towards. We feel emboldened and are now moving with even more speed and aggressiveness. We are scaling new capabilities and businesses and designing them to work together in a mutually reinforcing way. As we imagine the future, we believe people, our customers, families will want an even better value for their money; a merchandise assortment that is relevant to their life and seems limitless; services that help them save time, save money and get or stay healthy; an experience that is easy and enjoyable. And the knowledge that the company they do business with can be trusted to treat everyone in their supply chain well and take actions that strengthen our planet. In the future, people will still want to shop in compelling stores, but more and more, there will be occasions where they prefer to pick up an order or have it delivered. Some customers will eventually allow us and pay us to keep them replenished in their homes on the items they routinely purchase. For an increasing number of customers, Walmart will be seen more like a service. Customers will think of us as the merchant that serves their wants and needs, but in ways that take less time and effort. We won't just be utilitarian for them. We will serve up items and ideas that are relevant and exciting. We will reach them directly and through other platforms. Our customer relationships will continue to broaden and deepen in health and wellness and financial services. Our customers view these as natural and expected components of their Walmart experience. We will weave all these things together in a seamless way. So we are in an early stage of building a new business model that will enable us to serve people how they want to be served in any particular moment and thrive in the next generation of retail as a business. Over time, we believe the big winners in retail will be those that deliver a unique interrelated ecosystem. Many of you will remember the original Walmart productivity loop. We lowered prices, grew sales and leveraged expenses. Some of you will remember the ecosystem chart we shared in 2018. While we continue to learn, our thinking moves on and so we'd like to share today's version as a way to describe our emerging business model. It should help you better understand how we will serve customers and drive sustainable, diversified operating income growth over time. As I describe it, some of my comments are specific to the U.S., but you should think of this as applying in all of our priority markets around the world. Think about it as a flywheel that's spinning, powered by a mutually reinforcing set of assets. We start with the customer in the center. We are designing for them. Our relationship with them is founded on our ability to provide them the lowest prices on the items they buy all the time. They come to our stores and our app to get the things they want or need. Our first priority is to continue to earn their business when it's time to buy the big basket, the stock up trip, to be the best and first place they shop. We do that well with the supercenter format. Having a broad assortment so close to 90% of America is an advantage. As we've added pickup and delivery capabilities, we've experienced a lot of growth, but too often, we aren't able to meet the demand. This is a good problem to have, but we need to solve it quickly, given how trends accelerated as a result of the pandemic. So we are going to invest more aggressively in capacity and automation to position ourselves to earn the primary destination position with customers. We are absolutely playing offense here. Customers can choose to visit a store, pick up their order, have it delivered, have it delivered into a secure box on their front step, into a garage refrigerator, or all the way into their kitchen, even when they're not at home. When you hear us say delivery, define that as the combination of delivery from our stores, clubs and eCommerce fulfillment centers. Our customers and members are indifferent as to whether their delivered items come from a store or an FC. So we can optimize for speed and costs behind the scenes as we meet or exceed customer expectations. Over time, more and more of our customers will want Walmart+ because it makes life better. That relationship will drive repeat business and provide data that enables us to serve them even better and be more personalized. It's an important piece of our strategy. For now, we are focused on continuing a high quality experience for Walmart+ members as we add capacity. Over time, we will add more benefits to the membership to broaden its appeal. Moving to 3 o'clock on the wheel, the demand we've been experiencing in general merchandise is amazing. Beyond the pandemic, our eCommerce business will continue to grow at a fast pace. We expect our eCommerce sales globally to be over $100 billion in the next couple of years. We continue to add assortment and brands. Our emphasis here is on general merchandise. We've got a lot of upside in apparel, home and hardlines. To capture that upside, we're going to pull forward investments in space and automation. As our fulfillment capacity grows, we'll use it to improve the customer experience, expand our first-party assortment, grow our marketplace and build our fulfillment services business, which is scaling nicely. Beyond selling merchandise, we can do more to serve the healthcare needs of families. They want and need high quality preventative, accessible and affordable health care. They want and need high-quality, preventative, accessible and affordable health care. As you evaluate our opportunity in health care, consider not only our pharmacy, optical, hearing and OTC businesses, but also consider our position as the country's largest seller of food and how that relates to health. Our locations, which enable access; our large stores and large parking lots, which give us room to expand; our experience with the associate benefits, where we cover a lot of lives; and our growing digital capabilities; together they create the opportunity for a differentiated omni-channel health care business that helps a lot of people. We aren't starting from scratch. We are convinced our customers want this and they trust us to provide it. Financial services are also a way we can help make daily life better for customers. Last month, we announced the formation of a new FinTech startup, designed to develop and offer innovative and affordable financial solutions. Our customers have been clear that they want more from us in terms of financial services and this new approach will help us deliver for them in a differentiated way more quickly. For a FinTech startup, customer acquisition costs are high and our platform lowers those costs. We have a head start. Moving to 6 o'clock on the wheel, our purpose is to save money and help people live better. So we must operate at a lower cost and do it in a way that's sustainable. As you know, we've had several automation tests going on. I'm very pleased to share a few of the most important forms are now ready to scale. These investments will enable us to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. Our digital transformation continues. Our way of working, our use of data and the modernization of our tech stack continue. Earlier I mentioned diversifying our profit base. Scaling new profit pools is a priority. Big marketplace and fulfillment services, advertising, financial services, data monetization and last-mile delivery; these are all early stage businesses that are scaling or are positioned to scale. The resulting more diversified model will allow us to sustainably reinvest back into the customer value proposition and choose how much flows through into profit. As I walked through the flywheel, I mentioned several investments. Based on everything I've learned over the years and the opportunity I see looking ahead, this is the right time to make these investments. The strategy, team and capabilities are in place. We know where the customer's going. We have momentum and our balance sheet is strong. Here's what we see. First, the combination of stores and eCommerce is a winner. Last year, step changed our eCommerce business and our stores are an asset. We have demand and need more space earlier than we had planned a year ago. Given the delivery is a key driver of Walmart+, we need more capacity to grow Walmart+ with a high Net Promoter Score. Second, our automation plan is now ready to scale. We will be investing in our distribution centers, our eCommerce fulfillment centers and in-market fulfillment centers, which will in many cases be inside of or built beside our stores. John will tell you more about what this means for our U.S business. Those investments will enable productivity improvements for years to come. They have a nice IRR. Big picture, think of our U.S supply chain with hundreds of distribution and fulfillment centers, thousands of stores and clubs so close to so many people, functioning in a hybrid fashion, automated where they should be based on volumes and complemented with onsite market fulfillment centers or offsite MFCs where we see incremental demand. Importantly, imagine our supply chain is interconnected so the cost to meet or exceed customer expectations is optimized. And imagine our growing network with a next-gen level of automation. I think the next few years will represent more change in our supply chain than even the grocery DC rollout we did to support supercenters. It's really exciting. We will keep investing in store remodels so that our stores are fresh and appealing. We will also continue to invest in our people. Last fall, we changed the structure in our U.S stores leaning even more into teams. At that time, we gave a raise to 165,000 people. And now, we will be raising wages for 425,000 more. These are investments in people that are important to our future, because they provide a great pickup, delivery and in-store experience for our customers. These investments are part of a strategy we pursued since I started in this role. We've increased our starting wages by more than 50% since 2015. Once these increases are implemented, approximately half of our U.S hourly associates, about 730,000 people will earn at least $15 an hour. Our average wage in the U.S will be at least $15.25 per hour. Our supply chain associates are already earning $15 or more and we've made additional wage investments in Sam's Club over the last few years. Importantly, in addition to hourly wage rates, we will continue investing to provide career opportunities through our internal education programs and access to affordable degrees. Because of technology, the future of work will be different and we want to prepare our associates for that journey. We believe we should do more than provide just an hourly wage. Bonuses for some roles, our 401(k) match, stock ownership plan, affordable health care and other components are smart investments. We will make these investments in our supply chain and people, while also staying on track to modernize our technology. To pay for all that, we will keep growing sales, expand our general merchandise business and scale mutually reinforcing and profitable businesses. The guidance that Brett provided this morning includes these investments for these areas I've just described. One way to think about us is to recognize our people and physical assets as strategic moats and realize that we're changing how we think and work to build digital products and related businesses that complement those assets and have helpful margins; marketplace, advertising and membership income, for example. We aren't strangers to membership. Sam's Club in the U.S., China and Mexico is performing very well and that performance accelerated during 2020. Sam's is innovating, adding new capabilities and improving our merchandise offer, especially in fresh food and with our Member's Mark private brand. Sam's is a big business for us and it has strong momentum. As I mentioned before, this mutually reinforcing flywheel concept applies in our priority markets outside the U.S. Specific elements of the flywheel, such as pickup and delivery, eCommerce and marketplace, fulfillment services, payment and other financial services and advertising have application in Mexico, Canada, India and China. The same flywheel assets are adapted to be relevant to the specific needs of the customer in each market and to leverage our different operating models. Let me focus on Mexico and India for a minute. We see an opportunity to grow eCommerce market share in Mexico. Our stores business is strong and an omni-channel approach will be a winner in this market. Our Walmex team has done a great job of growing eCommerce, including a strong same-day delivery option from stores and clubs. The pandemic had a similar impact to customer trends in Mexico as it did in the U.S. So, now the next step for us is to leverage the momentum we have to grow 1P and 3P eCommerce through investments and technology, supply chain and customer acquisition. The team is building alternative income streams to complement our traditional retail business, including advertising. In India, our momentum and potential for growth make this a unique opportunity; eCommerce penetration still low, but growing rapidly. We are well-positioned to grow as an emerging middle-class spends more money through their mobile phones. Like the U.S and Mexico, this is a market where we will step on the gas to ensure we have the appropriate level of investment in areas like supply chain. The PhonePe business continues to grow and perform very well. These are homegrown businesses with innovation and problem solving for the Indian customer at their core. We continue to be impressed with Flipkart and PhonePe talent led by Kalyan and Sameer. You will hear from them along with Judith in a little while. I've talked a lot about investing for growth and I also think it's important for us to call out the areas where we are narrowing our focus and making choices. We are deploying capital to areas where we see the best opportunity for growth while pulling back in other areas. Over the last few years, you've seen us divest restaurants and apparel specialty chain, banks, Vudu and eCommerce businesses and brands along with markets like Brazil and Argentina. We\u2019ve announced new ownership structures in the U.K and Japan moving us to a minority position. We\u2019ve executed these decisions to narrow our focus while also developing important partnerships to drive growth like those with JD.com, Tata, Aditya Birla Fashion Retailer and Ninjacart. We are being deliberate about where we invest, where we divest and where we partner. We are a good partner and we are flexible. In order for us to pull all of these work streams together into a cohesive, well-executed strategy, the organization has to think and work in new ways. Think about it as an enabler of our strategy, whether it's moving to an agile way of working, prioritizing digital acumen and diversity in our talent base, or developing new ownership structures around the world, we will function in a way that supports innovation, speed and productivity. Our product teams and technologists are working hand-in-hand with business leaders every day to develop and deploy the right products at the right time for our customers and associates. The tech team we've assembled is working to take our technology to the next level. We will do the things I've described while staying true to our purpose and our core values and while taking a shared value approach. The best way to create a valuable company is to build for the long-term, manage the short-term and serve all the relevant stakeholders. So we are systems thinkers. We connect dots. We design sustainability into our holistic supply chain and save money doing it by eliminating waste. Environmental, social and governance issues aren't side projects. They are strategic, core and part of our culture as aspirations push us beyond sustainability. This is a holistic approach that supports and replenishes humanity and nature. Regeneration means renewing and replenishing in addition to preserving and doing less harm. Our target of zero emissions by 2040 with no offsets is an ambitious and motivating challenge. We believe it's important to push toward zero in our own operations, even where it's difficult and may not be feasible with current technology. Our push will help drive necessary innovation. We will lead where we can and help make possible what's not currently possible. Climate change remains at the forefront of our ambitions on regeneration, and you've heard us talk many times about Project Gigaton and our efforts to reduce emissions in the supply chain of our business and those of our suppliers. To date, suppliers have reported a cumulative 375 million metric tons of avoided emissions. We are well on our way to our goal of avoiding 1 billion metric tons of emissions. In summary, we are confident in our strategy. Now is the time for us to be aggressive. Speed matters. We are going to keep the customer in the center and design for them. The new business model we are building will allow us to thrive to reinvent. There is so much opportunity in front of us. Our associates, including our leadership, are the reason we have so much confidence. Sam Walton was described as a merchant with a servant's heart. Our associates are continuing that legacy. Thank you for your attention. In a moment, we will begin the first of two Q&A sessions. Brett and I will take your questions about what we've shared so far and then you will hear more from the team. Dan Binder : Thank you for joining our Q&A session this morning. As a reminder, if you have a question, please click Raise Hand. You can find this under the Reactions or Participants button. When the host calls upon you, click the Unmute button that will appear on your screen and then you may ask your question. We will take a moment. Our first question will come from Peter Benedict at R.W. Baird. And after that, we will go to Paul Trussell. Peter? Peter Benedict : Okay. Dan, thanks. Can you hear me? Doug McMillon : Yes, we got you. Dan Binder : Yes. Peter Benedict : Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks. So, I guess two-part question here. First, just on the higher capital spend, maybe can you tease that out a little bit more, Brett, maybe some of the components there, what areas of the business are getting how much? And then, as you think beyond this year, you talked about the 2.5% to 3% of sales. Are there certain areas that will get more of that versus less, kind of what's the -- what continues beyond this year? And I guess, related to that, on the U.S wage investment, where do you think your U.S associate base should all be making at least $15 an hour, is there a timeframe we should be thinking about for that? Thank you. Brett Biggs : Yes. Peter, thanks. I will kick off. So on capital, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we're going to lean into the places that we're going -- that we've talked about from a strategic standpoint really for several years, but definitely this morning. So we are leaning more particularly on supply chain and eCommerce. Peter, you've been following the company for a long time, if you go back several years, we were spending 50%, 60% or more of capital on new stores. Now that's turning toward ensuring we have the right amount of capacity we need to fulfill the customers' desires as much as the way that they want to be fulfilled, but then also getting it to customers more quickly. Those are the kind of things that we're going to be focused on. And innovation, there're so many things that are going on from innovation standpoint in supply chain, and we've been on the front edge of that, Doug, and thinking about how we get pallets to the stores and how we make it easier to pick in the backrooms. And those are the kind of things over the next few years where you're going to continue to see us lean in, and globally, not just in the U.S. Doug McMillon : Yes. Good morning, Peter. I will just add that I'm really excited that we're now to the point where we can invest in some of this automation. I know you've been following us closely. We've been working on this for a while. And now we've got these various forms, distribution center technology, fulfillment center technology, store level market fulfillment center technology that we can start to really scale. And that will take a few years to roll that out, but we like the customer experience benefits, we like the productivity improvements that we're going to see. And this year just really fast-forwarded things in terms of customer behavior. We think the vast majority of that behavior is going to last. And it's terrific that the automation we've been working on is now ready. Maybe if anything I wish it'd been ready a year ago, but at least we're there now and we can get going on it. So, I'm really excited about that. As it relates to associate wages, the approach that we have been trying to take for years now is to make sure that we are creating this ladder of opportunity, providing an opportunity for people when they start with the company to build a career, like so many of us have. And so, the investments that we're making right now are aimed at this new structure that we put in place. It's even more of a team approach to getting the work done across the store that needs to get done. Obviously, picking in the store has become really important. Managing inventory is obviously really important. And this new structure is going to help us do those things more effectively. And those people that we are raising wages for tend to have been with us for a longer period of time than someone that might be earning the entry wage. And so, we're trying to move that average up, create that ladder, and continue to have associates that come through our system and become store managers. We've got about 75% of our store management that starts as hourlies. The alternative would be to invest all of that to try and get to $15 faster, but if we do that, then we wouldn't be able to create this succession that we're committed to creating. We will raise our starting wage rate over time, and I think our history proves that. I mean, we've gone since 2015 from $9 to $10 to $11, we are up over 50% in our starting wage rate. And we will be sensitive to geographies, on their parts of the country where the starting wage should be lower than others and we're obviously really well aware of what's happening nationally with this discussion around $15. And I think that that\u2019s an important target, but I also think that that should be paced in a way that's good for the U.S economy. And you can kind of see us as a model working through how that works. But, I'm really excited to raise the wages today for so many people. Dan Binder : Great. Thank you, Peter. We will go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank next, and then Karen Short after that. Paul Trussell : Good morning. Thank you for the color and especially for the willingness to provide guidance in a volatile and dynamic backdrop, and guidance is really where my questions lie. Brett, to the extent you can dig deeper, can you just help us a little bit more on some of the many moving parts in looking at your fiscal '22, just how best we should think about the impact of the U.K., Argentina, Japan, wage investment, COVID costs, just as best as you know today? And then, Doug, as you kind of still expect the top line in the U.S to remain positive despite the tough compares, just discuss what\u2019s driving that confidence and what the digital contribution to that growth looks like? Brett Biggs : Yes. Paul, it's good to see you. You almost answered your question as that's how you're asking the question. As we were talking through, as you can imagine, we're talking through wanting to give guidance this year because it's -- we want to give you the best view that we have right now, knowing everything that we know. But we know less than we typically do in a normal year about what's going to happen with the vaccine, what's going to happen with economies, what's going to happen in other parts of what's going on. So, we've tried to raise up the guidance a little bit and to be fair to give you just a -- give you a little more high level guidance than we have, and so, getting to the individual pieces and talking about any of those specifics would be pretty challenging. But if you look at even the top line guidance, we've given you as close as we can without divestitures or excluding divestitures, so we're trying to give you apples-to-apples. And so, with that, we think low single-digit growth for the company and Walmart U.S. is possible. You got stimulus plans and other things that are sitting out there. But even with that, Walmart U.S. would have a 10% to your stack. So, it would be very, very healthy growth. Same thing on the EPS and operating income. We're trying to give you apples-to-apples as if Asda in Japan and all that are still in the business, obviously there's not, and there will be an impact top line and bottom line from that. I know you appreciate the situation that all of us are in with COVID and we wanted to give you as good as guidance as we could right now. Doug McMillon : As it relates to U.S growth, Paul, obviously there's a lot of variance week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to- quarter, and I'm sure every retailer, and we certainly did, kept a really good diary about what was happening every day as we went through that year. And just looking back on all the things that happened even in February and March a year ago is a long list of activities, things that occurred in the environment and decisions that we made. Many of those decisions restricted sales in our stores. We changed hours. We metered how many people could be in the store. And obviously, we were hit hard from an in-stock point of view. Normally, it's a great thing to have inventory turns and we were managing our supply chain well, but we didn't have these huge stockpiles sitting to the side for the surges that we saw on things like consumables. So, I would never seen anything like what happened in our stores as we went through the year. And it was a real challenge for our associates, our store managers, our assistant managers, our associates deserve so much credit for being able to adapt. Some of them were on leave. We had people join the company. We hired over 0.5 million people during the course of last year to help fill in for those on leave and to react to the additional demand that we had for pick and delivery. So, imagine being a store manager dealing with a lot of associates without much experience. So, we've got all these things underneath the surface; in-stock, store hours, associates that were less experienced. All of those factors cause us to think. If things continue to improve, the vaccine roll-out continues, people start to come back out, people will come back to Walmart that may have been shopping locally because they were trying to manage the COVID situation carefully. We've talked about our market shares as we've gone through the year. We think we've got an opportunity in food and consumables to grow market share this next year. So, those are the kinds of things that cause us to feel like it's appropriate to forecast that increase in sales and then go earn it. There will be a lot of volatility quarter-by-quarter and we will just do the best job we can, Paul, of explaining what we're seeing as we go through it. Dan Binder : Thank you, Paul. Next, we will go to Karen Short with Barclays, and then to Simeon Gutman after that. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me? Doug McMillon : Hi, Karen. Karen Short : Hey, there. Yes. Thanks so much for all the color. Really helpful. I wanted to just -- one clarification, just on the EPS. So we used $5.28 as the base, correct, in terms of flat to slightly up. But then, the bigger question I had it was just on the U.S operating profit in general. So, when I kind of do back of the envelope math on the employees getting the wage increase, I get kind of close to 14% impact to operating profit in the U.S. And you've obviously guided to slightly up operating profit in the U.S. So, maybe can you parse that out a little bit more, because that seems -- and I know you've guided to up sales, so -- or up comps in the U.S., so that's a component of it. But maybe a little color on that, because that 14% hit, it seems like a fairly large lump to overcome to still have the U.S be up? Brett Biggs : Sure. I will walk you through that. So, on the EPS, you're correct, the $0.20 that we talked about is related to Asda. There will still be a little bit of impact from Japan because that is accretive as well, assuming we get that transaction closed in the next few weeks. But the way you did your math would be accurate. On the U.S., there's a lot changing in the P&L and one of the things over the last several years is we've had gross margin that has decreased fairly significantly as we've invested in price and done other things. Now, as we have price gaps in a pretty good position certainly versus where they were years ago; the way that we're able to move product, we're getting efficiencies there, the new income streams that you see us having; the general merchandise business, which is improved, that's helps mix; eCommerce contribution margin, that continues to prove, all of that helps gross margin. So in the past where you're starting with gross margin going down fairly significantly at times, that's really not the case probably as we look forward. So on the expense side, do you have increased wages, but you also had significant COVID costs this year and other things that hit the expense line. But when you balance all of that out and again, Karen, we are giving you the best view that we can, we do think that Walmart U.S. can continue to grow operating income, but there's just a lot of things inside of that. Doug McMillon : It's helpful to have the eCommerce improvements that we saw. Brett mentioned the contribution profit improvement. That's driven through apparel and home mix and other things, including the fact that we finally put our merchant teams together. And John and Marc worked really well with the merchants, Scott McCall and others, to help people come on board and take on that additional responsibility in a way that's been helpful. And then, the volume growth leverages fixed costs in a different way. So as you've heard over and over again, a lot of things just got fast-forwarded and changed and changed the shape of what we're looking at. Brett Biggs : And the additional revenue streams that we've been talking about, we will talk about even more this morning, advertising, financial services, marketplace, those things that really weren't large businesses at all, they're growing and they're scaling and they're becoming a bigger part of the Walmart U.S. P&L. So that's a positive. Thank you. Dan Binder : Thank you, Karen. Next, we will go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley and then we will go to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Doug McMillon : Hey, Simeon. Simeon Gutman : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'll first have may be a two parter for Doug and then a one part for you, Brett. Doug, you mentioned balancing and managing all the interests of stakeholders and you guys have done a good job of that over the last few years. So this is the, why not invest more upfront in this year, how much of a debate is that? And then, can you tell us how much of this investment plan is new or is it pulling forward what would have been a 5 or 10-year plan? And then, to you, Brett, thinking about fiscal '23 and beyond, I realize you gave a construct, is the leverage point of the business or again, of the retail business increasing such that you can't get higher incremental margins over time? And for some of those things you just mentioned, plus advertising, it seems like the incremental margins should get better, especially as you invest in supply chain and get more efficient. But you said, roughly, in line EBIT growth to sales, I'm sure it's far out and so you're being careful, but why shouldn't we expect higher incrementals over time? Brett Biggs : You may start. Do you want to \u2026? Doug McMillon : I will go first. Brett Biggs : Okay. Doug McMillon : When you think about why not more, the two pieces that go through my mind are the automation investments and then the wage investment. On the automation side, I think we're going as quickly and as aggressively as we can and should go. These things will take some time. If we find that it's working really well and we can go faster, I'm going to be in the camp of wanting to go faster, because this looks like it's going be really great for our supply chain, great for customers, great for the company from a financial point of view. On the wage side, we've been on a path, we've got a strategy, we've got a plan, and we are executing that plan. And you'll just see us continue to make investments at the right time we think in the right levels while also investing in automation to help with productivity. We are trying to play a harmony here and balance these things together. And one things I'm excited about, by the way, is that as we've been changing, we've been able to add a lot of jobs, which I think is great. It's great for the economy. It's great for people to have employment. And automation historically tends to change work and create new opportunities. And I think that's what we're seeing. I mean, a number of people that we've hired to pick orders in stores and a number of people that we will need to run the automation investments that we are making, there's going to be opportunity for folks. And we are trying to craft this whole approach with not only hourly wages, but what we do with benefits and incentives, what we do with health care, what we do with 401(k) match and all of those things to retain people in a way that you get the highest level of productivity, because people are brought in on what the company is doing. So we think we are doing this strategically at the right pace, as it relates to the wage investments. So I think the one place where we could go faster if it all works is automation, and it is a pull forward. We were planning on doing these things. I think two things happened. One is the pandemic changed behavior faster than we would have had in our model. And then, secondly, it just so happens that two or three of these kind of came together in a way that they're ready to be scaled at the same time, and that's great. Brett Biggs : Yes, Simeon, the way you think about the profit algorithm is right. And I said in my comments that this company looks pretty different than 5 years ago and 5 years from now it's going to look different again. And the comment I made in the remarks was that I do think operating income should grow faster than sales. And as an executive team, as we talk through these investments, when making these investments that's what we think we should do. And when you look at the -- our ability to generate revenue and profit in different ways, if you look at general merchandise business that's growing and changes the mix, as you look at contribution margins in eCommerce changing, all of that lead you to believe that operating income can grow faster than sales in the mid to long-term, and that's what we expect to do as a company. Doug McMillon : Absolutely. We want that to happen. We think that will happen. We've got a path to make that happen. And it's cool that it's happening in a different way that's sustainable and more digital in nature. I mean, we've become more of a digital company, and that's important in the way that customers live and work and behave these days and the way you can stitch things together. I remember growing up watching other retailers, Sears comes to mind, that diversified, and learning in business school, that there were mistakes made. And looking at what's happening today and what we are trying to do, the thing that's different is technology, the internet is different, digital is different, the way you can stitch these things together is different. And when I look at the flywheel that we showed you a few minutes ago, I get really excited about the arrows that connect the dots. If we can design these things in a way that we become more of a default for certain aspects of their life because of the way we've intuitively designed things, that\u2019s where the magic can really happen. And that is possible today because of digital and technology when it wasn't years ago. Doug McMillon : CFOs don't get excited very often, but as I see this business model shaping up, it is really exciting. It's a really different look to the company, that\u2019s great. Doug McMillon : It doesn't feel like we're getting too far away from core. Brett Biggs : Yes, still within the core. Doug McMillon : I'm not worried -- yes. Brett Biggs : Yes, that's what's so exciting about it. Doug McMillon : And we've got a team today that thinks that way. Brett Biggs : Yes. Doug McMillon : Some of the talent that's been with us for a long time as well as some new folks. Dan Binder : Thanks, Simeon. Next, we will go to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim, and then to Steph Wissink with Jefferies following that. Robert Drbul : Good morning, guys. I just had a couple of questions. I think the first one, on the flywheel, Doug, you talked about the flywheel a little bit, can you just talk about how you think it will evolve with the new businesses that you're adding beyond what you showed today? Can we start with that one? Doug McMillon : Well, Bob, if we were ready to talk about that, we would have gone ahead and told you that that's what we were planning. But it's obvious that is as you put the customer in the middle, you put families in the middle, and you think about the opportunity you have, if you're the one selling them the items they buy all the time and serving up the items that they might love to discover, it just creates all kinds of opportunity. I think financial services as a suite is one example. Health care leads you in a lot of different places. The idea that we could help people with health care in a way that makes health care in the country more preventative, certainly high quality, affordable, accessible is something that I think not only opens us up to all of the industries that make up health care, but also helps with the overall relationship in the way that people think about Walmart, and that could lead us into a lot of different directions. The other one that comes to mind that was on our list but we didn't talk a lot about it is data monetization. Data is obviously really valuable and we've got a history of giving our data away to suppliers and doing that so that we could get in-stock and that's obviously really important and some portions of our data will continue to be free because we need their help serving our mutual customers. But there are other aspects of our data that are really valuable and can be put to work in ways that we haven't before. And the concept of building products, digital products that we can use internally and also monetize outside is a really exciting prospect. And some of those things will be purely digital, some will be a combination of people plus digital. Think of last mile, for example, this advantage that we have with supercenters so close to people can be monetized in ways that we haven't before, because the speed it provides and the relationship that it provides. So, I think in future years just as we did today, we will show you this evolving business model and show you new things. And in some cases we may tell you, this one didn't work, we are taking it off, we're adding this one on, and I think that's how it should be frankly. Go ahead Bob, we still see you. Robert Drbul : Yes, sorry. Yes, just were in the mute. Two questions for Brett, really. I think the first one is, can you talk about your price investment flexibility? There's been a lot of discussion from the CPG companies about taking price and their ability to take price. So how do you guys fit into that and how are you thinking about it? The second question I think also for Brett. With the cost of debt being where it is, can you talk a little bit about your willingness to perhaps maybe take on some debt for additional share buyback, or any thoughts around that would be helpful? Thanks. That will be it. Brett Biggs : Yes, on price I said our price gap's early as good as they've been, in some cases higher than they've been. We are going to continue to be the price leader in markets; it's really important to what we do. It's important to our customers and it's part of who we are as a company. But we're going to be thoughtful about it. We're going to be strategic about it. We want you to come in, and as a customer, as you get a basket from Walmart we want that to be the best deal you can get as a customer. That's who we are in EDLP. Doug McMillon : Yes, I will just add that John and Scott and the team are thinking about rollbacks. I mean, there are going to be times this year that it would be difficult for families and we've got this history of creating rollbacks and lowering prices, and some of those plans are in place with the guidance that we gave you earlier today. Brett Biggs : Yes, and your question on capital obviously is a good one. We just announced the $20 billion share buyback today that we think we will execute over the next three years or so. We are in an enviable cash position because of the cash we generated because of the execution now of the Asda transaction and cash coming in. It's okay to think to hold a little more cash right now. We are -- we always look at share buyback. The first thing we want to do, Bob, and you've seen this more is we want to invest in the business. That's the first thing we always want to do and I think we're doing that to the extent that we feel like we need to, to execute our strategy. Our dividend, we just increased it 48 years in a row. And then you get down kind of to share buyback, I feel good about our company. I feel great about the valuation of the company. And so you will continue to see us, as you can tell by what I said this morning, pretty aggressive from a share buyback standpoint. Dan Binder : Thanks, Bob. Next we will go to Steph Wissink at Jefferies and then Michael Lasser after that. Stephanie Wissink : Good morning everyone. We also have two questions if we could. Doug, the first is for you. I was really struck by the language you were using around shifting from an option for your consumers to being their preferred choice, or their preferred destination, primary destination. So can you talk a little bit more about how you energize your teams to really think about Walmart as the primary destination, and maybe give us a little hint on Walmart+, where you are in some of the learnings around that? And then, Brett, a question for you, and maybe this goes back to an earlier question on the incremental margins. But if I'm hearing you correctly, your past fiscal '22 expanding margin leverage from an expense perspective, expanding margins on the gross side from a mix and some of the alternative streams of value perspective, how should we translate that into the flow through to operating margin? Something better than that 30 basis points, 40 basis points a year? Thank you. Doug McMillon : Yes. I will go first on primary destination. The Supercenter does a great job of doing that. And I always think of what it was like when I was a teenager and my mom was headed out the door and she would say, I'm going to Walmart, what do you need? I didn't really think about it then, but looking back on it now, the fact that she didn't say I'm going shopping, or I'm going to a grocery store what you need, she said I'm going to Walmart. And she bought everything that we could possibly buy at Walmart, and so many Americans and people around the world do that today and that's obviously really important. But we didn't get that done in eCommerce in early stages. We weren't the first place you go when it's time to buy products online. We are trying to change that obviously. You've got to earn that; you've got to have the assortment, you got to have the price, you got to provide service, you got to deliver when you're supposed to deliver. All of those things have to be done. And it takes some time to build those kinds of capabilities. But as we are building that, the opportunity we have is in the way that we put them together. And if the combination of the Supercenter stores, neighborhood markets, in some cases Sam's Club and the Internet can cause Walmart in the omni-channel future to continue to be a primary destination, that's obviously the number one thing that we want to get done and that's a priority for us. Once you have that, and that doesn't mean it's just food and consumables, people are buying a lot of hard lines or buying general merchandise. Our general merchandise share went up this past year, driven largely by what was happening in stores. eCommerce obviously grew at a higher rate, but the store volume was amazing. If we can get that done, it opens up all these other opportunities with the flywheel as we were discussing earlier. Walmart+ is a component of that plan. But the number one aspect of the three dimensions we've got today for Walmart+ is the delivery of items from our supercenters. eCommerce deliveries are important, but the supercenter perishable assortment is obviously really important. And we've got a limit on how much we can pick and deliver from stores. The automation that we're investing in will help change that. And the other capacity choices that we're making will help unlock that, which will enable Walmart+ to grow more. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves and go sell too many Walmart+ memberships and have a customer experience that is less than our expectation, or their expectation. So Net Promoter Score is a key metric for example that we keep our eye on. So Walmart+ will grow, and there may be some things that we add to it over time that are more digital in nature that enable even more membership growth. But when I think about Walmart+, the thing that I'm focused on most is the Net Promoter Score of a Walmart+ member, not the number of memberships that we're selling. The number of memberships will work out, but let's focus on quality as we start to scale it. Walmart+ then unlocks data that we can use to serve up items for customers more effectively, which helps us with margin mix. So, that's important and something that over time will matter to the company. We are not great at that today. It's a skill we are learning. I mean, I think in the future it will be even more important to the company. Brett Biggs : Yes, the construct of the P&L, as you can imagine is pretty near and dear to my heart and it's been fun to go through the last several months with the executive team. And again, I said in my comments, even so it's been as long as I have, you have to step back and realize how many levers we have to pull as a company. And now, we're in higher growth markets in International and we're investing in eCommerce and exciting things in International. We're growing Sam's. There's all these levers that we can pull. And the good thing about that is that there may be a year we pull this lever, or maybe a year we pull a different lever or maybe a quarter we pull a lever, a quarter we pull another lever, but it all works. When you look longer term, where we are really trying to control our own destiny is really important as we've been focused on operating discipline on the expense side and we've made progress in that regard and I still think that's going to happen longer term; I feel very confident about that. These new revenue streams are growing revenue streams, and profit streams are a big part as well of giving us a different way to make money that just frees up even more levers and gives the company more optionality, which is so important. We talked about sales growth of being over 4% into the future. That helps a lot with every data point when you get sales growing like that, because even at the same operating -- operating margin percentage, you can just grow dollars and that's really what the productivity loop is all about. Doug McMillon : Yes, there was a time when I think a lot of people thought, given our scale that we could only grow 1% or 2%. And even before the pandemic, we had proven that was not the case. I mean if you do what customers want you to do, you can grow the top-line and then you can manage the bottom line. So we think what we've put in place the last few years, I'm really confident will help us for a generation. And that's what we are out to do. We are out to position the company for the next generation of retail. And we think because of omni-channel and because of our culture and because of our progress in technology and mindset shift that we've got the opportunity to do that. And we will manage the short-term, but we are building for the long-term. Brett Biggs : But that -- if these things come together, the way that we believe they will and way we've planned them, it does give opportunity for that operating margin to grow over time. Doug McMillon : And some of those things are scaling now. So as we talk about fulfillment services and advertising and some of these other things, 2 years ago we were just getting started, or 18 months ago. I think PhonePe is only 4 or 5 years old. I mean, some of the numbers Judith was covering is like, really, it reached that scale in like 4 years? Four years ago, we weren't even talking that much about a pickup business, which is huge today, right. So when I look at our situation, our flywheel, I don't feel like there is anything speculative in it. We've got traction on these things. It's just that they're smaller, but the ability to grow them seems apparent that we just execute and we can execute. Thanks, Steph. Dan Binder : Thanks, Steph. Let's go to Michael Lasser with UBS next and then Robbie Ohmes after that. You have to unmute, Michael. Doug McMillon : Michael, we can see you, but we can't hear you. The most uttered phrase these days, you're on mute. Michael Lasser : Sorry. Thank you. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Can you more deeply connect the investments that you're making this year and how they're going to allow Walmart to generate that 4% top line growth that you're expecting, especially because one could argue that these investments are necessary just to keep up with the changing environment? For instance, does this mean you expect to be able to maintain 20% to 30% eCommerce growth in U.S. business even as you generate stable to improving sales in the U.S., and why? And as part of this, do you expect that the wage investments to yield as much of a return this time around as they might have last time around, whereas last time you were a bit more proactive, and this time the environment is a little different. Then I have a follow-up on the guidance for this year. Doug McMillon : Yes. I think the wage investment will pay off and if you're one of those 400,000 people that we are talking about today, your attitude about Walmart the way you're feeling today is different, and we're asking them to do work in a different way. We are asking our associates to adapt, and I think the investments we are making in them correspond to that. So I do expect a nice return from those investments. It will help with retention. It will help with them able to do their jobs at a really high level of productivity. I am a little distracted by Michael's lack of inability to shave and I'm worried about our razor sales. I'm sorry, I could not get that thought out of the mind. Michael Lasser : Times are tough. Times are tough. Doug McMillon : We sell a lot of razors on the app, Michael. Like, you can get some. Michael Lasser : I will be there. Doug McMillon : I know there's a lot of \u2026 Brett Biggs : We haven't seen some of you in a while. Michael Lasser : Yes, that\u2019s -- I look forward to when we are together in person. Doug McMillon : It's a challenge to do all this virtually. As it relates to the 4% growth, we just have a lot of opportunity with eCommerce. We are not good at it yet. I mean, we are adding assortment, we are adding brands. Things are scaling, the marketplace is scaling nicely. We need more investment and capacity to have the fulfillment service achieve its potential and serve customers as well, as ultimately we must. So, yes, I think the investments that we are making are going to create upside, which should translate into not just keeping up with market growth, but exceeding market growth, building on the other relationships we have with customers including the one that's most important right now, which is the one in our stores. Brett Biggs : And one thing too, Michael, if you think about now the International markets that we are in, they are for the most part higher growth markets than the total that we've had over the last several years. So that that helps as well. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is, as you pointed out at the outset, there is a lot of uncertainty with trying to project sales this year. And this is happening at the same time that you are making these sizable investments. So, if your top line result is a little bit lower than you expect, do you see outsized deleverage in your P&L, or is there room to preserve your profitability such that we should think about while there's uncertainty with the top line, there is less uncertainty with the bottom line for this year? Doug McMillon : Yes, there's some room, and we will manage the year as we can go through it as best we can. We've got -- as Brett and I talk about all these levers all the time, and gross margin is one of them. But I wouldn't want to do anything, Michael that harms the business or slows down the strategy beyond this coming year. I think we are going to be fine this coming year and we\u2019ve done the best job we can of describing to you what we see. But we are -- the decisions we are talking about mostly today are not aimed at the next 12 months; they're aimed at the next few years. And we won't lose sight of that. We will stay on track as it relates to those kinds of things. Dan Binder : Thank you, Michael. Doug McMillon : Thanks, Michael. Dan Binder : We will go to Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America next and then Seth Sigman. Robert Ohmes : Sorry, guys. Can you hear me? Doug McMillon : Hey, Robbie, we are good. Robert Ohmes : Great. Great to see you. A couple of questions I guess for you, Doug. I was hoping the multibillion dollar ad business in the near future, I was hoping you could maybe talk about it a little more maybe than I was expecting. What -- where does the confidence come from? And I don't know if you can weave into it the TikTok situation. Is there anything you guys learned from that situation about where Walmart fits in within this social media platform world that you can share with us? And then my separate -- well, I will go -- I will ask my separate question for Brett after you answer that question. Doug McMillon : Yes. I think as it relates to advertising, Robbie, we've got a unique opportunity because of our stores. We've got all of the things available to us related to eCommerce growth and digital growth. And the reporting we provide for the investors in our advertising program is there. And we can show you that down the road if a customer decides to come into a physical store, our store and buy it, we can connect those dots for you. That's the unique proposition of our advertising program. And we just haven't been that aggressive with our site and app. We want to preserve the customer experience when they're looking for an item and not have ads clutter that up in a way that is going to detract from the experience. So, we are going to manage that as we drive the growth up. But as I mentioned before, there's just a ton of traction there. What\u2019s happening with social commerce is exciting. It's been nice to have assets around the world including in China to learn from how people are behaving as it relates to social commerce. And we think we've got an opportunity to partner in different ways with different people to connect the dots on commerce, because sometimes a marketplace approach to a front-end that's driven by advertising doesn't result in the best customer experience because of lack of fulfillment or other components that make up a great, seamless, fast, simple experience. The TikTok live stream that we tried I think attracted 700,000 people and that happened kind of quick, and I think we can do an even better job of bringing attention to events like that when we want to. And so the team is learning and it will -- I think in 6 months, 12 months, we will look back on social commerce and we will see more traction and we will see Walmart playing a role in that. In some cases that will be just a simple partnership and we will work out the terms of that partnership and that\u2019s what I think you can expect from us as it relates to that. There is a connection back to advertising, where I think our mindset needs to be, we are retailer first, commerce first, serve the customer first and all these other things that flow from that, including the monetization of data and advertising will be secondary and tertiary to the number one thing. Robert Ohmes : Yes. That's helpful. Thanks. And then Brett, I was hoping you could -- if you take the US eCommerce business and take away alternative profit streams and then just look at the profitability per transaction across the U.S eCommerce business, did that -- how did that look this last fiscal year versus previous years? And then maybe automation and a lot of these investments you're making, do they improve the profitability of the transactions or is that more about driving revenue growth in digital? Brett Biggs : Yes, it's -- Robbie, we've talked about several things over the past few years, several things we look at when we look at that eCommerce P&L, which is a very integrated part of the U.S P&L. When we look at contribution margin, and that's improved this year, it's improved the years before that and so that's a big reason of why we've seen losses reduced in the U.S eCommerce business. But also on the logistics side, the cost to ship, the variable cost to ship has continued to improve. And these investments are there -- I would answer yes to all of what you just asked, as they are there to drive revenue, they're there to drive efficiencies, they're there to drive better customer service or customer experience. It's all of that, and that's what's great about these investments is they're just -- there's all of the pieces that we need from the eCommerce business that fulfills that. Doug McMillon : The growth in marketplace was a big deal too. Brett Biggs : Yes. Doug McMillon : I mean, the first party contribution profit got better and then marketplace scaled, which helps blend the whole thing together. And Robbie, it's kind of reminiscent of how we\u2019ve managed mix back when I learned merchandising to begin with, we had items that we made higher margins on and items we made lower margins on. Today, we are just doing the same thing. It's mix management, but we not only manage category mix, but we manage channel mix with one 1P, 3P all the components that we are talking about which I think is helpful as it relates to our structure now. The omni-channel approach gives people an opportunity to manage things across, and that's how they should be managed. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Robbie. Dan Binder : Thanks Robbie. We've got time for just one more question. We will go to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Doug McMillon : Hi, Kelly. Kelly Bania : Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me, okay? Doug McMillon : We can. Kelly Bania : Perfect. Just wanted to ask another question on U.S eCommerce maybe following a little bit from Robbie's question. When we look at U.S EBIT dollar growth, it was about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion this year. Can you just help us understand a little bit the magnitude that eCommerce, the improvement in eCommerce losses contributed to that? Could it be a third, or more? And then I guess, Brett, you talked about reaching maybe $100 billion globally, I think that was in eCommerce over the next few years, so it sounds like maybe 15% to 25% growth. But can you talk a little bit longer-term about what mature margins could be there? And as you think about advertising, financial services marketplace, what is part of that as you think about U.S eCommerce margins, or maybe those are separate? Brett Biggs : Yes, there's a lot in that in those questions, Kelly. We -- as you look at the profitability increase in Walmart U.S., particularly this last year there was so many pieces of that. There is improvement, obviously, 8.6% comp sales helped a lot all the way down the P&L. Gross margin rates with improvement in mix, as Doug was talking about, general merchandise with a lot of increased costs, over $4 billion in costs globally as a company related to COVID. So it's a little tough to parse out all of that. And the eCommerce business is becoming even a more integrated part of what we are doing in the stores. But eCommerce losses did improve significantly during the year. As we think about going forward, what I had said in my remarks is that we expected $100 billion in global eCommerce over the next couple years and could see $200 billion a few years after that. All of these -- I mean, going to go back to the comment I made about levers, and we certainly think about and we know the pieces of the business and what the profitability of is each one, and that's important. But we are looking at that total and how do we grow the total. Hence, we wouldn't be going into these businesses, any of these businesses if we didn't think they were going to be profitable long-term. But each business serves a purpose and it serves potentially a different purpose at a different time. So all of this goes into how we think about our financial algorithm. But having that 4% top line growth, having operating income grow faster than sales, that's the algorithm. How we get there it can change over time, and I think that's great that it can change over time, that we have that flexibility to do that. Dan Binder : Thanks, Kelly. So that wraps up our first Q&A session. We are going to take a brief 10 minute break and then we will resume our program. Thank you. John Furner : Good morning. I've never been more proud to talk about what's happening in the U.S. And let me start by thanking the team, our store associates, our people in fulfillment and distribution centers, our drivers, our technologists and corporate associates. Our people stepped up these past months like never before and they helped their fellow Americans get food, medicine, essential supplies, gifts for holidays and birthdays and even items to start new hobbies, and now they've distributed COVID tests and they're doing vaccines. I was in stores throughout the year and it was just incredible to see how our people worked so hard through so many obstacles. The pandemic, civil unrest, natural disasters, accelerated customer volume, constant changes to laws and regulations, and staffing disruptions due to leave that were understandable, but it did affect operations. Yet amid all of these challenges, we still reset layouts, managed availability and we improved quality. This is a picture of what we refer to as Produce 2.0. Our team was able to implement this last year and they did a great job maintaining the department all year with quality and availability. And there were other parts of the store where we struggled with being in stock, but we saw improvements in the recent quarter and our results reflect that. The in-store experience, it's the foundation of our business. Now, I've seen a lot of progress recently specifically in the last quarter. Of course, we also saw major changes to customer behavior last year, including nearly 3x the digital growth we were expecting before COVID. And we believe that represents lasting permanent change. And that\u2019s why, we think this is the time to invest more aggressively in our supply chain, in automation, in technology, and in our people, specifically those in omni-roles as we share today. And we are showing you the flywheel, so you can see why we feel empowered to make these investments right now. Our overall business is becoming healthier and we have billions of dollars and opportunities that when scaled can drive the returns we need. Yes, our investments are about adapting to our customers who want to shop. But look at our flywheel and understand that it's more than that. We are investing to grow. Looking at the center of the flywheel, our top priority last year outside of COVID concerns was to become even more customer driven and we've done that. We combined our apps and many of our services together, we redesigned stores, we launched Walmart+, a valuable and unique proposition that's simplifying customers' lives. And for the past year, we've been working as a combined organization : one merchandise org, one supply chain org, and one finance org for all the items Walmart sells with corporate incentives that are aligned and reflect that. We are now one business, representing how the customer sees us. And we are now better able to identify and attack problems from the mindset of the customer, using whichever assets make the most sense. For example, the bag you see on that porch contains items someone ordered from our traditional Walmart.com site just a few hours before. We\u2019ve algorithms that tell us when a customer's Walmart.com order includes items that are sitting in their local store and when it makes sense, we just pick those items from the shelf and we use our last mile network to drive them right to their home. And most customers are very surprised the first time this happens as they're expecting everything to come in a box a couple days later. 3,000 of our stores are now doing these deliveries and they've added density to our last mile business and helped accelerate it. And think of the savings on something like a television that we are now able to deliver from a store a few miles away instead of from an FC several states away. And for years, we said that one of our biggest advantages was having 100,000 of the highest demand items within 10 miles of 90% of U.S households. And this is a way we are better leveraging that advantage to serve our customers. Now looking at primary destination, I will add last year, we saw the power of EDLP and great items like never before. We just delivered an 8.6 comp for the year. We had a historic fourth quarter that was just shy of $100 billion in sales. Now it's amazing to think about that because in 1993, the year I joined Walmart, we reported about $55 billion in sales for the year. Well, last year Walmart grew $40 billion; and in the U.S alone we grew $29 billion, more than half the volume we reported back in '93, my first year. And very different from my first year '93, last year, we picked almost 6 billion items for pickup and delivery. And we were recognized as the most downloaded U.S shopping app. The reason you see arrows on the flywheel is that it's mutually reinforcing. Primary destination is fundamental. Then we grow by deepening and expanding that relationship. We see two fundamental paths to expand general merchandise. One is delivering almost all the Supercenter straight to customer's homes. This is especially important as Walmart+ grows; the proposition will be and should be that you can have almost anything we sell in stores delivered within hours. The new delivery capability I mentioned is a big step towards getting there. Path two is using Walmart.com to expand way beyond the Supercenter in a way that's healthy for the long run. And we made a lot of progress, adding brands such as Lee, Reebok, DKNY and S'well. And this year, we will add many more, some iconic names that I'm very excited about. We have 13 general merchandise private brands that would be classified as $1 billion brands, and three of our apparel lines are $2 billion brands. We're seeing some strong initial progress from the combined merchant organization. Our customers and merchants are now able to benefit as our merchants think about all of our channels, stores, pickup, delivery, first-party and third-party. And that's led to new brands and better buying. Walmart.com contribution profit rates for categories have been up year-over-year each and every month since we combined, and we expect that that will continue. Our furniture and mattress business, for example, continues to be one of our top profit-driving categories across Walmart.com and it continues to grow. And we've seen a multiplying effect for things like accessories; customers who buy mattress on Walmart.com are more likely to buy a mattress cover or sheets in a store. We put new emphasis on building on a trusted, world-class marketplace business that dramatically expands our product and services. We've got a lot of momentum and we plan to accelerate it through strategic partnerships with Shopify, ChannelAdvisor and PayPal. And we are working with Judith's team on an international platform to reach customers and sellers outside the U.S. Health and wellness and financial services are on this part of the flywheel, because they're adjacent to our core business. And it's a natural fit with customers. We now have 20 Walmart health centers and with more in the pipeline. And looking at monetizing assets, the marketplace business I just mentioned is a huge opportunity because of what we can offer sellers. We have big goals with Walmart Fulfillment Services and with Walmart Connect, our advertising business, we have a multibillion dollar opportunity when you consider our reach. Our website and app, our TV walls and self-checkouts and our ability to help suppliers place ads outside the Walmart ecosystem. 5 years from now, we expect to be well within the top 10 advertising platforms in the U.S., ahead of big players like Hearst, Fox and Twitter. And Walmart is one of the biggest buyers of media in the country. We understand the relationship between advertising spend and business returns. So we know what marketers want. In terms of the flywheel, the Connect model will grow as other parts of the businesses grow, because we can do things like help marketplace sellers reach target audiences, creatively place targeted ads and buy buttons on digital platforms. And this is something that's happening a lot in other markets, but it's totally underdeveloped in the United States. And as Walmart+ drives loyalty and brings more data, we can help brands create new ads and experiences for our members. We are also very excited about our last mile delivery business. We are now doing about 1.5 million deliveries each and every week from stores, which is more than 7x what we were doing a year ago. We are doing this through a combination of our own Spark Driver platform and third parties. We are quickly getting items to customers and we expect to see delivery costs to continue to go down as we build volume and density. And I'm sure you've noticed that this flywheel is based on foundational components that have always been a part of our DNA in particular EDLC. We are working with a number of suppliers on next generation fulfillment technologies and we are scaling what's working. In our supply chain, we are using robotics to pick and palletize items by store, department and aisle, and this is helped both with productivity and in stock. In stores, we are very excited about our market fulfillment centers, which store and pick both refrigerated and non-refrigerated items. We've actually expanded our picking capacity stores in the past year, but we still have room to grow. But market fulfillment centers make the process significantly faster and more profitable. They move a significant amount of the picking off the sales floor, allowing us to do more within the box. And one of these fulfillment centers can serve a large area spanning multiple communities. And we're now moving to scale these locations and we expect to have over 100 of these within the next couple of years. And in some stores, we will carve out existing space for them. At others, we will add on. In some, we will build a standalone units. And there's a lot of good work with packaging. And we're also building a supply chain engine to anticipate demand specific to the locations and times. There are literally billions of dollars of opportunities on the table here. And I'm also proud that we have so many members of our technology, product and design teams focused on building tools for our store associates. Now, you may remember me talking about Ask Sam, an app that we developed when I was at Sam's Club. It lets associates speak questions into their handhelds and get immediate answers that in many cases save them a trip to the backroom or across the store. We've rolled out Ask Sam at Walmart and one metric that shows you just how much our associates like this app is that once someone starts using it, they ask an average of 10 questions a day. And the last part of the flywheel is reinvesting in the customer value proposition. And that\u2019s the whole point of this flywheel; how we create the growth and profit pools we need to be an even better retailer. We will keep innovating and we will keep investing where we need to including in our people. In the past year, for example, we doubled the number of our store associates supporting omni initiatives. We restructured to a team based model that's more aligned with an omni focus and we've continued to invest in wages. Today I was proud to inform more than 400,000 people that they're getting a raise, and I know this will lead to an even better customer experience. I'm really excited about our strategy in the future. It's a tremendous opportunity to have the largest retail business in the U.S., growing sales with profitable billion-dollar businesses inside it and to be moving as quickly as we are right now. In just the past 6 weeks, for example, you saw us create a FinTech startup, announce the expansion of fulfillment technologies in stores, rename and expand our advertising business, launch delivery from our 3,000 store and begin scaling vaccinations to do more than 10 million doses per month. We are moving fast, but we have to move fast and we're making the investments we need to move fast. But we hope you see today that we're doing it in a strategic and healthy way. And in a world full of friction we are making life easier for people in a way that's authentic to Walmart. Thank you. Judith McKenna : Thank you, John. It's great to see how the flywheel is working and generating continued momentum in our U.S business. Today I want to talk about two things : the universal applicability of the flywheel to our international businesses with a particular focus on Mexico and India and also talk about the changing shape of our international portfolio. But you can't talk about our business without first saying a massive thank you to our 700,000 extraordinary associates in Walmart International. They have stood tall during the last year and served our customers when they needed it most. They are true heroes. And in all of the numbers and strategies you will hear from us, they are the real story in every corner of the Walmart world and they make our business possible. This has been a strong year for the International business. We've delivered strong results. We've reshaped our portfolio, making deliberate choices about ownership for Asda Japan and Argentina. We\u2019ve created new and exciting partnerships, which help build out our ecosystems and we have significantly accelerated growth in eCommerce. In fact, eCommerce penetration of international sales grew by almost 40% last year. Turning first to the portfolio, we\u2019ve closed on the deals with Argentina and Asda. And we expect to close the Japan deal in the very near future. That's three major transactions all done virtually with virtual transition plans in place. And I want to specifically recognize the teams in each of those markets for their work this year. A pandemic and a sale process is not easy to manage. We know that we are bringing to life our strategy of strong local businesses powered by Walmart. And one of the key points that makes our operating model unique is that we are flexible. We will find the right ownership structure to be successful in each market, be it wholly-owned, majority-owned, or minority stake. We are also building strategic partnerships through equity investments to support our core businesses. First, in JD and Dada in China and now Aditya Birla Fashion Retail and Ninjacart in India; all great examples. All these structures contribute to powered by Walmart as we learn from those that we have a relationship with, be it through boards, or direct commercial relationships. And that learning is already benefiting the whole of Walmart in shaping our perspectives. The portfolio moves we've made allow us to focus our resources to invest in our growth markets and drive their flywheels. Mexico, Canada, China, and India will all see investments this year. It's all part of building strong local businesses powered by Walmart. Our markets may have different structures, but what's common are the fundamentals of the flywheel to drive sustainable growth. At the core, they're all customer-centric and have mutually reinforcing assets that generate innovation, engagement, growth and profitability. The secret is that each one is tailored to the market which it serves. What is most relevant to the local customer and where is the country on its development curve. Each market is testing, developing and scaling products and services that builds out a flywheel relevant to them, whether they create them themselves or they adapt from other markets. Over the past year, we've seen exponential growth in eCommerce. We've grown eCommerce sales in China by 89%. We've added pickup and delivery capabilities to hundreds of stores across Canada. We are seeing eCommerce growth in Mexico of 171%. We're processing over $1 billion monthly payment transactions in India with PhonePe. And our recent launch of Flipkart Wholesale, we've brought together Flipkart's core strengths in technology and logistics with Walmart India's Cash & Carry business to help step change B2B retail in India, creating opportunity to support millions of kiranas across the country. Our success in eCommerce last year has been in part because of our unique global footprint and the access to markets with some of the most innovative eCommerce and omni-channel ecosystems in the world. In 2020, best practice sharing truly lived up to its promise, bringing powered by Walmart to life. And we were able to leverage skills, technology, and products, and iterate in real-time to serve our customers. Around the world, we are making progress to every stage of the flywheel, and especially, in Mexico, where it's been a year of true acceleration. I talked last year about the strength of Walmex and thank you to those of you who followed up after that. It's been another strong year for them. Remember, this is a public company listed on the Bolsa. And earlier today, we presented Walmex results and strategy plans to the market. Walmex is a scale business, serving more than 5 million customers daily from nearly 3,500 stores and clubs across Mexico and Central America. Gui and his team have done an outstanding job in an incredibly challenging year with the pandemic and other natural disasters significantly impacting Mexico and Central America. And they have still delivered high growth, strong margins and a very strong ROI. Walmex has always been good at boldly innovating within the market. First with Bodega, then bringing Sam's Club to Mexico and now with eCommerce. They are putting in place the elements of the flywheel and seeing results. But I'll ask Gui to tell you in his own words about the business. Guilherme Loureiro : Thank you, Judith, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our results for calendar 2020, which we just shared with investors in Mexico this morning. This has been a challenging year for our business and I\u2019m very proud of the way our associates rose to the occasion. They delivered great results. We saw total revenue increase 8% year-on-year in Mexico. We were able to grow 130 basis points ahead of competitors. eCommerce sales grew 171% and we reinforced our leadership in online grocery. Disciplined cost control allowed us to grow more than $1 billion eCommerce business, while we improved an EPS and profitability. We also innovated to expand omni-channel and last mile capabilities across our fleet. Before I go on, I want to remind you of who we are today. Walmex is the largest private employer in Mexico with nearly 200,000 associates across the country. We have stores within 10 minutes of 85% of Mexico's population in the top metro areas, and we are a major contributor to the Mexican economy. We have unique strengths that position us to become Mexico's leading omni-channel retailer. By now, you are familiar with the flywheel. And I'm going to spend a few minutes showing you how our flywheel works in Mexico. At the very top, we are focused on winning the primary destination. The shape of retail is changing faster than ever and we are growing differently than before. Our new Bodega Stores continue to be a driver for us. Our growth engine has been strong, efficient comp growth. Last year that was 6.7% with nearly 3% of that coming from our growing omni-channel capabilities. We continue to innovate and move with speed to serve our customers better. We reinforced our omni business by enabling 586 on-demand stores at 1,348 pickup locations and 1,128 kiosks and rebuild 63 stores, opened three new distribution centers, and rolled out our Spark last mile delivery program to almost 30 stores. We also invested to add capacity to our supply chain and drive automation. Going forward, we will double- down on each of these fronts. As we move through the flywheel, our next step is to further extend GM assortment. This year, we will significantly increase the number of sellers in our marketplace. First, focusing on local, then develop through cross-border trade. At the same time, we are creating mobile financial solutions that will further link customers into our ecosystems for payments, credit and remittances. This year, we'll give customers the ability to load their digital wallet with credit and debit cards and choose it as a payment method in our online business. This is a natural build on our omni business that helps us solve another customer pain point, speed of payment and money transfers. Moving around, we see cost control and new revenue streams adding further momentum to their flywheel. EDLC and productivity have been core to our business from the beginning. This year we launched this Smart Spend, which allow us to leverage learnings across U.S and international markets. And we are excited about the potential for a high margin advertising business, Walmart Connect, which we expect to grow by 60% in the coming year. All this comes together as we reinvest into our core customer and associate value propositions. Customer expectations took a giant leap forward in 2020. Thanks to the resilience of our team and the flywheel model, we had the resources and agility to accelerate our strategy and leap with them. Back to you, Judith. Judith McKenna : Gui, thank you. We are proud of what you and the team are doing, and I'm excited to see your flywheel gain even more momentum as we go through 2021. Now I said I would come back to India. And while the flywheel specifics to Flipkart and PhonePe are different to the ones that you've heard about earlier, the concept is just as relevant there as anywhere with a customer-centric ecosystem central to success. It's 2.5 years since we invested in Flipkart, and the fundamentals of why we invested remain unchanged. And we continue to be impressed and we are learning a lot. I am more confident than ever in the work that they're doing to serve our customers in India. And they're building a strong business and helping support economic growth right across the country. Flipkart and PhonePe have risen to the challenges of the health crisis. And with digital adoption in all its forms accelerating in India, both have emerged stronger as we entered into 2021 than when I last spoke to you in 2020. Flipkart saw more than 250 million customers over a 5-day period during its recent Big Billions Day event. And PhonePe has just reached that milestone of $1 billion monthly payment transactions. Both businesses have consistently delivered against our expectations. Flipkart and PhonePe are part of each others ecosystems, but they are separate businesses. And we recently completed a partial spin-off of PhonePe that we will see each business get its own board of directors and give each more independence. So let me first look at Flipkart. Flipkart's GMV growth was impacted by a 53-day shutdown in the first half of the year. But the business rebounded and exited Q4 with strong momentum, delivering GMV growth roughly double that of the full year. This is a credit to the resilience and the agility of our CEO, Kalyan and his team who were able to pivot and continue to drive growth recognizing the role that they had to play in serving customers. And at the same time, they strengthened the core business to be more resilient. That agility is not surprising to us because Flipkart is a tech company with customers at its heart. This is a rapidly expanding eCommerce platform with a growing suite of bundled services, a market leading position in categories like fashion, electronics and appliances and a promising ad-tech and wholesale businesses. We believe that Flipkart is positioned to win India's eCommerce future. And I caught up with Kalyan earlier this morning to share more about the opportunity in India and how the team is innovating and building capabilities to deliver that priorities this year. So Kalyan, India remains one of the most promising growth markets in the world for retail, but I would love to hear from you in your own words what makes the market so special? Kalyan Krishnamurthy : Judith, India has roughly 1.4 billion people today. 34% of the population are millennials, young people. By 2030, there is an estimate that this young population of millennials and GenZ will be 75% of the total population. 700 million Indians are digital today. And I also want to just quickly acknowledge that Digital India vision of the Government of India, which has actually enabled this. So you have a unique combination of a big market, completely digital, getting wealthier and very young. Let me just quickly talk about the eCommerce opportunity also in India, which is a result of the Digital India vision. A few years back, there was an estimate that by 2025 the eCommerce market size in India will be $50 billion to $60 billion. I just read a report from consulting firm Bain & Company that by 2025, the latest estimate is actually $90 billion to $100 billion. That is the real opportunity we are looking at in India today. Judith McKenna : It's remarkable, isn't it? The step change that\u2019s happening and has happened, and we could see that when we invested 3 years ago. But what I've loved seeing is how Flipkart has grown and lends into that shifting behaviors really. What is it that makes Flipkart so uniquely suited for this moment? Kalyan Krishnamurthy : Judith, let me just first give a headline on Flipkart. We are a company built by Indians for Indian consumers. Roughly 300 million customers shopping 150 million product listings across 80 categories. We are the leading product marketplace in India today. Flipkart is known for local innovation. If you just look at the last 7 to 8 years in commerce in India, in general, I would say, a huge number of innovations across commerce in the last several years have come from Flipkart. And Judith, this is not just in one area. When you open the Flipkart app to shop, everything you'll there -- see there. Just the access, searching for products, digital payments and the way you receive products, everything is innovated for the local Indian consumer. That's what Flipkart is all about. Very quickly, just talking about some innovations, which we are very proud of, which just happened in the last couple of years. Flipkart today offers five native languages in which you can actually get access to the product catalog of Flipkart. We recently also launched voice-enabled shopping, which is very unique in India today. So these are some of the big innovations which we've done in the last few years, Judith. Judith McKenna : Yes, I just love the innovative nature of this and the fact that you're absolutely designing what\u2019s right for the Indian customer. But it's more than just a platform though, and there is so much more to what you're doing as well, isn't there? Kalyan Krishnamurthy : Absolutely, Judith. I think what people see in the world when they open the Flipkart app, it's just an app with a lot of products there. But behind the scenes, there is a few things which is really enabling all of this. First is, talent. We are so proud of having the best of best talent in India. Actually our engineering talent, technology talent is actually a global talent sitting in India. Outside of that, if you just look at the top investment areas for Flipkart in the last few years which will actually continue into the next few years will be in technology and infrastructure, supply chain through Ekart, which is among the largest consumer supply chains in India today. Judith McKenna : That\u2019s incredible, isn't it? And the way that you've used Flipkart -- Ekart and integrated it has been amazing. And it just reminds me when you talk about innovation and some of those areas, just how quickly you and the team turned things around. You were shut for 53 days during last year due to the pandemic, and I remember them well. Many of the challenges that you faced in 2020 really you reacted so well to them and you actually finished the year even stronger than you started despite everything. What was it that really made a difference for you and the Flipkart team? Kalyan Krishnamurthy : Sure, Judith. It's a great question. While 2020 saw great customer adoption, we saw an acceleration in the business, but it was actually not about the business in 2020. It was all about safety and partnerships. And once again, we were really inspired by the Government of India. They are the ones who initiated this trade-off in favor of safety. We worked with our employees, our ecosystem partners and invested heavily in safety. And this is not just financial investments, infrastructure investments, education to all our ecosystem partners and employees on safety. Second is, we over indexed on partnerships. We were very clear quite beginning -- in the beginning of the year itself that in a pandemic like this, actually it will be easier for bigger companies to pull this through, but smaller partners, ecosystem partners of Flipkart will actually find it quite difficult to get on the other side of this. So we invested in partnerships in a big way. We once again invested not just financially, we actually listened to them, spoke to them and understood what they really wanted. So it was a big year for partnerships. To your specific question, we absolutely saw an acceleration in customer adoption. Customer is at the core of Flipkart, and that's the way it has been for the last several years. In the beginning of the year, we saw several new insights come up for Flipkart customer insights and we saw some new trends emerging which was not there before. The meaning of the essential categories people were shopping for was evolving very rapidly. So once again, we worked with our seller partners to make sure that we\u2019ve the right selection for the consumers which is evolving in 2020. So that was another big priority. Finally, we also used this opportunity to actually completely rearchitect our financials. I would summarize 2020 as a year when we got closer to our seller partners, closer to our consumers, a more clustered employee brand, and finally, more financially prudent. Judith McKenna : Yes, that's great. And I couldn't put it better myself. And I think what was really fascinating to watch is the way that you reacted in the moment to what you needed to do, but you're really keeping a long-term view of how the company could evolve and grow in different ways. So let's look forward now to 2021 that we are already in. What priorities are you thinking about as you continue to build out your ecosystem and really think about driving growth for Flipkart? Kalyan Krishnamurthy : Sure, Judith. Actually, once again, just mentioning the point I mentioned before. We are very, very good at listening to our customers. That's the core of Flipkart. And one big insight which we\u2019ve seen in the last few years is that India as an eCommerce market is evolving from trial list consumers to loyal consumers. So one of the biggest challenges we've taken on ourselves is how to have a very strong value proposition for our loyalty program. So Flipkart+, which is a very uniquely local loyalty program is one very big priority. Second is grocery as a category is something where we want to strengthen our value proposition, especially partnering with the roughly million kirana partners we already have in our ecosystem. Fashion is a very big category in India, underpenetrated digitally. So we want to actually capitalize on that opportunity. And finally, as I mentioned before, technology and infrastructure will be two very big investment areas next year and going forward. We are also experimenting with more and more revenue models. For example, continuous investments in our advertising platform, which is among the top five advertising platforms in India today. Overall, Judith, I would summarize Flipkart and India as a big, big opportunity ahead of us. Of course, there are challenges, but we are up for the challenges. Judith McKenna : It sounds fantastic. Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm really excited about what the future Flipkart looks like. And huge thank you to you and the team for everything that you've been doing through 2020 and are going to do in the years to come. Kalyan Krishnamurthy : Thank you, Judith, for the partnership. Judith McKenna : Thank you, Kalyan. We are really looking forward to seeing your progress as you bring the next 200 million Indians online. Now let's move on to PhonePe. The Indian government's vision for digitization really comes to life when you think about payments. UPI was launched in 2016 and has enabled extraordinarily rapid growth. In fact, I recently read that the UPI value of transactions is now equivalent to 15% of India's GDP. That growth is remarkable. And as the market leader UPI transactions, PhonePe is enabling access and inclusion for hundreds of millions of Indians right from their phones. Last year, we spoke about PhonePe's ambition to build capabilities that allow Indians to spend, manage and grow their money. So I'm excited to introduce Sameer, Co-Founder and CEO of PhonePe. So update on where the business is along that journey? And also talk about that focus on being an open platform innovating for our B2C and B2B customers and on developing new revenue streams? Sameer Nigam : Thank you, Judith. It's been another year of significant progress for PhonePe. But what stood out for me the most during 2020 was the sheer resilience of Indians during these testing times. Here is a short video showing just that. [Video Presentation] Last March, while India was under a strict national lockdown due to COVID, in true PhonePe spirit, hundreds of our employees worked together and launched the I for India donation campaign to help raise money for the PM CARES Fund. Our month long national campaign helped raise more than $6 million from 1.6 million donors. Post-lockdown, our offline sales force resumed the hard work to digitize kiranas and small businesses across India. PhonePe has already added 16 million merchants to our digital payments network. This year, we have set a target of creating over 10,000 rural jobs to scale our merchant network to 25 million small businesses across all 5,005 semi-urban and rural districts in India. Last year, we also started focusing heavily on building customized business growth solutions for India small businesses and kiranas. We launched a store discovery platform on our consumer app. It helps consumers discover and chat with all the local grocery shops, pharmacies and other essential service providers. We also launched PhonePe ATM, a service that allows small retail shops to double up as ATM centers where consumers can make quick petty cash withdrawals instead of having to visit banking ATMs that are miles away from their homes. More than 2 million merchants signed up as PhonePe ATMs in 2020. All these product innovations in 2020 have helped make our PhonePe business mobile app top 10 business category app in India that has been downloaded more than 10 million times already. On the consumer side too, COVID related lockdowns and social distancing needs have really accelerated the consumer shift in favor of digital payments, which is here to stay. India is witnessing unprecedented growth in digital payments adoption, and our own transaction volumes reflect this growth. PhonePe now has more than 275 million lifetime registered users, which essentially means that one in every five Indians now has PhonePe. Our monthly transaction count is up nearly 100% year-over-year. Our MAU has crossed 110 million monthly users with a very healthy 97% monthly customer rupee trade. Even in terms of monetary value, our annualized TPV run rate has crossed the $300 billion mark. At PhonePe, we continue to be a very small lean organization that harnesses the power of technology to transform lives positively. We obsess about building simple scalable and innovative product for every Indian. We are now applying the same philosophy to build what we hope will become India's most comprehensive financial services platform. I'm happy to report that our mutual funds category now has users spanning over 90% of the PIN codes in the country. We are also India's fastest growing InsurTech platform, having sold nearly 1 million insurance policies since March 2020. We started this company in 2016 with a vision of building India's best digital payments company. Today I'm very proud to report that PhonePe is leading in India across most key industry metrics, active users, active merchants, total transactions and TPV. Back to you, Judith. Judith McKenna : Thank you, Sameer. The team are doing some truly amazing work. So finally, let me reemphasize our key takeaways for International. Firstly, the shape of our portfolio is changing and we are focusing our resources on markets where we see the greatest opportunity for long-term, sustainable and profitable growth; strong local businesses powered by Walmart. Secondly, Walmart International has a unique global footprint and is able to move with speed, thanks to our access to innovation around the world. And finally, the flywheel applies no matter the shape or nature of our businesses. Building an ecosystem of mutually reinforcing assets with the customer at the center is our path to win the future of retail across International. Now I\u2019m delighted to have the opportunity to introduce Kath McLay, CEO of Sam's Club U.S. to talk about the Sam's Club format, which has also been a real powerhouse for us in International. I want to personally thank her and her team for the knowledge and learnings they continue to share about Sam's Club across our business. Over to you, Kath. Kathryn McLay : Thanks, Judith. And you're going to hear me talk today about how we are leveraging those learnings across the enterprise. This year, the warehouse channel has thrived in the U.S. and abroad. Consumers tend to warehouse clubs that could provide larger pack sizes and fewer trips. And at Sam's Club, we were ready with a strong omni foundation to serve members how and when they needed us. Our associates turned up to take care of our members and serve them in an omni way during this most unusual period. These patterns were consistent across the globe, driving growth in Sam's Club in the U.S., China and Mexico. In FY '21, our club format recorded $75 billion in sales. We have great momentum. And now, we are accelerating. Today, I'm going to talk to you about our business in the U.S., but I'm also going to talk to you about Sam's Club in Mexico and China led by my colleague Judith and the country Presidents in each market. While they are separate businesses, we are working together in ways that make our strong businesses even stronger. In the U.S. and abroad, Sam's Club is growing. That growth is driven by our focus on items and omni convenience. The power of the warehouse model and strengths of Sam's Club were even more evident during COVID. The effort we put into investing in tech and improving our item quality really paid off this year. Let's turn to the U.S. Comp sales excluding fuel and tobacco were up 15.8% in FY '21 and transactions increased by 8.9%. Families also responded to our contactless omni offerings like direct-to-home shipping, curbside pickup and Scan & Go. Equipped with these digital tools, Sam's Club saw tremendous membership growth and hit out the NPS of an all-time high. This all added up to a banner year for membership in the U.S. We added 6x the number of members than we did in previous years. We also saw a full 100 basis point improvement in our renewal rates. You can see how that adds up to a 9.4% increase in membership income, our greatest annual increase in six years. We are confident that we have the right offer to keep these members and attract even more, while working the model to grow profits. To explain why, let's walk through the warehouse model. Great items at disruptive prices are fundamental to the model. Sam's Club is an item business with a curated SKU range, so every item matters. Our merchants are experts at finding great items that members rely on and the unexpected products that members are excited to discover. Last year, we added more than 200 national brands like Beyond Meat, Casper and Kola. This coming year, we're making significant investments in digital tools that will arm our merchants with the best data so they can predict trends and select merchandise that seems handpicked for our members. Our Members Mark private brand continues to be vitally important in all our Sam's Club businesses. We know from our data that members who purchased Member's Mark are more likely to renew. So we want to continue to be hyper-focused on quality and innovate to build a bank of items that delight. I want to tell you about a few of my favorite Member's Mark items. Let's start with our shuffleboard and dining set. This is definitely the item no one knew they needed, but everyone wants as soon as they see it. Our senior merchant noticed members were responding to multi-function items. And during COVID, members were looking for at home entertainment. So she worked with the supplier to create an on-trend dining table that is not only a 12-foot shuffleboard, but a bowling game as well. And with six tools, marine quality decking and an included cover for just $1,899, it is already a hit with members. There is nothing else on the market like it, but just the shuffleboard and chairs alone would cost $3,000 at another retailer. Another one of my favorite discoveries are our danishes, and they highlight our merchant's commitment to quality. I've done a blind taste test with one of our competitors, and our version wins every time. This pastry went through a complete overhaul inspired by member feedback and a competitive review of similar items across the country. Our new recipe is exclusive to Sam's Club. We created with carefully sourced ingredients on European equipment to ensure the traditional processes are replicated. It is made with 100% butter and the dough is twisted by hand. Since we launched this recipe as a three pack for $2.98 last summer, sales are up 270%. And with the new supplier production facility coming online, we expect to double our sales this year. Great items drive the model. But it really starts to work when our merchants and operators buy for less and operate for less so we can offer disruptive prices. I am really proud of how our merchants and operators are working together to drive efficiencies across the club. We are simplifying our buys to make it easier on our associates and drive productivity. For example, we streamlined our freezer/cooler category by removing SKUs and increasing the number of full dual presentations for on-trend items, like our frozen acai bowls to reduce labor. You've heard us talk about our apps like Sam's Garage and Ask Sam, which as John mentioned, is now at Walmart. We have a lot more where that came from. We have apps for inventory management, for planning, for emergency operations, for pickup and more. These tools drive incredible productivity and allowed us to handle unprecedented sales volume growth this year, while maintaining a high NPS score. This is no easy feat. One example, is the Fresh app. Earlier this year, we rolled out a major enhancement using machine learning to improve production planning of our fresh offerings, like the danishes as I talked about earlier and other items we prepare in the club. We streamlined the process from eight steps to three and significantly improved accuracy. We're more efficient, we sell more and we produce less waste. And what used to take 8 minutes, now takes 30 seconds. All of that adds up to save labor costs so we can invest back in price. Now let's talk about convenience. Earlier, I talked about our omni offerings, Scan & Go as well as curbside pickup and direct-to-home. All three of these offers saw significant adoption increases in FY '21. Let's talk about my favorite, Scan & Go. Looking for a safe way to shop, members flocked to this tool in FY '21. Penetration for Scan & Go increased by 560 basis point. We built on this strength with the launch of Scan & Go Fuel in the fall. This launch significantly boosted adoption. Many members tried Scan & Go Fuel sparking use of the tool in the club as well. As you know, these products are transferable to the rest of the formats, and Walmart is now using Scan & Go too, launching it as part of their new Walmart+ membership. We will continue to innovate on Scan & Go, and you will see us testing some exciting new features this year to make this clever tool even better for our members. I'm also proud of our curbside pickup offer. At the onset of the pandemic, we listened to our members and launched a concierge service in just six days. That allowed our members to shop our assortment without having to leave their vehicles. Not only do this provide a critical service for our members when they needed it most, it helped inform and accelerate our curbside strategy. We quickly launched curbside pickup across the fleet in June. We have seen curbside orders increased triple digits for the year. We've expanded our GM assortment and we have more than doubled the capacity to meet strong member demand. Members love this service. It has an NPS of 80, a significant increase since June. We are not just focused on digital convenience though, we are committed to making the omni experience come to life in the physical environment as well. Last year, we piloted a new look and feel in a few of our clubs. The new branding is modern and minimalist, while highlighting the best things about Sam's Club, our incredible items and our omni offering. We've already made these updates in 56 clubs and plan to hit half the fleet this year and the remainder next year. We will continue to accelerate here to maintain our leading position and make shopping Sam's Club the most convenient experience in the channel. I want to talk briefly about ways we leverage Walmart scale at Sam's Club, and in turn, how we export Sam's Club assets throughout the enterprise. As part of Walmart, Sam's Club can leverage best-in-class services and resources like supply chain tech and procurement. This helps us keep our SG&A low so we can invest in digital tools and convenience that sets Sam's Club apart from the competition. Abroad, we've taken a great brand and made it successful in China and Mexico. And what we've learned in these markets helped us make the whole enterprise stronger. Our Mexico and China businesses have adopted tools that worked well for Sam's Club in the U.S. Mexico launched Express Membership, which allows members to sign up in 1 minute something that used to take 15 and is currently testing Ask Sam and our Fresh app. And we have expedited the member sign up and renewal process in Sam's Club China through our WeChat Mini program. We also worked together to share items that will be relevant across markets under the Member's Mark label and leveraged supplier agreements to lower costs for both private and national brands. In 2020, our global leverage program helped launch 700 new items in Sam's Club in Mexico and China. We have some really high performing clubs in Mexico and China. And we expect to open as many as 30 new clubs between the two markets over the next 3 years. In closing, you can see we are excited about the Sam's Club business and we are building on fabulous momentum. Abroad, we will continue to innovate while building clubs. And in the U.S., we will remain an item business with a focus on quality, price and assortment that continues to build on our strengths. An incredible team of associates, a winning model, a culture of innovation and digital assets that set us apart, all of this comes together to increase member advocacy that will continue to fuel growth. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Doug. Doug McMillon : Thanks, Kath. Now let's talk technology. I'm joined by Suresh Kumar, our Chief Technology and Development Officer. I know many of you had a chance to meet him at last year's meeting. He has been busy. He and his team are leading the effort to modernize our tech stack, put our data to work and build new capabilities and income streams. Suresh, last year we shared our plan to modernize our tech stack. Please tell everyone about our progress. Suresh Kumar : Thank you, Doug. Absolutely. So last year we talked our approach to moving faster and taking advantage of the developments in machine learning, artificial intelligence and other new technologies. Now these modern technology elements will enable Walmart to move with speed, be innovative and become more productive. Now we are modernizing our tech stack on an innovative hybrid cloud platform that is uniquely suited for Walmart, and I'm really pleased with the level of progress that we have made in this area on several different fronts. Now first, we added a lot of great talent to our tech team. We've brought in senior leaders from across the industry. And this has really created a deep domain expertise as we start building out more modern applications. Second, we\u2019ve been aggressively upgrading our infrastructure. We upgraded more than 50,000 servers, and that's allowing us to take advantage of the latest hardware and software. Now we also upgraded more than 2,000 stores to 1 gigabit per second fiber connection. And what this is allowing us to do, we can run machine learning and data workloads like computer vision and augmented reality, which demand a lot of bandwidth right inside our stores. Now but more than anything else, we have doubled down on our move to the cloud. We ran 100% of our U.S. eCommerce and Sam's customer journeys on the cloud this past holiday. And we also ended up building a data lake in the cloud and migrated more than 1.7 petabytes of data into it, and this is allowing us to run very advanced analytics in a very efficient manner. And lastly, we rolled out our cloud power checkout system to nearly 23,000 point-of-sale devices. And by the way, this is the same technology that powers the contactless customer experiences that Kath talked about in Sam's. So this migration to the cloud really has been at the center of our modernization efforts this past year. Doug McMillon : That's really good stuff. To me the highlights are the team we've assembled and the fact we stayed on schedule with all of those things during a pandemic and you worked remotely to get it all done. It's just amazing. A lot of the work that you just described though was necessary for kind of the mid and long-term, but we are actually already seeing some benefits from the modernization now. Would you share some of those? Suresh Kumar : We absolutely are. The most visible benefit was how we handled the volume surge when the pandemic started. Now our every day volume level started to rise and it rose to levels even higher than our prior holiday peaks and well above anything that we had seen when we started running holiday shopping events. Now migrating to the cloud allowed us to keep the site available for our customers, while operating lot more efficiently because we could scale up and we could scale down in a very seamless manner. Now, second, supply chain scaled very well during the holiday. We lit up over 2,500 stores to start delivering online orders, in effect, turning our stores into fulfillment mode. Doug McMillon : Very cool. Suresh Kumar : And we could do this, by the way, because we built a system that crunches millions of pieces of information to find the fastest and lowest cost node to deliver a particular order to a very specific customer. And of course, this is a huge win for our customers and for our business because not only did we deliver to customers a whole lot faster, but also at a lower cost. Doug McMillon : Our store associates enjoyed doing it too. Suresh Kumar : Absolutely. And another big benefit of modernization and using new technologies is actually for our store associates. Now John mentioned Ask Sam, and this is an app that uses natural language processing. We've also started testing out a new app that we called [indiscernible], and this one uses augmented reality. What this does is it directs our associates in the backroom to very quickly identify what needs to be taken upfront. And using this app, associates are able to take only one-third of the time to complete a task which they previously had to do by scanning each and every case. Doug McMillon : That's huge. Suresh Kumar : And by the way, these are just a few of the examples that illustrates the benefit of the work that we are doing. We are enabling the business to move with speed, become more productive and we are innovating on customer and associate experience. Doug McMillon : You and the team did some incredible things in 2020. For example, supporting the surge in eCommerce was amazing, but what are you most proud of? Suresh Kumar : So, Doug, when the pandemic hit, we found ourselves needing to deliver a new set of urgent priorities to help our associates and to help our customers. So, for example, we had to scale our VPN capabilities by 600%, our videoconferencing capabilities by over 100%. What this allowed us to do is to enable our corporate associates to work remotely without skipping a beat. Now, similarly for our customers, we delivered on features that allowed them to shop safely and conveniently, everything from contactless shopping options, COVID testing, site support, to delivery prescriptions. We launched over 100 features, big and small, to enable shopping during COVID. What I'm really proud of is how our team continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives, our tech modernization efforts, while at the same time innovating actually with speed to deliver on COVID-related business features that were needed to serve our customers and our frontline associates. Doug McMillon : Yes, your team stood tall in 2020. Looking forward, we are changing our business quickly and we are building new capabilities with tech playing a key role. What are some of the things that excite you the most? Suresh Kumar : So I continue to be excited about the work that we are doing with machine learning. It's helping us both improve efficiency in the business, and it is transforming our customer and our associate experience. So, one good example is how we manage our assortment. We built a machine learning model to optimize the timing and the pricing of markdowns. And this one effort alone saved us $30 million in markdown costs. Doug McMillon : Awesome. Suresh Kumar : Now, of course, we are going a whole lot further. We are building algorithms to better forecast demand and to optimize both the location and quantity of inventory, so that we reduce the need even to have markdowns in the first place. Another key area where we applied ML is in facilities maintenance. We now have an automated system to review thousands of proposals and invoices every day, and it does it for accuracy across multiple dimensions, like historical labor hours, costs of parts, travel time. And then the system recommends the ones to either approve or to reject. And our associates in real estate use the recommendations to increase proposal and invoice accuracy, and this has resulted in savings of at least $40 million last year. One more example is on the pharmacy side where we have been building out our data lake so that we can run ML models on top of it. We took out millions of dollars of costs by improving our supplier agreements and by improving our merchandising choices. We analyzed agreements to see where we could buy a whole lot more effectively. But at the same time, we recommended what drugs could be added to our $4 generics program. And of course, this helps strengthen our customer offering, while at the same time improving our cost position. So I've highlighted a few areas, but the power and the potential of ML is applicable in every single thing that we do and that is something that I'm really excited about. Doug McMillon : Me too. And really appreciate those savings, by the way. Now, let's talk about priorities. What will you be focused on looking ahead? Suresh Kumar : Yes, so Doug, last year was building about foundational capabilities, about accelerating the modernization work, to enable the business to go faster, to become more innovative, and become more productive. This year onwards, it's going to be about unlocking the future of shopping for our customers, meeting them in the shopping journey in a highly personalized omni fashion. In fact, we want to start serving our customers right when they start consuming content, social commerce. Now, on our associate side, we want to reduce the time that they spend on activities like inventory counting, making multiple trips to the back room for stocking, picking, all of this kind of stuff so that they can focus on serving our customers. And we are focused on building systems that optimize all aspects of inventory and do that in real time. Everything from how we get inventory from our suppliers, to keeping our products in stock, to fulfilling customer demand in the fastest and lowest cost way possible. We want to enable our merchants to focus on the art of merchandising, have the systems take care of everything else. The foundation that we\u2019ve built is truly helping us reinvent how we serve our customers, how we run our business. Really excited about the potential that we can unlock. Now, as I said in the beginning, technology will enable Walmart to move with speed, be more innovative, become more productive. And we see our role in technology as powering Walmart to lead the next retail disruption. And of course, that is well under way now. Doug McMillon : It sure is. Suresh, thank you for everything your team is doing. Thank you for the momentum that you're building. We covered a lot today. Thank you for your time and attention. Our focus is on our customers, on people, on the families we serve. And we are excited about getting even more aggressive. We have a strong, deep team and we will execute. We will strengthen this company in a way that benefits a lot of people for a long time to come. Now, we would like to give you a 5-minute break to grab a coffee and stretch your legs and when we come back, we will have a Q&A session that will include Brett, John, Judith, and Kath. Thank you all. Dan Binder : Thank you for joining our second Q&A session today. Just as a reminder, please unmute your Zoom when we call on you. With that, we will go to our first question from Oliver Chen with Cowen. And from there we will go to Ed Yruma at KeyBanc. Oliver Chen : Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much. Regarding technology, what are some of the learnings from India that will be most applicable to the U.S and also curious about edge computing and how that may play a role in thinking about leveraging stores in technology there? Doug McMillon : Yes. Judith, do you want to kick that off and maybe John, you can comment. Judith McKenna : Yes. So, hi there. I think that the leverage from India is really understanding how they're building out that ecosystem. We are starting to really see the difference that they're making for India in the way that they're joining together different bits of the platform that they've got and building out a flywheel albeit different to the flywheel that John described for the U.S. We've got some interesting things happening. They're building out our tech, for example, as well. Now, that is a developing market, so slightly different to the U.S., but we're just about to start a trial in our Chile business using the Flipkart Ad Tech app, which is really helpful to a similar kind of market to be able to trial out two benefits to that. The first is, of course, Chile benefits from that, but secondly Flipkart learn how to produce commercial-grade tech which potentially might have a future for them as well. So, we learn a lot, it's not just about the tech, but about how they approach things, and about how they're building out a broader flywheel as well. John Furner : Yes. Thanks, Judith and Oliver, good to see you. Thanks for the question. Now, I think I would just frame up the answer by saying one of the extraordinary things about Walmart is we are local in about 5,000 communities, and that's been extremely advantageous in the last few years, but particularly last year as our teams did so much to serve communities all over the country. And this local presence has so much meaning in terms of being real in the community, our ability to serve customers in a number of ways whether it's picking up in a store, shopping in a store, using our local facilities as points of distribution and with the supply chain investments we are making. And your point on edge computing, it's a great one and it certainly does open up real possibilities for us considering we've got these properties all over the country where we're within about 10 miles and 90% of the population. And going forward, I think that's a huge advantage whether it's in our core retail business or some of the other income streams that we covered this morning. Doug McMillon : As it relates to edge compute, Oliver, this year's focus was on increasing the pie for the bandwidth into a lot of our stores because we imagine future use cases along the lines of what's Suresh talked about just a few minutes ago with an app that you can hold up and see which merchandise to pull forward. We will use handhelds for that for a period of time someday we may have wearables and we can imagine other enterprise users in addition to that example. And there may be excess capacity to monetize on top of that, we will just have to see how much we need ourselves. Dan Binder : Thank you, Oliver. Next we will go to Ed Yruma and then to Greg Melich after that. Ed Yruma : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first, you guys have kind of layout some very rough outlines and some interesting developments in your distribution capabilities. Can you talk a little bit about micro fulfillment, the last mile investments, are you seeing a step change in terms of the consumer that wants items delivered versus pickup and how does that change the longer term profitability of eComm? And then as a follow-up, you guys have done a great job kind of reformulating your international mix. How do we think about contribution longer term. Now you've tipped into kind of higher growth markets? Thank you. Doug McMillon : John, I might kick it off just by saying we made a deliberate choice years ago to focus on pickup in the U.S before focusing on delivery. We were doing delivery in the U.K and other markets, and Judith, we we're learning a lot from what Asda had done with delivery. But in the U.S., we thought, based on how large the country is and how people like to drive their cars and they do drive throughs for food and banks and everything else that we had the opportunity to really focus on pickup for a few years, which was obviously advantageous to us economically and those capabilities which we couldn't pay software from Asda to get started, which is great, those capabilities, actually, John, worthy unlock to productivity for delivery, which you're building on now. John Furner : Yes, I'm really glad that that work was done a few years ago, Judith, because it created the foundation for what is enabling what we are doing today and really just step back and think about what happened with the customer last year. The pandemic changed behavior in some ways, I'm sure it's temporary, but in many ways, these are permanent changes. And customers having the ability to shop in a store, or pickup, or deliver at their schedule or an attended or even within 2 hours of things that we are doing all over and if it weren't for the pickup capabilities that were happening in the store, all that wouldn't be possible today. So we talked about the growth of the last mile delivery. And that's always just a function of volume and density and neighborhoods and the more density you have, the more economic it is to deliver an entire range of goods. But we are excited about those businesses. You also mentioned local, what we're calling MFCs, market fulfillment centers. I'm really excited about the capabilities that adds for a couple of reasons. One, it will increase capacity. The increased capacity also helps stores manage what's going to be done on the sales floor, and what will be done in the fulfillment center. And then those fulfillment centers, they can serve broader areas including other stores. So the way that we are tying all the supply chain assets together with automation, and our fulfillment centers down to the last mile up to the point of delivery to and including inside the home. It's a really exciting proposition. Doug McMillon : The fact that we've attracted more new customers with the pickup and delivery services is also helpful. I think, there are a lot of folks who weren't shopping Walmart in the stores that once those services were available, they were excited to take advantage of them and try them and Kath that include Sam's Club where this year you've added a lot more curbside capacity. Judith McKenna : Yes. So we rolled it out across the whole network in June and have seen it successfully grow week on week ever since then. I'm excited to kind of explore how we can leverage synergies with Walmart from a delivery perspective, moving into the next year. Doug McMillon : I think, it's one of the drivers of membership growth, the fact that people could take advantage of Sam's without coming into building during the pandemic. Judith McKenna : Maybe just -- do you want me to pick up on the International and the growth piece? I will just build on the point that John was making, which is we're learning around the world by the way from last-mile delivery. The Spark platform that we have got, we got that starting in Canada. We got it delivered in Mexico. So, this is not just a U.S thing. This is around the world as well and the capabilities that we are building. A pretty universal and I think that's one of the unique things that we have. And the International mix, yes, we\u2019ve done a lot of changes this last year in International, you know the Asda deal just closed this week. And we are more focused on high growth markets as well, and each of those markets is a different place in its portfolio. So I'm excited to see how we continue to contribute to Walmart overall. But as Brett said, you will see us with the higher sales positioning than you\u2019ve seen in the past. And I think also businesses that are really building out and growing for the future as well. So it's an interesting and unique global footprint that we have got, the priority markets continue to be as they have always been, with Mexico, China, India, and Canada, but also we see strength in Chile and Africa coming back as well. Dan Binder : Thank you. Next we will go to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. You are on mute, Greg. Greg Melich : Sorry about that. Hope everyone is doing well in the weather there. I guess, two things. First for Brett, it's great to hear a CFO excited. And I guess what, one or two levers should we look to going forward to get the profit margin growing again into 2022 and beyond, if you were to pick all the initiatives you see out there? And then my second question, I think is for almost everybody, probably Doug, John, not really sure. If you look at that eCommerce business now, $65 billion how much of it is 3P? And as you get to $100 billion or $200 billion, how much you think that mix will change? And do you ultimately need to have your own drivers and assets to really scale the business? At what point of scale, would you need to have your own trucks drivers like in Amazon? Thank you. Brett Biggs : I'm glad you picked up on my excitement, Greg. And actually the question you asked is why I'm excited and very optimistic about what we can do as a company, because when we look at where we want the company to be financially, 2 years from now, 3 years from now, 5 years from now, there's a lot of different ways to get there. It doesn't have to take one track and that's what's so important with the other income areas that are growing significantly, Judith just mentioned International growth being more significant than it's been in the past. There's so many initiatives going on at Sam's Club that are driving sales and profit and membership. And then go to John's area, and there's so many things from talking about, again, the new revenue streams but also the general merchandise business, marketplace, and there's just a lot of ways to get to the place we want to be. Greg, if I go back several years ago, maybe that wasn't quite the case. I just like the optionality that we have as a company. I think it's -- it just opens up opportunities for us. John Furner : And Greg, on your question on mix, it reminds me back years ago when we were in general merchandise businesses and the Division 1s -- what we call Division 1 stores and then we bought grocery chains and we added those together and we created this magic mix of the supercenter. And as the formula started to work, we accelerated investments up to about 350 stores a year. And then if you think over the last 8 to 10 years or so, we had the Orange app, which we talked about, which was the copy of the Asda app. We had our Walmart.com app does have come together and that same sort of mix equation, it's really exciting to see it play out and for our merchants and we've got a fantastic merchant team. Now that they are in a position to have a category or a group of items or group of categories and be able to mix those across channels and channels being everything from 3P that's fulfilled by us 3P fulfilled by the sellers, then we've got our 1P commerce business which was strong last year and our store business, the lines are really starting to blur. And it's all about resetting how we think about the customer and offering the customer the very best experience across all the channels. And so having a 3P business, it's growing like it is and fulfillment services we see demand from sellers is accelerating. And we are really making sure that we think about sellers as a customer. I\u2019ve been spending time on Zoom calls, unfortunately we can't have meetings together, but my team and I\u2019ve been meeting with some of our largest sellers and we are listening to all the things that they need from us and we are enabling those capabilities so that Walmart can be a great platform for them, just like it is for suppliers and customers and all of our associates. So, this ability of our team -- for our team to be able to mix across channels in addition to the categories they serve is really exciting as we look forward. Doug McMillon : John, maybe a little bit more on last-mile. Our current arrangements includes Spark, our own independent contractor platform, which has been scaling and growing. We also have relationships with others that do this similar type of work. You've had some experiments going on with AV here locally there is a vehicle that's running around some experience with drones now trying different things, anything more on density or how you see last mile going forward? John Furner : Yes. For sure. Look, the customer is the boss and customer is number one. We've said that for years and what we\u2019ve to be able to do is deliver the way the customer needs to have a delivery done or fulfill the way they want to and it really depends on what's going on their life. So thinking about taking a neighborhood where we have got a number of customers who are customers of Walmart, who need to stay in stock or need to be delivered to, in addition, the same neighborhood will have people who are looking for a gift for a birthday for that week or they are inspired by some sort of content they saw online, whether it's someone else's platform or on our platform to be able to have density in neighborhoods is really important. And that includes items that will come from fulfillment centers and sellers and local stores, all of that down to the experiment, Doug, you mentioned which is we have got mans that are delivering in density here locally. We need great partners like FedEx for their runs that run from fulfillment centers, straight to people's homes. And then we are experimenting with aerial delivery, including drones. We have done COVID tests this year in communities. We have been able to launch some new items and deliver the first units sold from stores to places with drones. And so, Greg, I think the answer is, we're going to keep learning as we go. Some of these things we know are ready to scale. We have talked about mark fulfillment centers, our last mile businesses, it's over 1.5 million deliveries a week now, which is up about seven times from last year, which is exciting. And it's a really healthy blend of service providers and the Spark platform which enables people to drive on our behalf and behalf of others like Sam's Club in the future. Doug McMillon : Greg, like we do with our private fleet there are loads that we want to move. There are times when we use third parties to move those. I think, there'll be a hybrid approach here. Some mix of our assets and a whole lot of relationships with others to build out the entire network. Dan Binder : Thanks, Greg. Next we will go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett, and then to Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan after that. Chuck Grom : Good morning. Great, Thanks, everyone. Couple of questions from me. First, for Brett, COVID costs last year were around $4 billion, curious what's the embedded run rate this year and the guidance that you provided this morning? And then also how would you size up the wage costs headwind that you also announced this morning, relative to that $4 billion? And then second for, John, on related, I'm curious how you are planning the year from a category perspective, which areas do you think are going to do well and what areas of your business do you think we could see the release of some pent-up demand? Thanks. Brett Biggs : Yes. I will kick off, Chuck. Good to see you. So what we tried to do with guidance this morning, we said we are trying to give you best view we can given what we know is pull you up a little bit to a higher level. As we get down into the individual pieces of that guidance, there's a lot of different things that could happen in the year and how quickly do the vaccines take over and how quickly do we need to continue the cleaning and maintenance that we are doing that will continue for some time, we know that. So out of the $4 billion, there was a number of one-time bonuses that obviously is in that number and then there is a run rate in there. So, we do have a run rate going forward, obviously we have run rate on wages, getting into the details of that is not something that we are prepared to do this morning. But it's taking all of that, and looking at the variables that could cause one to go up, one to go down and then just looking at the most likely scenario and that's what we feel like we gave you this morning on sales and profit and breaking it down further in that, just we are trying to do that this morning. Doug McMillon : Probably the number one thing we need to get done is we need to get the country vaccinated. Brett Biggs : Yes. Doug McMillon : So, there's a lot of effort and -- time and attention into how we can help scale that effort. I think John, we are maybe 22 states last week, you might talk a little bit about vaccinations and the role we're playing as you talk about categories. John Furner : Yes, sure. Well, Chuck, good to see you. And, Brett, the year last year was extraordinary in a number of ways, and I do want to just thank our team for being so committed to safety and cleaning and it was an enormous lift everything from sourcing mask and like we've got today putting up plexiglass in 5,000 locations. They move mountains and we really did great job, they really did a great job of prioritizing associate safety customer safety and serving communities now which leads to vaccinations. We are here ready to help all across the country we've got close to 20,000 pharmacists and pharmacies ready to participate. And we've got capacity, well over $10 million, maybe up to $14 million per month that we can help to do so, we want to help to get the country vaccinated because it gets us moving back in the right direction. And the sooner we're able to do that the better it is for the economy and every part of the country. Chuck, on your question on mix, just think back to last year, the swings are pretty wild and they had impacts that stayed with us for some time. Last year in February, we saw people buying more OTC, in March, it was a big run in grocery in the stock up phase and then the general merchandise really took off at the end of April and into the second quarter and which resulted in a very, very high number of out-of-stocks and we really struggled with conditions and in stock for a couple of months because of the surges. So reflecting on what's happened this last quarter, it was a strong quarter. Growth was up 8.6% and they're also really proud of the team that the plan we put together, they were able to not only beat the -- the plan that they had, but grow at that level while being closed at day that we were open last year. We closed on Thanksgiving Day and that had an impact. We were just short of $100 billion for the quarter and I think that just a few more hours, Brett, probably would have made the difference. Brett Biggs : Yes. John Furner : But if I had to make the same decision again, I'd make the same decision and I would close for our associates who needed some time off. But in this last quarter, mix was pretty balanced. The food business, the consumable business was stronger. Health and wellness had a great quarter, and general merchandise also had a great quarter, which we saw nice share gains in November, December in general merchandise. So, what happened late in the quarter was a more balanced mix of categories than probably what we saw back -- different points of the year last year. Dan Binder : Thanks, Chuck. Next we will go to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. And then the Paul Lejuez at Citi. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for all the information. So, first, a question for Brett, and then I'll have a follow-up on PhonePe. So, in the 4% plus sales contract beyond this year, how are you thinking about the Walmart U.S. comp? And bigger picture, historically, you've been sort of a mid single-digit type earnings grower. Is the message today that with faster sales growth and the potential for more margin expansion that we could be thinking about more like a high single-digit type earnings algorithm long-term? Brett Biggs : Yes, Chris. Good to see. As you think about the 4% given the size of the business in US, you're not going to get to that number with pretty good growth in the U.S and you're seeing a lot of the capital that we're putting forward in fulfillment, innovation, automation, making sure that we can grow the top line in the U.S as quickly as we can. That's what we want to do. But having said that, International still being a big part of the business and having now a higher growth mix inside of International, that also helps as well. On the profit side, as I said this morning, we expect over time to grow operating income faster in the sales and that\u2019s what you should expect from us as investors. There is a lot of different ways to do that. One of the things that I believe will look a little different going forward is the pieces on gross margin and higher margin businesses, these evolving and growing new businesses we have higher margin mixes, general merchandise business getting stronger, helps mix that out as well as our contribution margin gets better in eCommerce that helps us well. So it's all these pieces starting to come together that gives us the opportunity to grow operating income faster than sales, which has been a little different than we've been in the past few years. Chris Horvers : Understood. And then as a follow-up on PhonePe. Can you talk about what are your longer-term thought process there on the strategy? Are you thinking about this as an opportunity to scale it globally to take some of the learnings back to other markets. And so thus it's a longer term commitment, or do you see this over the long-term as a monetization that provides fuel to reinvest in the core business. Thank you. Judith McKenna : Hi, Chris. Listen, PhonePe is an amazing business in its own right. It's -- Doug, and I were just reminding ourselves, it's just 4 years old and this time last year, when we were talking to all of you, I was wowed at the fact I could say it was doing 0.5 million -- 0.5 billion -- sorry, 0.5 billion transactions a month. And now I'm talking about them doing a billion. I think that just tells you the scale and the way that it's growing. We are really excited about what the long-term future for PhonePe looks like. That continuing on that strategy, which is send, spend, grow and manage, and we're supporting them through that strategy, as well. This has been a year where they consolidated and really thought about India. It's been a remarkable year in India overall and digital adoption in all its forms have stepped on, in particularly, on digital payment. So they\u2019re very much focused on the Indian market. At the moment, what the future looks like, they\u2019re helping us, advising us the markets like Mexico. But at the moment we want them to focus on India. The thing I think that we did this year which is interesting for them is we did a partial spinoff for them. And the reason for that is we\u2019ve two amazing business with Flipkart and PhonePe and what we were trying to do is set both up to maximize their potential in the long-term, so they can both build value. They can also really think about having dedicated capital which helps growth opportunities. Now, PhonePe is monetizing, as it goes through this. Like you\u2019ve heard consistently today, it's got an Ad Tech platform, many of the new areas such as mutual funds and such as insurance are accretive to them. But they are still in a growth phase at the moment. And one of the things actually that we shouldn't overlook and what we did this year is that we have now been able to create their own ESOP for that business, which best aligns them and the management team to what the future for them will look like. So we are very much interested in the long-term for them, but, yes, there will be a lot of learnings around the world. Doug McMillon : I think financial services is core. And we've got a great opportunity in India. We've had a financial services business obviously in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, other places. And it's so integral to commerce and create so many different use cases and opportunities to deepen the relationship with the customers save the money, which we've done well over time, but it's been more store-centric than what the future will look like. And because we want PhonePe to be focused on India primarily, we've taken a different approach in the U.S. John, you might elaborate more on it. John Furner : Yes. So, we announced a FinTech start-up with Ribbit Capital. We are really excited about that. I think ultimately having a great platform like Walmart, where people are looking for better ways to pay and pay in an omni-channel way, just really opens the doors for us to think creatively about a marketplace of products and services that are great for customers' financial wellbeing. And that's all possible because of the underpinning of our ability to create a trusting environment where people buy their food, they get their health and wellness services, including clinics from Walmart. And ultimately, this along with some of the other businesses we talked about, which I heard in your question, we're really confident that not only we have a path forward in some of these new areas but also in others, we've really got to path to scale. Things like the ad business, it's a sizable business that's growing fast and has a lot of room to scale. And just putting us at the center of the question, why is it possible because you have suppliers, you have sellers, and you have customers, all looking for ways to connect. So suppliers need services to reach customer groups, sellers need to reach customers and sellers need to buy from suppliers. And at the center, that was the reason that we decided to rename our business, which was we referred to previously as Walmart Media Group to Walmart Connect, because it connects those three parties together where they can get on with it and have a great business together. Dan Binder : Thanks, Chris. Next we will go to Paul Lejuez at Citi. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks guys. Lots of attention on wages tends to be on the SG&A piece of the equation, but I'm curious if you could talk about what you see from a top line perspective in seats where there has been some wage pressure in recent years. Do you see a sales lift in those areas. And then separately, just curious how you're thinking about the top line drivers in 2021 from a store over eComm perspective, traffic versus ticket perspective. And I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you comment on what you expect in terms of e-Comm profitability in 2021 versus 2020. Thanks, guys. John Furner : Probably a few things in there to unpack. So maybe, let's start with the associates at Walmart. And for years we've been really proud of the fact that we provide career opportunities, over 70% -- almost 75% of our managers start as hourly associates. I started as an hourly associate in 1993. And we're really proud of the career ladder. And as we step back and looked at, Chris, what's really happened in the last couple of years in stores specifically, we've seen that the work has changed because the way the customer shops has changed. So when Doug was talking about starting pickup back in the U.S., Judith probably 6 years ago or so, around 2015, that was a pilot experiment. It's now a sizable part of not only how customer shop, but it's what we do every day. So we took a step back and looked at the store and broke the store into really four big work groups. And the announcement this morning is to invest in two of the most critical work groups as we look to the next few years and that's stocking the store, maintaining inventory levels, and I'll talk about that in just a second, and then our digital business. What we're referring to it as the omni business, but it's really the pickup and dispense business, which includes dispensing to customers' cars or to delivery drivers. And so that's the way the customers are going to go. We're going to stay ahead of it. But When it comes to inventory availability, we've got to be right each and every day in stores for the in-store shopper and the picker who is trying to put an order together and dispense to a customer. And last year, different parts of the year, we had times of the year where we were proud of our in-stock position. We had other times where we had extreme pressure in the supply chain. And that would include availability, surges in business, we had the stock up phase, which left us in a position of out of stocks for a long amount of time. And so it's the right time for us to invest in those groups of associates and create a great career map for them. So that they not only want to come to work and stay with us, but they see future opportunities, including being a store manager, or being a regional operator, or being the CEO one of the businesses. So what we're trying to make sure we're doing is invest in a way that it's really clear to an associate who starts at Walmart this week, what their opportunities are, and how they accomplish it. Doug McMillon : Wage inflation generally speaking is good for us in every country where we operate, it's good for us in the United States. If a market is going up, it's also good for us if our associates wages are going up and they have more disposable income we're obviously the first place they think of. Many of them are working there every day. So we do want to see wages go up. We just got to get the pace right all things considered. And as it relates to eCommerce, Brett, do you want to comment on that? Brett Biggs : Yes. So as we said, that's been moving definitely in the right direction. We reduced losses this year significantly in the eCommerce business. And it's such an integrated part of our business. You did not miss it. We did not give guidance going forward on that. But you can imagine with the growth and profit algorithm that we laid out this morning, without continued progress in that, it would be tough to grow operating income faster than sales. So that should give you some indication of -- we assume that progress will continue. Doug McMillon : We just these days think of it as an omni P&L \u2026 Brett Biggs : Yes. Doug McMillon : \u2026 even more than ever. So we are -- I think Brett's done a nice job explaining it today, all these different pieces and variables. And we look at it holistically. And as we've shared before, we've got a cadence that we work through to manage the financials to decide where we're going to step on the gas, where we're going to be more conservative. The eComm P&L we won't lose sight of. We will still track obviously GMV sales, contribution profit by category, the fixed costs. We've got great visibility into that. But the customer relationship pulls stores and eComm together. And generally speaking, we are thinking about this as a holistic in omni business, not in silos anymore. Dan Binder : Thanks, Paul. That's going to conclude our Q&A session. We do appreciate all of your good questions. Doug? Doug McMillon : Yes, I'll just close by saying thank you. I mean, we know so many of you and appreciate the time and attention you pay to the company. Hopefully, most of you are aligned with our view. We are building this for the long-term, we are going to manage the short-term. There have been times these past few quarters where we've been able to have a positive surprise to the upside. We are going to go to work. We are going to execute. We are going to build for the long-term and manage the short-term as we go and you guys can give us feedback and hold us accountable based on the actual results. So we will get back to work. Hopefully, we will see a little bit of a warmer temperature around this part of the world and get a lot of our stores back open and get customers back in them and build from there. Thank you all. Brett Biggs : Thanks, everybody. Dan Binder : That will conclude our program. Thank you.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Dan Binder, Investor Relations. Dan Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to Walmart's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. I'm joined by a few members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart US. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you with an update on the business and discuss first quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning and thanks for joining today's call. Our results for the first quarter were strong. We're pleased with our sales momentum and adjusted EPS growth of 43% versus last year. We had strong performance in all three segments. As the pandemic continues, it's impacting the countries where we operate in different ways so our teams are adapting to overcome the challenges and deliver the strong results we're sharing today. We continue to be grateful to all of our associates for their dedication to serving others. 2021 brings its own unique challenges and uncertainty. But overall, my optimism is higher than it was at the beginning of the year for several reasons. In the US, economic stimulus is clearly having an impact, but we also see encouraging signs that our customers want to get out and shop. Our execution is improving despite the hurdles presented by the pandemic. The second half will likely have more uncertainty than a normal year, but we like our position. Our stores are getting stronger and our eCommerce capabilities are expanding as we continue to grow. Customers will decide how and when they want to shop and they will find us ready whether they want to shop in store, pick up an order or have it delivered. Key elements of our strategy are coming together nicely. We saw an acceleration of traffic in our stores, gained market share in grocery, improved in-stock levels and grew eCommerce sales globally by 43% in constant currency excluding recent divestitures. Global eCommerce penetration now represents over 12% of total company sales an increase of 340 basis points over last year. Looking ahead, we'll navigate the supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures whether that's in cost of goods or wages. We'll monitor our price gaps and adjust as appropriate with both customers and shareholders in mind. As it relates to COVID-19, the past several weeks have been more challenging in some countries. India, Canada, Chile and South Africa are priorities at the moment. Supporting our associates is our primary focus, but we're also investing our resources to support the countries as we find opportunities to do so. In India, we're donating oxygen concentrators, PPE and financial support. When it comes to helping people get vaccinated, we're engaged in multiple countries. In the US, we've administered millions of doses. We're taking steps to encourage our associates and everyone to become vaccinated. Given CDC guidance, our US associates that have been vaccinated can now work without a mask if they choose to and we've added a cash incentive as one more step to encourage vaccinations. All of our Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies in the US are administering vaccines and we can provide them without an appointment. We've also collaborated with national and local organizations to support more than 200 community events across the country so far. In India, we're facilitating vaccinations for our associates and their households and our Flipkart and PhonePe contractors more than 200,000 people. Across the countries where we operate we'll keep looking for more places to make a difference. This pandemic won't be over until it's over for everyone. In addition to combating the pandemic, we also announced a new commitment to US manufacturing during the quarter. Over the next 10 years, we've set a goal to purchase an additional $350 billion on items made, grown or assembled in the US. We estimate this commitment will create more than 750,000 new American jobs and avoid 100 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. We also want to make it easier for manufacturing in the US to flourish. That's why we're launching an initiative called American Lighthouses. We'll bring together partners from the supplier community, academia and government among other groups to identify and overcome top-down barriers to US production. We also have other exciting news to share as we continue to invest in the technologies of tomorrow. In collaboration with ENGIE North America, a power generator and services company, we're adding more than 500 megawatts to the US renewable grid through three separate wind projects. Together these projects are expected to supply renewable energy to hundreds of stores, clubs and distribution facilities annually. That's enough renewable energy to power over 240,000 average American homes for a year. That's on top of the 4-gigawatts of renewable energy currently supplied by our projects globally. This is one more example of the important work we're doing to become a regenerative company. Now let's talk more about our results for the quarter. Walmart US had another strong quarter. The team delivered for our customers as they shopped in our stores and online and additional government stimulus payments created a tailwind. Our comp sales of 6%, including 37% growth in eCommerce were strong. Strength was broad-based across categories including apparel, home, hardlines and seasonal. I've recently visited stores, clubs and supply chain facilities in New Jersey, Delaware, DC, Ohio, New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, California and Florida. I continue to be grateful for the job our associates are doing and I'm impressed by their spirit. They're operating safely in a pandemic, improving our in-stock and standards, working hard to fulfill pickup and delivery orders and vaccinating millions. Doing all those things at once isn't easy and we've had our challenges, but our associates continue to step up and they're strengthening our position as they do it. In the US our first-party retail business is strong, but we're also making good progress in other important parts of our business. Marketplace GMV, fulfillment services and advertising income with Walmart Connect are all strong. The flywheel we showed you in February is being built. Each component is positioning us to serve the customer better while diversifying the model. As we previously shared, the top of the flywheel starts with being the best first place people shop. Store remodels, investments in pickup and delivery capacity and sales of Walmart+ fall into this category of activities. We need more capacity to get ahead of demand and we remain convinced these investments are smart ones. This is one of the keys to selling more Walmart+ memberships, which is an important piece of our strategy over time. In addition to work at the top of the flywheel, we'll continuously add brands, assortment and capabilities to our eCommerce general merchandise business with first-party inventory and marketplace expansion. We'll invest in our general merchandise business and grow in higher-margin categories. The announced acquisition of Zeekit is a great example. This startup combines fashion and technology through a dynamic virtual fitting room and underscores the desire to grow our apparel business aggressively. We continue our work to build a larger health and wellness business and help customers and associates have a better experience when it comes to their healthcare. Our acquisition of MeMD is a big step in that direction. Adding a telehealth capability was important. Just as we're doing with core retail, we're building an omni-channel health and wellness business. At Sam's Club, the momentum continues. Our items are improving, membership and sales comps are strong and the team keeps adding and scaling capabilities like curbside. We're seeing strength in categories associated with social gatherings as well as an increase in business member activity. Categories like restaurant supplies are coming back. We saw tremendous growth in membership income for the quarter and overall membership counts are at an all-time high. Like our stores business, government stimulus helped our results, but I'm confident the underlying business is strong and moving in the right direction for our members. Our international team has been busy transitioning the portfolio to higher-growth markets and it's working. As you'll recall, we recently divested our businesses in the UK, Japan and Argentina. And as a result, net sales for the quarter declined about 11% year-on-year. On a like-for-like basis when we remove the recently divested markets, net sales increased 5.1%. These are good results and demonstrate the segment's ability to deliver growth for the enterprise. In India for the first quarter, Flipkart and PhonePe continued to experience strong growth as annualized total payment value run rate at PhonePe grew by more than 150% versus last year. At Flipkart monthly active customers and users are key metrics and we're performing well. Our recent announcement of our intent to acquire Cleartrip, a leading online travel company underscores our commitment to transform the customer experience through digital commerce. Our growing base of customers means we need to continue to add new capabilities including areas such as logistics and data storage. The recently announced partnership with Adani Group will help us do just that. Walmex continues to be strong and the flywheel is coming to life. Our assets in this market uniquely position us to serve customers in new ways. And they're responding. In Mexico sales in eCommerce increased 166% and our same-day delivery service is now available from 680 locations. Similar to the U.S., we're expanding our business to include more than just traditional retail. A few areas of note include the advertising business, which saw an increase of more than 100% in new advertisers. And our new mobile phone services network that provides voice, data and home broadband, bringing access and value to our customers. We doubled the number of users of these services during the quarter, as customers enjoy the convenience of adding data to their plan, right at the checkout. In China, our eCommerce business in Sam's Club continued to resonate with customers and members. Helped by a strong Chinese New Year, the club business delivered strong sales across all categories, leading to double-digit comp sales growth. We grew overall eCommerce sales 60%, on top of impressive growth last year. Results from our business in Canada were good, even as lockdown measures intensified as the quarter progressed. We started with strong sales in stores and eCommerce, but COVID-19-related restrictions on sales of certain merchandise categories towards the end of the quarter pressured our performance. The underlying business is strong. And we're confident in our omnichannel model for this market. I'll close today by, thanking everyone for a strong quarter. It all starts with our associates and their focus on serving our customers and members. We're being aggressive in dialing up innovation and speed. We're moving fast to learn new skills and to sharpen our edge on existing ones. And we'll move even faster, as we invest in key areas to accelerate growth into the future. Thank you for your interest in our company. Now I'll turn it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug. We're pleased with strong first quarter results and the continued momentum in the business, with both, strong sales and profit growth. While stimulus spending benefited results it's exciting to see the continued progress in our underlying business, as we execute on the fundamentals and progress with our omni strategy. Newer businesses within our ecosystem like advertising and fulfillment services are growing rapidly, helping margins and allowing us to continue to invest in other strategic priorities. Our unique assets, value proposition and financial strength put us in a great competitive position to win, keeping the customer at the center of all we do. As we expected we're growing grocery market share again in the U.S., compared to last year, according to Nielsen. Value and assortment will continue to resonate with customers, as does the convenience we provide with our omni shopping options. Now let's discuss Q1 results. As we've mentioned previously, the divestitures in the U.K., Japan and Argentina significantly affect year-over-year comparisons. We outlined the anticipated effect of divestitures on key financial metrics, when we provided guidance in February, so my comments today will focus on the underlying business excluding the effect of divestitures. Total constant currency revenue growth was strong, up 5.8% to more than $132 billion, with underlying business trends continuing to improve, while stimulus spending benefited U.S. sales even versus last year's consumer stock-up phase and initial stimulus. Walmart U.S. comp sales were stronger than expected up 6% in the quarter and up 16% on a two-year stack. Sam's Club grew comp sales nearly 11%, excluding fuel and tobacco. And international sales growth was strong, increasing more than 5%, in constant currency with strength in India, Canada and China. Globally, eCommerce sales growth remains robust at more than 40%. Gross profit margin increased 96 basis points led by, Walmart U.S., reflecting mix shifts due in part to stimulus spending, lower markdowns and lapping last year's COVID-related stock-up which was more focused on food and consumables. As expected, SG&A expenses were pressured by increased wage and technology investments in the U.S., partially offset by lower COVID-related costs resulting in 21 basis points of deleverage. Overall, though, I feel good about expense focus across the company. Operating income on a constant currency basis was up over 28%. And adjusted EPS of $1.69 was 43% higher than last year's Q1 adjusted EPS. The divested businesses contributed $0.07 of EPS, due to partial period ownership in the quarter. GAAP EPS was $0.97 which includes net losses on our equity investments as well as the incremental loss in international divestitures. Operating cash flow declined about $4 billion due primarily to inventory increases versus last year when in-stock levels were much lower, due to stock-up shopping. We stepped up buybacks during the quarter with $2.8 billion of share repurchase. We continue to feel great about the value of the company. Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter, aided by, stimulus spending and underlying improvements in the grocery business as well as strength in reopening categories such as, travel, celebration and personal care. We're particularly encouraged by the improving trends in store transactions, which turned solidly positive in April for the first time in a year. We also saw strong market share gains in grocery according to Nielsen and continued strength in eCommerce. Comp sales excluding fuel increased 6% resulting in a strong two-year stack comp of 16%. Sales strength is broad-based across channels with eCommerce sales growth of 37%. The omni strategy continues to resonate as customers utilize all the shopping options we offer and we continue to expand pickup and delivery capacity from stores. Customer trip consolidation led to nearly 10% increase in average basket size with 3% fewer transactions. Strong sales trends were led by apparel home and lawn and garden. Grocery sales declined against the uniquely tough comparison, but comps were up low double-digits on a two-year stack basis including mid-teens growth in food categories helped by strong price positioning, improving in-stocks and expanded store hours relative to last year. We're pleased with the progress of strategic growth initiatives such as Walmart Connect advertising, eCommerce marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. Advertising revenue was robust with triple-digit growth for the quarter. Gross profit rate was strong, up more than 140 basis points reflecting favorable mix shift to higher-margin general merchandise categories and lower markdowns. Margins were also helped by lapping last year's COVID-related closures of vision centers and auto care centers. SG&A expenses deleveraged 49 basis points as increased associate wage investments and increased technology spend were partially offset by an approximate $400 million reduction in COVID-related costs versus last year. Operating income was very strong, up nearly 27%. Inventory increased 16% reflecting strong sales growth and lapping last year's COVID-related effects on inventory. We continue to monitor industry challenges related to transit and port delays and our merchants have taken steps to mitigate the challenges, including adding extra lead time to orders. The fundamentals of the US business continue to improve and we're confident we have the strategy structure and people in place to serve customers and reach our goals this year and beyond. International delivered strong Q1 results with net sales growth of 5.1% in constant currency, including strength in India, Canada and China despite many markets being negatively affected toward the end of the quarter by a resurgence of COVID. The benefit of strategic portfolio realignment to focus on higher-growth markets is becoming more evident in top line growth. eCommerce sales increased approximately 64% and penetration grew more than 570 basis points to about 16% of sales. Currency benefited sales by approximately $0.7 billion. Comp sales in Mexico declined slightly against a tough comparison, but were up low double-digits on a two-year stack basis as the omni-channel strategy continues to accelerate. The Mexico business has made good progress expanding alternative revenue and profit streams within the ecosystem, including doubling the number of digital advertisers and continued to see strong growth in mobile services. Canada comps increased 3.4% with more than 115% growth in eCommerce sales, despite headwinds later in the quarter from COVID-related government restrictions on the sales of non-essential categories like apparel and general merchandise. China comps increased 1.3% and were up 13% on a two-year stack. Strong Chinese New Year sales continued strength of Sam's Clubs and eCommerce growth of 60% all contributed to the result. Flipkart continues to perform well driving strong and sustainable eCommerce GMV growth and strong trends in monthly active customers and users even as the teams deal with the challenges of resurging COVID cases in India. International operating income was strong, up more than 21% as better sales mix and fewer markdowns in certain markets benefited margins in addition to continued focus on expenses. The momentum at Sam's Club continued in the first quarter with comp sales growth of 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco due in part to stimulus spending. On a two-year stack basis, comps were up nearly 27%. Comps benefited from both increased ticket and transactions. Strength was broad-based across categories with home and apparel leading the way. eCommerce sales were strong increasing 47% led by strength in curbside pickup at the club. We're pleased with the continued strong membership trends, as membership income grew about 13%. We achieved a new high for overall membership counts during the quarter and saw higher renewal rates including strong first year renewals and rising plus penetration. Operating income increased more than 16% in Q1, but excluding the negative impact of fuel profit increased 33%. Now let's turn to guidance. Our typical practice is to not update guidance until the second quarter release, but we're in an unusual period where Q1 stimulus led to meaningful sales and profit tailwinds that weren't contemplated when we provided guidance in February. The guidance discussed here assumes that COVID conditions continue to improve and there won't be significant additional government stimulus packages for the remainder of the year. We now anticipate higher full year enterprise sales growth than originally projected primarily due to the strong Q1 performance in our initial forecast for Q2. Excluding the impact of divestitures, consolidated net sales growth is now expected to be up low to mid single-digits versus our original guidance low single-digit increase. We're also raising full year guidance for operating income and EPS to reflect the strong performance in Q1 and our expectation for a potentially better second quarter than previously expected. On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of divestitures, we now expect full year consolidated operating income to increase by high-single-digits for the year, and EPS to increase by low-double-digits, which is an increase from our prior guidance of, both being flat to up slightly. Walmart US operating income is now expected to increase high-single-digits versus our original guidance of a slight increase. The second quarter started off a bit better than originally anticipated as stimulus spending continues to benefit certain general merchandise categories and we expect grocery market share gains to continue. We now anticipate Q2 EPS, excluding divestitures, will be up low-single-digits and it assumes a low-single-digit Walmart US comp sales increase, excluding fuel. The COVID pandemic continues to create both tailwinds and headwinds for our business. While Q1 was aided by stimulus spending, primarily in the US, certain international markets continue to be negatively affected by the resurgence in COVID cases and related government restrictions on operations, particularly in India and Canada. Given continued uncertainty, we're maintaining our original guidance for the back half of the year, and we'll update you as we gain clarity on key external variables related to the health crisis and their potential impact on our business and the global economy. Again, I'm very pleased with the first quarter results and feel good about the underlying strength of the business. Thank you for your time and interest this morning, and we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, and our first question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to focus on grocery, because you've obviously mentioned that a couple of times this -- in this conference call and the presentation. But I guess what I'm wondering is, what is your approach to pricing, given the price gaps that we're seeing with conventional? And that combined with the fact that we're seeing unprecedented cost inflation? And I guess maybe asking it a little differently. With respect to your broader goals for 2021, how important is recapturing share in grocery? John Furner : Hey. Good morning. This is John Furner. Thanks for the question. First, let me just start by saying a big thank you to our associates and our team around the country, who helped us deliver the quarter. And on the heels of such an interesting year last year, they've done a great job improving conditions both in store and online, and we're really proud of their performance in food. I'm glad to start with that question. Over the quarter, we've seen a lot of progress in food with our inventory, considering we started the quarter with a very large ice storm that affected supply chains, and then as we noted late in the quarter, performance that resulted in market share gains in food. There's a view of this that we showed back in February, which is our flywheel and the top of the flywheel is our food and consumable business and our supercenter business, which is really important to the customer journey. And over the last 12 months, -- specifically on your question on price, over the last 12 months we saw our price gaps improve versus the market and our merchants are working hard to ensure that that will continue. These market share gains that we saw in the latter part of the quarter are very encouraging, and it's great to see that we're positioned well when customers need to shift. When customers shifted last year to shopping online, we were able to perform at that time. And then, we've seen some shift back in the store in the quarter and the performance that's represented in the first quarter is a reflection of that. So, we feel good about the price gaps. These are the things that you always work on considering how many levers merchants have and everything going on in the market. But we feel good about our position in the market, and we'll continue to focus on share gains the rest of the year. Karen Short : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Paul Trussell : Good morning and strong results. Just wanted to dig a little bit more on your updated guidance for the year, maybe if you can give a little bit of color as it relates to the improvement in your 2Q expectations. And then, just provide a little bit more context on how you're thinking about first half versus second half of the year. Brett Biggs : Hey Paul, this is Brett. Good to hear from you. Yes, I mean, we -- as we got through the first quarter and we started understanding how strong the underlying business is. As John said, it started out a little challenging with the weather we had in February. But we saw the business strengthening as we went through the quarter. And certainly, some of that is going to be stimulus that we readily admit that. But you're seeing customers get back out again, because it feels like things are opening back up, particularly in certain parts of the country. So we felt like it was the right time to go ahead and update guidance different than we typically do given the strong performance. And then what we've seen in the early parts of the second quarter, we felt that we should go ahead and update guidance as we did. We haven't said anything really about the back half. We -- as I said in my comments, still a lot of uncertainties that are out there with headwinds, with tailwinds and they will play themselves out over the next several months. But I think all of us feel more confident than we did in February and felt like updating guidance was the right thing to do at this point. Doug McMillon : Paul, this is Doug. I would just add that when we imagine back-to-school Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and what families are going to want to do, we get really excited about the potential of that and are buying in a consistent way with how we're imagining it. Paul Trussell : Thank you. And just a really quick follow-up. Just on the margins, just digging a little bit more in 1Q. Brett, could you talk a little bit more about what was the impact of the strategic wage and technology investments that you made? Brett Biggs : Yeah. I mean, I'll talk -- I'll start with gross margin. I mean gross margins obviously were up significantly in the US about 140 basis points. You had really strong general merchandise sales this year, but you're comparing that against the quarter last year that was very heavily influenced by food and consumables. So you get that dynamic on gross margin. Certainly, the wage investments had an impact. I won't get into the specifics of that. It did cause us -- primarily cause us deleverage in the first quarter, but we knew that was coming. We're glad we did that and certainly ahead of the environment you're seeing right now, wage increases, tech investment increases as well. But it's offset by some other things from -- that we're leveraging across the company Paul. I still feel good about the overall expense discipline and focus that I see across the company. And as we said, when we get through this year with the increased wage investments going forward, I still feel good about our ability to leverage long-term. Paul Trussell : Thank you. Best of luck. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. So I have maybe two part question, but I'll make it one question. First, you referred, Doug and Brett, in the transcript a lot of mentions of alternative profit streams or profit pools. Can you talk about your visibility around the business? And if these pools are giving you more confidence in sort of how you're managing the business, it gives you more I guess wherewithal to invest back into it? And then the second part of the question is Doug you mentioned the flywheel and you're investing in capacity ahead of growth. Any update on when there could be an inflection? Or is it rolling? Or does it start at some point in the next fiscal year where you're at a good place and maybe push a little bit harder on Walmart+? Thank you. Doug McMillon : Yeah. Simeon, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to alternative profit pools, John, can chime in here as well, but I'm excited about marketplace. I'm excited about what's happening with fulfillment services. Walmart Connect performance was good. We do have strong visibility into that. And you're starting to see it happen in Mexico too. And as we've said to you before, this is -- this strategy makes sense for us everywhere in our key markets. So the P&L is starting to change its shape, as we described in February even more than a year ago and that does give us some room. John Furner : Good morning, Simeon, this is John and I'll just add on and say that we are excited about the three areas mentioned : Marketplace; WFS Walmart Fulfillment Services; and Connect like said earlier. Really optimistic about the results with Walmart Connect with triple digit growth. That platform is something that we've been working on for a while. And as we talked to you a few months ago, it helps connect buyers, sellers and suppliers in a way that's unique to Walmart. And optimistic about what we see there. On fulfillment services, it's great to see the team expanding capacity. We know we have seller demand. My team and I have spent a number of hours listening to sellers, talking to sellers and figuring out all the tools that we need to add. So this is important for their businesses as well. And then as we said in the quarter, we had 37% growth in eCommerce on top of a big number last year. We've basically doubled the business the last couple of years. So excited about all three of those. And they're clearly businesses that will help us with our flywheel going forward. Doug McMillon : As it relates to capacity getting ahead of growth, it's starting to happen. The plan that we had for the year is being executed. And as you're in stores, you can see the stress that, some of our stores are under in terms of the volume going through for pickup and delivery orders. And in some stores we're expanding space, capital is going towards that. In some stores, we'll be putting in automation to really press the top end of this thing, where we know we're going to have that kind of demand. And the team is executing against that. And we continue Simeon to be excited about it. And we'll go as fast as we can go this year and do it well. And I think we'll learn a lot from it. And we're very confident that, that capacity is going to be needed. Simeon Gutman : Thank you, best of luck. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Bob Drbul : Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions, I mean, largely around gross margin, and pricing and inflation. Just wondered, if you can talk a little bit about, what you're seeing, on the inflationary side different categories. And so you did mention balancing between customers and shareholders. Just sort of how you're approaching that? And sort of tying it together, when you look at the consumer, focused more on value versus convenience just wondered, if you could maybe give us a few examples on, where you think you're making progress around that value offering in this environment? Thanks. John Furner : Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is John again. First, as we said, we're really pleased with the performance in food. And the team has just done a great job getting the entire supply chain back in stock, including stores. You've got changes in the stores, where we're shifting more of our stocking to overnight, so we can free up more capacity during the day for things like picking as Doug said, and do that in a way that's conducive to customer shopping, so, excited to make those changes. As far as price gaps, we've always had a principle here that, everyday low price is important. In the quarter, we had about 30% more rollbacks in stores than what we would have had a year ago. Some other things that are important are the mix, not only the mix in the entire box, but the mix within food, pleased with the share gains that happened in meat and produce and bakery. So even within the food categories the mix has been favorable to categories that tend to have better margins, which is enabling us to maintain price positions that we -- that, we've been running. And our gap expanded last year versus the market. We're pleased with the gap. We're proud of the gap. And we'll continue to use all the levers we can to maintain those kinds of price gaps. The merchants at Walmart, this year are even more prepared than years in the past, to be able to manage that because of the channels they mix. Our merchants across the business can manage the channels from stores to eCommerce first-party, eCommerce third-party. And then finally, with the additional revenue and profit streams we mentioned with Walmart Connect, marketplace and fulfillment services that will just help us going forward with mix to make sure that we have the right gap for customers. I do agree with you that, value is -- it could be more important than convenience last year, but value has been an important pillar of ours for a very long time. Doug McMillon : This mentality that John described, related to rollbacks is important to underline. It applies in international it applies in Sam's Club as well. Bob, I'm reminded, of a conversation in the early '90s. As an assistant buyer in food my supervisor walked into the room with a few of us and said, \"We're short on our profit number for the month. I need you all to find price reductions that you can put in place quickly bring them to me by the end of the day.\" And I thought I misheard him. How do you lower prices and increase profit? And that's the beauty of retail and of mix and these supercenters. And now with eCommerce and marketplace and fulfillment services and Walmart Connect, we've got all these levers to be able to find places to go upstream do things differently than other people are doing it. So to have 30% more rollbacks in place right now in Walmart U.S. for example positions us really well. Bob Drbul : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I know that in-stocks, was an area that you mentioned during 2020 that was hard to manage, given the strong demand. Just wondered, currently are there any areas within your inventory of categories that are light or you're still working to build back? Thanks. John Furner : Hey. Good morning and thanks for the question. Certainly, 2020 was a challenge, when it comes to inventory flow with all the phases, we went through from the stock-up phase to people moving into their home and then demand and supply chain challenges all across that were related to pandemic. Early in the quarter, I felt like we were making pretty good progress and then we had this ice storm where we had just a record number of locations closed for a few days which put some stress on the supply chain. And then as we got later into the quarter, certainly we see improvements in our food and consumable business compared to what they would have been a year ago. In general, general merchandise has been a bit mixed. It's better in many cases, but there are some pockets where we continue to chase demand things like adult bicycles, some of our categories in consumer electronics. We're monitoring things like delays at the ports and other factors in the supply chain. And we'll watch all those things closely to continue to react. But definitely some pockets in general merchandise that we're still chasing even as we speak today. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Hi. Good morning, guys. I just had a question on US eCommerce maybe for John. Just obviously, the pickup activity continues to scale. But just curious on the home delivery front maybe what you're pushing on there just any updates. And also your micro or market fulfillment center tests just curious kind of how you're approaching that. And just your thoughts on kind of the home delivery side of fulfillment of eCommerce? Thanks. John Furner : Sure. Sure, Peter. Thanks for the question. In general, we have been working on capacity improvements and capacity growth when it comes to online pickup and delivery from stores. And that's something that we have been tackling for some time now. It accelerated last year and we managed things what we call things like slot utilization or available slots and we have more slots available for picking for scheduled orders than we've ever had. We also have more capacity to ship from store which leads to I think the second part of your question which is the in-home or the delivery at home. And I'd say a couple of things there. And number one, we are expanding our -- what we call our Walmart in-home services, which we just picked up another market and that's where we deliver food and other items from stores all the way into the home, including in the refrigerator. We have our market fulfillment centers that you asked about. We have several that are in construction. We expect to be launching those either late Q2 or early Q3. So we'll be able to talk about that more once those launch. And then finally, we are excited about our last mile business. We've been operating our first delivery vans that are Walmart-branded in a market here in Arkansas and we're learning a lot as we go forward. But we see lots of opportunities to serve customers whether it's in store, it's at their home or it's at the curb and they want to do pickup. We want to be extremely flexible and be able to serve customers any way they want. Last year there was such a shift of people that were wanting to have deliveries shifted at home from shopping in store. I think what we'll see more this year is a balance between the at-home deliveries, shopping in-store and pickup as people get back out. But as Brett alluded to earlier that's assuming that conditions of the pandemic continue to improve. And we'll be ready should there be change in either direction. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you quantify two of the comments that you made in the script? One was from Brett who noted that the guidance increase was mostly due to stimulus-related spending. So how do you parse out the 1Q results and what you're expecting in 2Q of the impact from the stimulus? And two Doug noted that Walmart+ is an important driver overtime. So can you give us a sense for where that program stands today and how it should unfold from here? Thank you so much. Brett Biggs : Hi, Michael. This is Brett. Good to hear from you. Yes, I mean, a couple of things I mentioned in various ways in the script is the underlying business feels good and we're more optimistic about that part of it. Certainly, stimulus benefited our results in the first quarter. But you can also get a sense of how we increased the second quarter. You know what the original guidance was and how we increased the guidance for that quarter. So that should give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about stimulus versus the underlying business. I can tell you though it is challenging to pick out exactly the impact of stimulus because of the types of categories that you see benefited by stimulus are also categories you see benefited by the economy opening up particularly on the general merchandise side. So it makes it a little more challenging to pick through that. Doug McMillon : Michael, on membership inside Walmart, this is a new program for us. The number one driver of selling memberships is the grocery supercenter pickup and delivery. And as we said before capacity is our issue there. And as we said in February, our focus is on the quality of that experience not the quantity. We want some time to work on NPS. We want to build capacity. We are marketing the program and long-term it will be important to us. But we've gotten so many other things going on. With stores improving in traffic and eCommerce growing and marketplace and all that kind of stuff we just -- we don't think that Walmart+ should be the primary focus at the moment for us with all these other opportunities. So we'll keep growing it. At some point I'm sure, we'll share some more information with you guys about it. I know there's a request for that because of streaming services and how much people are talking about subscriptions and memberships these days. So that's \u2013 John, I don't know if you want to add anything, but that's how I feel about it right now. John Furner : Yes. I completely agree. And the big thing that we're doing is creating capacity to be able to serve more and we have begun work on market fulfillment centers where we can use locations as hubs for other stores and spokes. We've got a lot of really encouraging supply chain work going on that would help us use the right algorithms to be able to pull inventory from all across the network and be able to serve people. So encouraging just in the last few months to see that not only the capacity has gone up, but eCommerce results have been strong, delivery from stores has been strong, delivery from fulfillment centers has been strong. So these capabilities we're putting in place will be a great foundation for this program as we move forward. Doug McMillon : I think the digital relationship with customers is important and that takes various forms. We've seen with the app downloads for example and app popularity; and what happened last year in particular with pickup and delivery a really large expansion in the number of digital relationships, which helps us with data and helps us be a retailer of the future. Overall, we feel good about what's happening in those areas. John Furner : Yes, those relationships, I believe will continue to grow because of things like the improvements in technology. We're working on improving the app and its core experience. Acquisitions like Zeekit and MeMD are also other ways that customers will be able to connect with Walmart effectively and we'll be able to help them with more and more in their life and take friction out make things simple for them. Michael Lasser : Very helpful commentary. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Proceed with your question. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We had a question on general merchandise improvements. You've talked a lot about food, but I'd like to give you some time to talk about general merchandise. You've brought in new talent there. You've made some strategic tuck-in acquisitions and some strategic partnerships as well. So help us think about what we should be looking for in terms of progress on general merchandise? And maybe if you could tie that back to some of your initiatives around marketplace as well, what you're learning from your digital growth that might be driving some of your in-store decisions around general merchandise? Thank you. John Furner : Sure. Let me take that one. This is John, again. We're really excited about the performance in general merchandise in the quarter. As you mentioned, we did make a number of changes with talent over the last year. Or the biggest change was last July when we pulled all of the channels together. And traditionally we had teams of people we called category specialists that were online and then we had buyers that were in-store. And we're referring to them all as merchants because the merchants now have the customer relationship across all channels. And the team has spent a lot of time thinking through and working on the right programs to determine what in our assortment goes in store, what's 1P and then what's 3P. And I'll give you an example. Just last week, I was in Minneapolis visiting one of our suppliers, Nordic Ware who makes cookware here in the United States. And we went through the number of items that they have in stores, what's doing well, what's going to improve? And then their entire catalog is available in the marketplace. And so our merchants were able to manage the assortment across channels and that gives them more levers to be able to serve the customer in a way that's frictionless and very clear. But in the quarter, we definitely saw some changes with the way customers shop, partly due to stimulus, but also just behavior changes. Brett talked about it earlier, categories like personal care, improving travel is starting to really kick back in. And when you look at all the categories that are selling at Walmart, you can tell a lot about what's going with customers across the country. So we definitely saw behaviors that are starting to reflect more opening up and getting back out and going to see people. Our health and wellness business has been extremely helpful in administering millions of vaccines in the quarter. And then with some of the changes even in the last week, we expect that some of these changes with the customer could continue, but we'll continue to watch that as the year moves on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Edward Yruma : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, some very positive commentary on store traffic, I know you noticed -- or you noted that April saw an inflection. When you see that store traffic begin to really improve, are you seeing any other changes within the eComm business either pickup or delivery? And then as a follow-up, as that traffic improves are you seeing any favorable mix shifts? Thank you. John Furner : For the traffic in store, the count of traffic, as we said, definitely changed in April, probably late March a bit. That's when we started to cycle some of the really big stock-up trips and what was happening last year where fewer trips and big consolidation, it did put a lot of strain and stress on inventory and things like paper goods and food and consumables. So this year would not -- as that shift began to occur and we saw the sheer numbers begin to reflect gains in the food categories. I think it was a combination of people getting back out in comparison to last year, but also some normalization in terms of frequency of food that's purchased, specifically within channels, strong growth between all three. As we said, in the US, the total comp was 6%, including eCommerce growth of 37%. And then eCommerce growth is a mix of, what's being shipped to people's homes from fulfillment centers or stores and inclusive of pickup. Finally, I'd just say that we continue to expand capacity in all channels. We're excited about the expansion of slots available for shopping in stores. We're excited about the amount of capacity we have in stores to ship to people's home. And then, we're continuing to work and invest in the supply chain to have more capacity going forward for pure first-party eCommerce. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Michael Baker : Thanks guys. Just two follow-ups, if I could. One, the 100 basis points or so gross margin improvement, can you sort of parse that out? And then, how much is coming just from the mix from general merchandise and how much is being supported by the strength in the alternative businesses, and if not, an exact quantification maybe directionally. And then the second question, just to follow-up on the comp guidance. So, first quarter was better than expected, second quarter guidance is up. Yet the full year comp, if I'm understanding it correctly, didn't change. So, should we read into something -- is that a decline in the back half? Or just too early to change it? Or \u2013 low-single-digits is a pretty wide range I suppose. It could be anywhere between 1% and 3% or 4%. So, what do we read into that not changing the full year guidance? Thank you. Brett Biggs : Hey, this is Brett. I appreciate the question. Yes, I think on the -- I'll start with the second one on comp guidance. What you said about low-single-digits being a fairly wide range that is the case, it is a wide range. And it's -- when you look at the big numbers of Walmart US, it ends up at in a really wide range. So, I wouldn't read anything into that. We feel great about the first quarter and the second quarter started out pretty well as we've said. On gross margin, I'll say -- start. John you can come in. The biggest change of course, was the general merchandise sales strength that we're seeing this year versus the consumable strength that we saw last year in the first quarter. And also, when you start seeing strength in general merchandise, which we've had really over the last several quarters, you see fewer markdowns. There's a lot of add-on benefits that come from that for gross margin. John Furner : Yes. Let me just add a bit on to the margin question. Certainly, there was strength in general merchandise in the quarter. We talked about the strength in food. And food was more balanced this year than what we would have seen last year. Last year, we were really heavy in dry grocery and stock-up items as the pandemic began. So, the strength and share gains that we saw in the first quarter in food, most specifically, meat produce, bakery and grocery, but leading in the fresh areas is certainly helpful. The third point I think I'd make is inventory positioning at the end of the quarter. Our inventory level is up, which is a good thing. Last year we had big stock-outs in grocery and in general merchandise, so I feel much better about our inventory position. Brett -- as Brett mentioned, our inventory is clean and we've been really disciplined about ensuring that we're clearing up end-of-season and seasonal. So, we feel great there. And then, the last thing I would say is, the drivers of eCommerce contributed to profit rates have been strong. Having merchants in the position of having all channels in their remit given the category and what the customer wants is helping with the drivers of eCommerce, which would include things like contributed profit rates, Walmart Connect, et cetera. Michael Baker : Great. Thank you. I appreciate that color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking our questions. Also wanted to touch a little bit on general merchandise. So with -- in the U.S. so with low 20% growth. Just curious if you think you gained market share there. We were thinking maybe 26% market growth, which is rough estimate. But just curious how you're thinking about that, how you measure that? And also how your efforts with Walmart fulfillment services and third-party are maybe contributing to your general merchandise growth? John Furner : This is John. Let me take your first question first. The share performance in general merchandise we think is about flat to last year and we manage it a month in arrear so our data is for February and March. So we feel good about the performance on through the first two-thirds of the quarter. Certainly saw as you said strength across general merchandise in the 20% range. So I think we're positioned well. Feel good about where the share is versus a year ago. Particularly excited about performances in categories like home and apparel in the quarter and the positioning we have going into the second quarter. Certainly some tightness in the supply chain as we mentioned earlier in select categories where we've had high demand and stresses in the supply chain. But we're watching that carefully and feel good about the improvements in in-stock all across the business including the fulfillment centers and stores. But again I think we're most encouraged by the demand and seeing things like travel and other things open up, and being able to be ready for customers is important as we move forward. And then the second part of your question on fulfillment services, we've got a number of capacity improvements that are coming online this year. So we're excited about the impact those will have not only on the top line and for the customer but also for our sellers. Our sellers are looking for more services and ability to ship and it's a great way to enable small businesses for growth. So as the year goes on, we'll see more and more capacity come online for our fulfillment service business. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. My question is on the U.S. EBIT increase that you saw. I'm wondering, how much of that increase was attributable to what I would assume is a structurally more profitable eCommerce operation given the growth and scale you were able to garner last year? And related to that any updated color regarding the profitability run rate of eCommerce today? John Furner : Good morning Scot, this is John. Specifically on your question on eComm, we feel good about the drivers of the eComm profitability, which is contributed profit rates and that would be gross margins less the cost of shipping. We also feel good about the alternative revenue streams that are included in eCommerce, which are things like the marketplace, fulfillment services. Like I said earlier, we're expanding capacity we know we have seller demand and we're really proud of the triple-digit growth in Walmart Connect. So all of those added together are helpful in the eCommerce P&L. On the breakout, we actually are not breaking out the difference in stores and eComm because it has just become so blurred as we transition to an omni business. We have our merchants that are overseeing all channels by category. Stores are acting as stores, they act as pickup centers and in some cases fulfillment centers. We have fulfillment centers acting as fulfillment centers which go direct to home. And at times they ship to a store so they got -- the inventory can be consolidated with an order and then put into our last mile network. So it's just not possible for us to break those out given how blurred the lines have come. But overall, I'd say the team are doing -- they're just doing a great job with the contributed profit rates and the mix within -- not only the mix within the business like general merchandise versus other things, but within categories they're doing a great job improving contributed profit rates. Scot Ciccarelli : Very helpful. Thanks, Brett. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Grom : Hey, good morning and great quarter here. More of a macro question for me. When you look at the data and see how the consumer is allocated these most recent stimulus checks, I'm curious how they compare and contrast to what you saw in April and late December of this past year. Are they still spending the same amount? Or are we seeing more allocated to savings and therefore there's some pent-up demand that could get spent in the coming months? Brett Biggs : Hey Chuck, this is Brett. Yes, I think we're seeing a little bit of both. I mean you're seeing customers definitely get out and spend again. Spending rates are good. Income rates are good. But savings rates are actually still almost at an all-time high which would lead you to believe that there is going to be some pent-up demand as we get to the back half of the year. So in a lot of ways the consumer balance sheet, unless you're in certain industries that were really impacted by COVID, the consumer balance sheet is about as strong as it's been. Now a lot of that's due to the stimulus the money that's gone into the economy that way. But in either case it would indicate there's some demand coming. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Robby Ohmes : Hey, good morning guys. Doug, you mentioned the omnichannel health and wellness business. Can you remind us what that could ultimately look like? And maybe even what the current like pharmacy recovery, how that's playing out? I know you guys have been involved with vaccines and everything. Anything going on that's going to accelerate the omnichannel health care dream for you guys? Doug McMillon : Yes. Robby I'll jump in first and then John can add. I think the pharmacy business has performed really well considering everything our pharmacists have been doing. It's been an incredible challenge to do everything that they've done since the pandemic started, including all of these vaccinations that they're doing. We did have to shut down our vision centers for a while. Optical though is back open and that's helped a lot. The ultimate destination does look like an omnichannel destination where we'd leverage those historical businesses together with new healthcare services and the digital front-end that John mentioned earlier and I mentioned in my remarks with MeMD. You can imagine a future where we'll be able to reach customers on their devices in their homes to help them think about their healthcare in terms of what they eat how much they move and then what types of health care services they need and where they get them. And so, I think you can see us building together those capabilities that would help people have access to care more of an outcomes-based healthcare system, great value, accessibility and serve a lot of people that need to be served and also end up with a really good business that fits together well with a large food retailer. And so we've just been working through that strategy executing the pieces. And if you look back at the CareZone acquisition, this latest acquisition of MeMD, you can see us adding some capabilities in addition to those that we're building on our own. John Furner : Yeah and I would just add -- go ahead. Robby Ohmes : I was just going to ask is this something that longer term fits in with Walmart+ as well? Doug McMillon : We'll get back to you on that Robby. John Furner : Robby, this is John. I just want to reiterate excitement for the idea of an omni-channel health care solution for customers and Walmart together. Our pharmacists and our pharmacies have performed very well in the last year given all the challenges they've faced. They've opened up curbside delivery, delivery to home. We've got central fill pharmacies now helping assist with cost and efficiency on the service suite that they offer. It's of course different by state, but the way our teams jumped in and found ways to help get the country vaccinated has been nothing short of amazing. I was in a store here locally last night and just seeing a number of people be able to walk up and get their vaccine is very encouraging. And then as Doug said, the market changed last year. We had opened a number of clinics and we continue to open clinics. We're excited about the prospect that clinics bring. And then a large part of health care shifted to digital last year and the entire industry embraced that. So this acquisition of MeMD to enable relationships with customers on their device, in their home and be able to execute service care with our pharmacies and clinics on the backside of that is a really exciting prospect and it's a big part of our flywheel going forward. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the floor back to Doug for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : Just want to close by saying thank you to all of you for following the company so closely. Hopefully, you can see that in addition to the US tailwind that we've got strength building in the company. As I mentioned, I was in a lot of stores during this last quarter and standards are improving, in-stock's improving against the challenges that obviously the pandemic brought. We've also got great momentum and strength in Sam's Club. International had a really good quarter one of the best quarters Brett we've had in a while in International. And the portfolio work that Judith and the team have been doing there is working. And the situation with the virus in India is tragic and we'll support not only our own folks, but the country as much as we can to try and get through that. And I'm sure there will be other hotspot cities and countries that we'll deal with in the coming weeks because this pandemic is not over. But pandemic aside, economic stimulus aside, our focus is on the input metrics, the underlying fundamentals, the capabilities that we're adding. And we see ourselves making real progress against those. The company has changed a lot and there's more change coming. And I'm grateful to the team and excited about the future. Thank you all. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Dan Binder with Investor Relations. Dan, you may begin. Daniel Thomas Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam's Club. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you an update on the business and discuss second quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Results for the second quarter were strong. Excluding divestitures, we saw revenue growth of 7.6% in constant currency, leveraged expenses and grew operating income ahead of sales at 24.1% in constant currency. Recent quarters have demonstrated more than ever that our omnichannel strategy is the right one as we serve customers regardless of how they want to shop. There are occasions when people want to visit a store, times when they want to pick up and times when they want to have it delivered. We're going to keep innovating and executing to get better at all three as our diversified omni model positions us well to gain share in high-growth markets around the world. I want to thank our associates for the work they did to deliver these results. They continue to step up and serve others in an inspiring way. Since the pandemic began, we've been clear that our priority is the safety of our associates and those who shop with us. We think it's important that as many people in the U.S. get vaccinated as soon as possible and vaccines be made widely available around the world. As the Delta variant spread and as the potential for future variants persists, we made the decision to require our U.S. teams, above store and club level, to become fully vaccinated by October 4. At the same time, we doubled the cash incentive to get vaccinated for hourly associates in the U.S. to $150. We're grateful to those associates that are already vaccinated. I'm confident in the fundamental strength of our business even as we navigate the benefits from economic stimulus in the U.S. for both this year and last year. We've proven our ability to serve customers in challenging environments and across multiple channels, formats and countries. The phrase, \"Serving customers\", has traditionally meant one thing at Walmart, but today, it includes serving marketplace sellers, our advertising partners and those that want to use our fulfillment services or proprietary software. Our advertising business in the U.S., Walmart Connect, nearly doubled during the quarter versus last year, with active advertisers up more than 170%. And this isn't confined to the U.S. We're growing ad businesses in Mexico, India, Canada and most recently in Chile. Our fulfillment services for marketplace sellers continues to scale too. We're on-track to hit full year double-digit GMV penetration by year-end. We also announced during the quarter that we'll serve other businesses through certain in-house technologies used for pickup and delivery. Our partnership with Adobe is an example of that. These are a few examples of how we're using our assets to scale new businesses within the company and build new streams of revenue and profit. Our tech and product teams have made a lot of progress modernizing our technology and way of working. We're starting to see the fruit generated by their efforts as we build innovative solutions that have utility across the enterprise. We're starting to see more examples of where one idea or one tech product can benefit more of our businesses and faster. Cloud-powered checkout comes to mind. This technology enables seamless experiences for customers and associates like mobile Check Out With Me, Scan & Go and Self-Checkout. More than 30 applications across five countries are leveraging cloud-powered checkout for retail transactions. Things like building a 360-view of the customer using machine learning is important for our business in the U.S., but it's also important in other markets. That's why we're now leveraging this technology in Mexico and in Central America. The Ask Sam app that you've heard us talk about was originally built for Sam's Club associates. Now the same concept has been adapted for use in supercenters. It helps our associates be more productive and better serve customers. I'm really pleased about the work our tech teams are doing to unlock value across the business. Now let's move on to segment results. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. The underlying business is strong, even as we navigate the many effects of the pandemic as well as government stimulus this year and last year. Customer behaviors changed during the quarter as people were shopping with us more in stores than online. As that shift occurred, we gained market share in grocery. Even as eCommerce growth slowed, as we layered on top of tremendous growth last year, we feel good about our two-year stacks of comp sales and eCommerce growth. The good news for us is that we can serve them either way. And of course, they get to choose. We also saw nearly triple-digit growth in advertising sales through Walmart Connect and added thousands of new sellers on our eCommerce marketplace during the quarter. I like the progress we're making with Walmart Fulfillment Services too. We saw 150 basis points sequential improvement in GMV measured as a percentage of marketplace GMV. Recall, earlier this year, we announced a step-up in capex spending, with heavy emphasis on supply chain in the coming years. This will mean additional capacity and automation from our largest fulfillment centers to our stores. These investments are aimed at increasing assortment to broaden our appeal with customers and get product positioned and picked efficiently to deliver it faster. These investments will increase capacity, help support the growth of Walmart+ and improve productivity. From a merchandising point of view, we launched new private brands in healthcare and pet categories. The new insulin product we're offering is a huge win for customers. We call it ReliOn, and it will save customers up to 75% off the cash price of branded insulin products. Sam's Club in the U.S. continues to impress. 19 years ago, I got the opportunity to become the Chief Merchant at Sam's, and I can confirm there hasn't been a time in at least 19 years when Sam's has had this much momentum. They also have strength in so many key metrics, including our most important membership metrics. We saw that story continue this quarter with membership income growth of 12.2%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Total membership counts are a record high and overall renewal rates, and those for Plus members continue to be strong. Similar to clubs in China and Mexico, members are shopping with us in Club for pickup and delivery. Sam's is an innovation engine for the company, and they're showing us all what's possible with technology products like Scan & Go. For our businesses outside of the U.S., we continue to see strong results in continuing markets through a combination of top line growth and operating discipline. Excluding divestitures, net sales increased nearly 13% in constant currency. eCommerce continues to play a bigger role for us. Net sales penetration for eCommerce was about 19% in Q2, an increase of more than 700 basis points from last year. We're strengthening our omnichannel approach in Mexico, China and Canada. In Mexico, we launched Walmart Pass, a membership model where customers get unlimited same-day delivery from stores, completed the rollout of Scan & Go to all Sam's Clubs, added new sellers to the marketplace and grew our online SKU count by 30%. China had a particularly strong quarter, with growth in eCommerce of 75%. During the 618 festival, eCommerce penetration in this market reached 45%. Our business in Canada also had strong eCommerce growth of 41%. We've seen an uptick in Net Promoter Scores there as more customers are shopping with us across channels. Our eCommerce marketplace in India, Flipkart, continues to drive strong growth in GMV, in line with our high expectations. This team has been busy. They introduced Flipkart Camera, a first-of-its-kind technology at scale for the Indian customer that allows users to view products in their physical environment, expanded their grocery business to over 70 cities and launched a new commerce platform called Shopsy to help reach the reseller community. They're also increasing customer stickiness with Flipkart Plus. It's a tiered program based on spend that helps us drive higher repeat rates. Customers in the program transact more frequently and we see lower churn than others. They also recently completed a new funding round, which placed a value on the business of about $38 billion, significantly higher than the valuation when we invested just three years ago. There were large votes of confidence from a strong group of investors, and we'll put those dollars to work to deliver growth in key areas such as grocery, fashion and our supply chain. You should see the common threads and leverage points across our businesses. Increasingly, we think about global businesses and global tech products rather than thinking or working a country at a time. There's more of a digital-first mindset here. Before I close today, I'd like to remind everyone of the new ESG report we published last month. I encourage you to invest time with each of the briefs to understand our priority issues along with the progress we're making against our commitments. For example, on emissions, we've reduced absolute Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by more than 17% since 2015. Our original target was 18% by 2025. The tremendous progress we've made means we're on-track to achieve the updated target we announced of a 35% reduction by the same date. Additionally, our suppliers report having avoided more than 186 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2020 for a cumulative total of more than 460 million metric tons avoided since we started Project Gigaton in 2017. I also want to take a moment to mention an announcement we made on July 27 regarding the Live Better U education program. Walmart will now pay 100% of college tuition and books for associates as part of our commitment to invest nearly $1 billion over five years in career training and development. This means that roughly 1.5 million full- and part-time associates in the U.S. can earn a college degree or learn other skills without the burden of debt. This is a fantastic initiative, giving our associates the opportunity to learn and grow. I'll close by thanking our associates for how they serve others and our leadership team for their vision and ability to lead so much positive change so quickly. They built us into a global leader in omnichannel retailing with a model that is uniquely Walmart. Our team is designing with the customer at the center of our flywheel, which is coming together nicely. It's exciting to imagine how far we can go. And now over to Mr. Biggs. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug. Our strong second quarter and the solid start to the third quarter position us to deliver a great year of financial results while making steady progress against our strategic priorities. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of the omni strategy, providing customers with new products, services and tools. No matter how customers want to shop, we're here for them. In some periods, in-store shopping will lead the way, and in some, eCommerce will lead the way. While we're always striving for more in each part of the flywheel, I'm pleased with the overall growth of the business. In Walmart U.S., comp sales grew 5.2% and transactions grew more than 6% as customers are returning to the convenience of one-stop, in-store shopping. eCommerce sales grew 6% in Q2 and 103% on a two-year stack. We continue to build a very sizable eCommerce business around the world. In fact, we're on-track to deliver $75 billion in global eCommerce sales this year and on our way to $100 billion in the near term. We're also seeing continued strong U.S. market share gains in grocery, which is a key part of our business. Sam's Club members are increasingly utilizing curbside pickup for online orders and the adoption of Scan & Go technology in club is at an all-time high. The success of Scan & Go at Sam's is one of the reasons we included this as part of the Walmart+ offering. In international, eCommerce penetration is now at nearly 19% of sales, and we're rapidly expanding omni services in key markets such as Mexico. We're also rapidly expanding higher-margin businesses like advertising, data monetization and eCommerce marketplace, which gives us flexibility to invest aggressively for the future while growing profit near term. These businesses are in different places along the maturity curve, but we're scaling them. For example, Walmart Connect U.S. advertising sales nearly doubled in Q2, and we expect the rapid growth to continue. While businesses like our new Fintech JV are still in a start-up phase, we know the opportunities are significant, and we'll share more in the coming quarters. Now let's discuss Q2 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly affect year-over-year comparisons, so my comments today will focus on the underlying business, excluding the effect of divestitures. In addition, the pandemic continues to create both tailwinds and headwinds for the business. U.S. government stimulus benefited sales this year and last year, but many international markets continue to be negatively affected by COVID and related government operating restrictions. COVID costs remained elevated, but significantly lower than last year. Total constant currency revenue growth was strong, up 7.6% to more than $138 billion, with strength across all reporting segments. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased more than 5% in Q2 and more than 14% on a two-year stack basis. International sales growth was strong, up nearly 13% in constant currency, with strength in India, Mexico and China, while Sam's Club comp sales grew more than 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco. Currency benefited sales by about $2.4 billion. Gross margin rate declined 22 basis points, reflecting category mix shift at Sam's Club and format mix shifts in international, but Walmart U.S. gross margin increased with favorable mix and strong Walmart Connect results. SG&A expenses leveraged 78 basis points, reflecting strong sales, lower COVID costs and a 36 basis point benefit from last year's adjusted items, partially offset by increased wage investments in the U.S. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis was up 15.1%, leading to strong adjusted EPS of $1.78 with a $0.03 benefit from currency. As anticipated, free cash flow declined about $8 billion due primarily to inventory increases from improved in-stocks and higher capex. We repurchased $2.4 billion of stock in Q2 and $5.2 billion year-to-date, which is up significantly from last year. This is one of the largest quarters for buybacks over the past two years, demonstrating our financial strength and belief in the value of our company. Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter. Underlying business trends continue to be solid, including strong grocery market share gains, according to Nielsen, and an acceleration of store traffic. In fact, comp sales increased each month through the quarter and we're off to a good start with the back-to-school season. On top of extraordinarily strong growth last year, eCommerce sales were up 6% and have more than doubled over the past two years. Strong sales trends were led by grocery, health and wellness and apparel as well as reopening categories such as automotive, travel and party supplies. Grocery sales were up 6%, including the benefit from modest ticket inflation and increased low double digits on a two-year stack basis. That results in $2.4 billion of growth in food sales year-over-year and about $5.5 billion of growth on a two-year stack. Strong price positioning, great fresh quality and improved in-stocks are driving results. We're excited about the traction we're seeing in strategic growth businesses. Walmart Connect sales roughly doubled in Q2 versus last year as we ramp up new advertisers. The Spark Driver platform continues to grow, supporting last-mile deliveries from stores. Over the past 12 months, we've doubled Spark's coverage to more than 500 cities nationwide, providing access to more than 20 million households. Our eCommerce Marketplace is also expanding, and we expect to make hundreds of thousands of additional items available for fulfillment services this year alone. The Walmart business model is evolving, and these newer businesses are contributing to results in a more meaningful way. Walmart U.S. gross profit rate improved 20 basis points with lower markdowns and strong advertising revenue, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. Margins were also helped by administering COVID vaccines this year and lapping last year's COVID-related closures of Vision and auto care centers. We're continuing to see a bit more cost inflation than normal, but our merchants are working with suppliers and monitoring price gaps to keep prices low while managing margins. Operating income was strong, up about 12% on an adjusted basis. Inventory increased 20% due to lapping COVID-related inventory effects last year and strong sales growth this year. We continue to monitor industry trends related to transit and port delays. Our merchants continue to take steps to mitigate challenges, including adding extra lead time to orders and chartering vessels specifically for Walmart goods. Out-of-stocks in certain general merchandise categories are running above normal, given strong sales and supply constraints. International had a great quarter with strong sales and profit growth. Net sales grew nearly 13% in constant currency, including strength in India, Mexico and China. It's encouraging to see the continued progress of our large and growing eCommerce business in our markets. eCommerce sales grew 86% and penetration accelerated more than 700 basis points to nearly 19% of constant currency sales. Comp sales in Mexico increased 4.7% as the omnichannel strategy continues to accelerate. We're seeing strong response to the launch of Walmart Connect Media in Mexico with the number of advertisers and campaigns growing rapidly. Flipkart had another good quarter. Sales growth was strong even as they dealt with COVID, and we continue to see improving trends in monthly active customers and users. We were excited to take another step to position the Flipkart Group for future growth with the completion of a $3.6 billion funding round in July that included strong representation from external financial investors valuing the business at nearly $38 billion. In Canada, COVID-related government restrictions on the sale of nonessential categories like apparel and general merchandise pressured sales and profitability, but we're optimistic that we'll see a more normalized sales and profit environment in the back half. China comps increased 2.9% and were up 11.6% on a two-year stack, and eCommerce penetration has now reached more than 25% of sales in China. International operating income was strong, increasing about 28%, reflecting sales strength, the benefit from lapping last year's discrete tax item and lower COVID costs. Excluding the discrete item, adjusted operating income increased over 12%. Sam's Club delivered excellent results with strong growth in sales, membership and profit. Comp sales grew 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and were up nearly 28% on a two-year stack basis, including strong eCommerce growth. Membership trends were also strong as we achieved a new high for overall member counts, saw significantly higher renewal rates and delivered record Plus member penetration. Sam's operating income was up 11.5%. Now let's turn to guidance. We're closely monitoring the evolving COVID impacts around the world. Guidance discussed today assumes a continued strong U.S. economy with no new significant government stimulus for the remainder of the year. All of the guidance discussed excludes the impact of international divestitures. We now anticipate higher full year sales growth due to the strong first half performance and an expected good back half of the year, with consolidated net sales growth expected to be up 6% to 7% versus prior guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit increase. Walmart U.S. comp sales are expected to increase 5% to 6%, representing about $20 billion of growth. We anticipate Sam's Club comps to increase 7.5% to 8.5%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and international constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8%. We're also raising full year guidance for operating income and EPS. On a constant currency basis, we expect full year consolidated adjusted operating income to increase 11.5% to 14%, which is a material step-up from our prior guidance of high single-digit growth and an even more significant increase from our initial guidance in February. Walmart U.S. adjusted operating income is expected to increase 11% to 13.5%. Full year adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35. This is an increase from prior guidance of low double-digit growth as well as above the initial guidance of flat to up slightly. The third quarter has started off well as back-to-school shopping is underway and we expect grocery market share gains to continue. We now anticipate Q3 adjusted EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.40, with Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, increasing between 6% and 7%. Again, I'm very pleased with the second quarter results and feel good about the underlying momentum of the business. Thank you for your time and interest this morning, and we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Bob Drbul : Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess the question that I have is you guys talked about inflation running through. I was just wondering if you can maybe give us some categories that you're seeing the most pressure, how you're adjusting with price and, sure, what you're seeing competitively with pricing throughout the business. That would be helpful. Thank you. John Furner : Hey, Bob. Good morning. It's John. Just a couple of things. First, I want to say thanks to my team for the quarter they just completed and the work they've done to position the business so well for now and in the future. Our merchant team, that's as broad as the team at Walmart, fortunately, they have a lot of levers that they can use all across the business to make sure our value is right for customers. We've seen strength in food and general merchandise and other categories. And as the environment changed, the team, they've just done an amazing job reacting to so many things over the last 18 months and continue to do so. And they've been quite deliberate about ensuring that our value remains strong. I'm happy to report that our price value is as strong as it has been throughout the pandemic and above what it was before the pandemic began. And so the team's doing things like driving strong businesses in apparel and home and general merchandise in addition to food, help them mix out. Inventory management is another key to this. We finished the quarter up about 20% in inventory, which I think we're well positioned going into the rest of the year based on where the inventory is. And we've had strong sell-throughs. The comp sales always help. So with the cost pressures that we do see across the supply chain, and you heard Brett mentioned that we're doing things like chartering vessels and securing supply to ensure that we are ready for the third and fourth quarter. And we've seen some inflation in the low single digits. But the thing I watch that I think is just most important is that we see our unit share in categories like food growing faster than our dollar share to ensure that we can position ourselves well in terms of retail value for the customer and play a role in keeping inflation down for the country. Bob Drbul : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I have one for Doug and one for Brett. And Doug mine for you is two parts. First question is if you can give us a sense of the most important strategic imperative that's on your plate. And I was going to throw out a couple, like supply chain, associates and/or alternative profit pools. And I know it may be hard to pinpoint one, but I'm curious where the focus is. And then the second part for you, Doug, is how active of a debate is there about plowing money back into the business because EBIT dollars are growing well above the algo. And I'm curious why not put more back into the business when the business is overdelivering. Doug McMillon : Hey, Simeon. Good morning. As it relates to the most important strategic imperative, the thing that came to mind first was speed. I think innovation and speed may be together. We're trying to change the company. And as we've said to everybody for a while now, our purpose and our values are constant, but everything else is open to change. And we're becoming more digital. We're learning how to work differently. And the reason that I would have that at the top of the list is because that's what bears fruit forever. We've launched new businesses. We've scaled new businesses. A year from now, we're going to be doing the same thing. Five years from now, we're going to be doing the same thing. And so my focus, working with this team and with Suresh and everybody else, is to try and get into how we're working and increase the speed, innovation and productivity of the company. As it relates to putting money back in, I think we've been on our front foot for a while, and we'll stay there. And we're not going to give you any additional guidance today as it relates to capital needs or things like that. But as we shared with you back in February, we've got opportunities to play offense. We're confident in what we're doing. We like the assets we've got. I think some people view stores these days as boring, we don't. We love the business that we've got, and we love what we're adding to it. And if we see opportunities to be more aggressive either on the income statement side or the balance sheet, we'll take them, and we'll share it at that time. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. And I guess a follow-up for Brett, is that thinking about '22 and without giving concrete guidance, you initially set up '21 as this investment year. And now your growth, at least -- sorry, for '22, your fiscal '22 is coming in faster than you expected. So now that that fiscal growth is coming in better than expected, so did it change any algo into next year? Or are you still confident that the business can keep growing algo going forward? Brett Biggs : Yes. Thanks, Simeon. We talked about in February that -- at that time when we gave guidance for this year, we did it assuming there was no government stimulus. We've certainly have gotten some of that during the year, and we've benefited from that. We've been straightforward on that front. So as Doug said though, we've been front-footed. We continue to lean in. We're making investments where we need to make investments. There's nothing that we're pulling back on that we feel is important for the long-term value of the company. And as you look at the longer-term growth that we talked about, 4% type growth for the company longer term, I still feel good about that. I feel good about our ability to grow profit greater than sales as we talked to in February. None of that has changed. And we -- but we said it's the first year or two, year-to-year growth depends some on what we see on stimulus this year, which we've gotten quite a bit. So year-to-year, Simeon, we'll come out and talk about that. But longer term, I remain very, very optimistic about the company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. Actually, just I guess following up on that. So I think the NOC, that Walmart would get is obviously that you've been in a perpetual kind of investment cycle. And it does seem that you're in a little bit more of a steady state. So wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on that with respect to the longer-term outlook of where you think you're at on capex and wages beyond fiscal '22. Because again, I think it does seem that the algorithm seems a little bit more sustainable in this -- with the sales versus -- U.S. sales versus U.S. EBIT relationship. Doug McMillon : Karen, this is Doug. I'll go first, and then Brett can chime in if he wants to. The business, it's interesting to think about it in terms of investment cycles. The business is always going to make investments and it's going to grow and it's going to grow earnings. And why can't we do those things at the same time? Why can't we invest capital in automation, for example, and increase productivity and have earnings growth to the degree that we should? We manage the short term and the long term. As everybody knows, we're a company that's particularly focused on the long term, particularly focused on the top line, we'll manage the bottom line. But I kind of would like to push back a little bit on this -- are you in investment cycle today? Will you be tomorrow? We'll be announcing investments all the time and you guys should expect us to grow the top line and the returns of the company over time as we do that. The business is changing shape. And I think that's the key. We're not just buying and selling merchandise in supercenters at this point. We're changing how the company is comprised. If you look at -- just imagine a bar charter revenue or a bar charter profitability, the mix is shifting. And that unlock, as we stick with it, creates a different financial equation than what we would have had years ago. Brett Biggs : Yes. I was thinking about, Karen, so five years ago, almost six years ago now when we talked about that we needed to take the opportunity to invest in wages and eCommerce. And we were a little bit behind where we wanted to be in some areas. And now when we invest, it feels very offensive, feels like we're improving our competitive position. It's very broad-based. When you look at the results this quarter, as an example, of Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club and International, very broad-based, strong performance. And to Doug's point, I think we'll continue to be able to do both, grow top line returns, grow bottom line, while we continue to invest in the business. I think all of those are a critical piece of what we're doing. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just one follow-up on one of the previous questions. Just Brett, you mentioned stimulus impact. I don't know if you can maybe build on that a little bit more. I mean, we obviously know that there's been a lot out there, but I don't know if you're able to frame that at all. And then my other question, just more around supply chain management. Inventory levels looking good and stock's better. How do you feel about kind of as we look forward to the second half holidays? Obviously, the comp guide is good, but just access to product for whether it be Halloween, Christmas, that timing of events you're planning. Just how are you thinking about that as we pick more toward the fourth quarter? Thanks. Brett Biggs : Yes. Peter, it's Brett. I'll start out. I mean, we did -- we gave guidance in February that didn't include stimulus. At the time, we didn't know what's going to happen, so it was an easier way to give guidance. We've gotten stimulus. Given what's happened in the last 18 months, it gets pretty challenging to try to pick apart what things benefited what part of the business. We know we've benefited from stimulus. But the underlying business is really strong. John will talk about it in a minute, but what you see in our food business, which sometimes gets overlooked despite the size and the importance of that to our company. Back-to-school is really strong. So I feel good about the underlying business that I see regardless of whether there's stimulus or not. John Furner : Good morning, Peter. This is John. I'll just pick up where Brett left off. As Brett mentioned in the opening comments, the comps improved sequentially each month of the quarter. And we feel great about that momentum. Our team has worked really hard this year to position the business well going into this what seems to be a strong back-to-school season early. We're happy with the results in categories like apparel and stationery and others that you would expect in a strong time like this. I mean, as far as the supply chain, the team, really, really proud of the work the team has done and thankful that we have such an experienced team who can manage these types of disruptions that we've seen around the global supply chain. So we've chartered vessels, as Brett said. We've secured capacity for the third and fourth quarter and feel good about the inventory positioning or particularly compared to last year with inventory up 20% across the segment. So I think we're in good shape going into the fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter. Of course, we'll manage this the entire time and look for strong results as we get into the third quarter. Doug McMillon : Good to hear from Kath and maybe, Judith, if you want to on supply chain challenges around the world. Sam faces the same set of issues, whether it's the tailwinds from stimulus or what's happening with supply chain. And you've got some seasonal categories where you can read sales earlier than we would in Walmart U.S. Kathryn McLay : Yes, certainly. We saw strong seasonal sales through Q1, particularly in our GM areas. And that was certainly assisted by stimulus. But what we're seeing in Q2 is that same strength continuing. So whether we're seeing it in back-to-school and Halloween or fall, we're seeing our members highly participating in those categories. And we thought we bought aggressively. We wished we bought even more aggressively, I think there's a lot of upside in that space. Judith McKenna : In International, it's very similar trends in some of our markets that John outlined. One of the unique capabilities that Walmart has is its scale and its ability to leverage across that scale. So we have -- we've worked with the U.S. businesses, for the Canada business, particularly under our Mexico business, to try to make sure that we keep in-stock for the customer front of mind. We're continuing to see strength in all of the categories that we've got, but we're prioritizing the holiday season coming up. And then in India, we're prioritizing Big Billion Day, which is the Diwali Festival, which is coming up in early November. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Steph Wissink : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. We'd like to focus on omni and e-comm, if we could. I think, Doug, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the business is becoming more global in orientation versus regional. And I think you also said or stated some really strong penetration levels for e-comm in some of your International markets in places like China on 618 and other events. I'm just wondering if you can talk about your $100 billion e-comm channel goal through that lens of International. How do you think about the International markets influencing maybe the domestic market or vice versa in terms of your investment strategy? Thank you. Doug McMillon : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll get Judith to chime in here, too. It's exciting to see what's happened. And it hasn't been forced by us, but the world changed as it became more digital and the business models and the products we need to build, the work we need to do ends up being even more common than it was before it feels like. And so with the shift in the International portfolio that Judith has led, we find ourselves positioned, with the Flipkart investment in particular, toward more of a digital business and more of an e-comm business. I started learning about e-comm from food from the U.K. many years ago. Then we all saw China explode. Now we're living in a very different environment in India versus what we see in the U.S. And Walmex, Judith, has become more of a digital company and looks more like the U.S. in some ways. And so it's exciting to see a pure eCommerce percentage for International and for the total company grow. I think the story that gets buried there is that the business overall is becoming more digital in its mindset. Judith McKenna : We've definitely seen a transformation in the way the businesses are thinking. India is slightly different because Flipkart, of course, and PhonePe, our payments business there have always been digital-first. And we've learned an awful lot from them. And I'm so encouraged by what I'm seeing out of India. You've got to remember, this is a market where digital penetration was really quite low when we made our original investment. And that has just continued to increase. And I think the circumstances of the pandemic have helped to reinforce that as well. And we were really pleased to see the $38 billion fund raise for India that we did recently. And the quality of the investors that we've got there, I think, is testament to the way that that business has a future growth trajectory as well. But all around the world, where we've seen the real step-up is in omnichannel, very similar again to U.S. trends. Canada, you saw that we reported a 41% growth for the quarter, that business continues to build. But really, Mexico Walmex is the one that's building out an ecosystem and it had been through a digital transformation for the entire business to work in a much more agile way and looking at the way that they're connecting the customer with a digital offering. So while you have got the pure online business, which is Marketplace, you've got the omnichannel business, they're also expanding into areas such as telephone and Internet, provision of services for customers, which is absolutely critical because so many people in Mexico don't have access to Internet services. So this is a way of bringing people in to the top of the funnel. So yes, really pleased to see the level of online penetration in the scale of the business that we're building in International. Doug McMillon : The only other thing that came to mind was the difference between input metrics and output metrics. The $75 billion number on its way to $100 billion is an output metric. We're focused on how do you do a better job with all the inputs related to omni. And that's hard work. And building digital products that marry eCommerce with stores takes more work than just building an eCommerce solution, takes more time, takes more complexity, but that's where the secret sauce is. And if we can continue to blur the lines so that customers and members can shop however they want to shop, whenever they want to shop, the output metrics that we sometimes measure of e-comm versus store growth, for example, they'll be what they are. But this quarter is kind of a good example of the fact that we can be somewhat indifferent. We're trying to build a model where we're completely in different top and bottom line as it relates to how people shop. And so I think we started that and still have a lot to do to deliver on that goal. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward Kelly : Hi, guys. Good morning. Two-part question. Gross margin in the U.S., could you just talk about your expectation as we think about the back half of the year. You're up on a two-year stack basis, about 30 basis points in Q1, that accelerated in Q2. Is that difference really vaccine? And then over the next couple of quarters, how are you thinking about that dynamic given that it does seem like some of the inflationary pressures and product costs probably accelerate? And then the second thing I just want to ask about is Sam's Club. Grocery really seemed to accelerate sequentially unless I did the numbers wrong here. Can you just provide us a little bit more color in terms of what you saw there? Thank you. John Furner : Hey, Edward. It's John. Let me take the first question and then hand it over to Kath to talk about the momentum at Sam's. But as far as the margin rates that we reported in previous quarters, the way we're thinking about this is it's all about positioning value with our customers and then the mix of what we're selling. And let me talk about value for a second first. We're really proud of the price gaps that we're seeing at this time, which are at pre-pandemic levels and beyond. As I said earlier, it's really positive to see that the unit growth in big categories like our food department are higher than the share gains that we see in dollars. So relative value is something we think about a lot. As far as then the results that you've seen, it's a function of mix and then a strong performance by our U.S. supply chains. The teams have just done a number of things to ensure that flow is strong, and that would include everything from offshore to onshore properties like our distribution network. And in particular, our food distribution team has done an amazing job keeping products moving. And then ending the quarter, I feel really good about our inventory position. Starting with this very strong back-to-school season that we're seeing, which would include our apparel business, our stationery business and other businesses like lunch boxes and backpacks and all the things that you'd expect for kids to return to school have been off to a good start. And then the mix of inventory going into the quarter, we're up about 20% from where we were a year ago. And I think that's a result -- the result of that has been the stronger comps that we're seeing each month of the quarter as the quarter progressed. But I'll turn it over to Kath to talk about the really strong momentum at Sam's. Kathryn McLay : Yes. So thanks for the question. I think we're proud of the comp of 10.6 this quarter, most proud also of the two-year stack of 27.8. Strength is coming through grocery, you're right, we're seeing that grow in the mid-teens. But I'd also call your attention to the GM side of it as well, too, because we were really proud to see the home and apparel business growing at the rate it's grown over the last few quarters as well. So some real strength coming through across the box. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Securities Please proceed with your question. Robbie Ohmes : Hi. Good morning. I had just a follow-up actually on the U.S. eCommerce business. It decelerated to, I guess, 6% against really tough comparisons. But maybe can we get some more color on sort of the -- how pickup versus delivery and Spark and maybe versus ship-to-home kind of played out? And what the expectations might be for -- built in for eCommerce for the back half and how we should think about it. And then maybe also to that is if there is this shift moving back to in-store, can you remind us if that's supporting or will be supporting gross margins for the U.S. business in the back half as well. John Furner : Yes. Looking at the business, first thing that I would just remind everyone that we've been talking about for a while, that we're positioning this business to serve the customer however the customer wishes to be served, and that would include pickup, delivery to home and shopping in store. And so late in the first quarter, we definitely saw a traffic shift back into store from eCommerce and pickup. And that continued early in the quarter. And just as a reminder, as you said, we were up against strong comparisons particularly early in the quarter. And so that resulted in the total business running about 103% for the two-year stack. So we doubled the business over the last few years, and we feel great about that. We also feel great about the capacity that we've put down last year. Our pickup business was quite strained early in the pandemic as well as inventory availability. And over the last 18 months, the team have done a great job building more capacity into pickup and also finding new ways that they can ship customers. So when a customer orders from walmart.com, at times, we fill from fulfillment centers, other times it's from stores and sometimes it's a combination of the two, wherever the inventory is. And we try to keep the customer promise in mind ensure that we're fulfilling in the best way possible. So the mix of the business definitely shifted in the quarter. I think what we're seeing early in the third quarter, as I said, again, a strong back-to-school season, which would include apparel and brands that we've launched online. We've launched about 1,000 brands in the last year on online and feel very great about the potential those have. So we'll be positioned and ready, depending on where the customer shifts. Certainly, we're monitoring changes geographically around the country as it relates to the pandemic and the Delta variant, which are some of the things that caused the changes that happened last year in the first and second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious with regards to Walmart Connect, just with regards to the advertisers you're signing up, is it really across the board in terms of your vendor base? Or is it mostly in grocery? And is there a way to quantify how much this contributed to the margin? John Furner : Well, let me talk about just general mix and business. Doug mentioned earlier that we're focused on changing the way of working all across the business. Really proud of the work that our product team and our tech teams have done in the last few quarters to ensure that we are ready for the customer however they wish to be served. And over time, what we've seen and what we'll continue to see is a really positive change in mix to the overall structure of the way we think about the business, our input metrics, our output metrics and our P&L. And those mix improvements are coming from things like advertising, our Marketplace, fulfillment services. Rental incomes are stronger in the physical environment, our membership income. And then as we said earlier, doing things like having software licenses and using Software-as-a-Service to others. So all of those are strong. And we did say that advertising just about doubled for the quarter, we're up 95%. And our active advertisers was up even more than that. So there is strength among the advertisers across the board and an expansion of our marketplace and fulfillment services will only enable future growth of the advertising business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig deeper into the drivers of the grocery acceleration you saw during the quarter. I was curious if you can comment more on some of the internal factors supporting that acceleration. And then also some of the external factors, whether it's travel tax credit or COVID cases spiking. Thank you. John Furner : Yes. Grocery was strong throughout the quarter. And as Brett mentioned earlier, certainly, there have been some benefits of stimulus and other programs that would have helped. I think -- what I think is most encouraging that I'm seeing inside the business is the capacity and abilities that have been built in the quarter by the supply chain network here at Walmart, along with our supply base and our suppliers. I'd like to say thank you to them as well because without them we wouldn't be able to do the things that we're doing in food right now. But the business, they're running record volumes through our supply chain network each and every week. We've seen extremely high volumes in stores. We've seen growth with our pickup business and with our e-com business in food. So all across the board, we're just excited about some of the progress and some of the product improvements that we've seen in categories like produce and meat. And the momentum is very helpful. So the share numbers are also positive. And I've said this probably three times, but it's important, and I'll just say it again, we are very encouraged that units are growing faster than dollar share in grocery. Doug McMillon : There's a lot of tonnage going through. And I'd just underline fresh. John mentioned produce and meat. The team, back before the pandemic started, had a rollout of something we call Produce 2.0, which improved the presentation of fresh produce but also capacity. So it was really well timed given what happened during the pandemic. And as I go into stores, produce is standing tall and has throughout, from an in-stock point of view, it's been one of the bright spots in terms of us being able to get product and display it well. And then Sam's Fresh performance has been really strong too. It's one thing to stay in stock on corn flakes, it's another on merchandise fresh and the teams have done a nice job during this period. Kathryn McLay : Yes. And I think we've started remodeling half of our fleet in what we call bold and blue, and it really makes the merchandise stand tall. And so I think taking away some of the clutter in the clubs and making the merchandise the hero has enabled our fresh sales to kind of continue to grow as well. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On this subject of market share, it's done a sharp reversal from the last year. How much would you attribute to your initiatives, whether it's fresh presentation, pricing impact versus just the macro where the consumer might have got extra money from the child tax credit or stimulus check went to the store to buy general merchandise and while he or she was there stocked up on groceries. My follow-up is on Walmart Connect. Really good advertising businesses in the eCommerce space, represents 5% to 10% of GMV. Is it fair to think that you're still in the nascent stages, maybe 1% to 2%? And where can your penetration go? And are you seeing that it's incremental to your relationship with your vendors? Or is it coming at the expense of other forms of payment that might be making to you? Thank you. John Furner : Hey. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. Let me talk about food first. I think everything you said would be on the list of things that are helping, and that would be better pricing, better availability in stores, quality of product, supply chain again, my hats off to them for all the work that they've done in the last 18 months, but in particular, the last quarter, they have just performed very well. Also just a reminder that last year, we had shorter operating hours in stores across the country, in many cases. Some of our entrances and exits had been closed. Some of our peripheral services like optical and the auto care centers were closed to free up staffing to run the core pieces of the business. So I think in general, the entire business is positioned better than it was a year ago. Certainly, we'll react geographically and ensure that associate safety and customer safety are prioritized throughout this wave of the pandemic, but our team is well equipped to make the best decisions to be able to do that. As far as the Connect business, it's growing. We certainly would say that we're in a good position for growth now, but continued growth in the future, being able to double in the most recent quarter is exciting. And then the strength of the eCommerce business, including the Marketplace, is what enables that growth over the long term. We rebranded the business from Walmart Media Group to Walmart Connect last year, and that was just to make sure that it was very clear that this opportunity is going to help us connect buyers, sellers, suppliers and customers altogether in a way that's accretive to the customer experience. And as long as we do that, I will remain very, very bullish on the growth potential in this business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen : Hi. Thank you very much. Doug, as you think about Walmart as an ecosystem, what's ahead for healthcare? You've had a lot of innovation with the ReliOn products as well as urgent care centers. Would love your thoughts on relevance to the customer in the context of that in the pharmacy as well as Walmart+ and what stage you are in there as you test, read and react and refine that membership program. We'd also love your view, John, on micro fulfillment centers and what's ahead for the degree of automation that you'll see in the future and the capabilities that you want to build as you continue to innovate in curbside and delivery. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Oliver, the way that things get stitched together is important and being a large seller of food is helpful as it relates to the role that, that data and the relationship we can ultimately build with the customer relate to healthcare. And so it's exciting in the U.S., and I hope ultimately around the world to play a role in healthcare that helps people get high-quality care at a really good value in an accessible way, enabling them to take more control over their own health and their situation. And John will comment more on this in just a second, but the work we did to build some clinics has been helpful, and I think we'll have more clinics in the future. But the clinics aren't the thing on its own. It's how we stitch this whole thing together from telehealth in the role that healthcare plays in the home, on mobile devices, how you triage a customer when they start to interact with you to direct them to the place to get the right care at the right time. And sometimes that will include a trip to the store in the clinic. Sometimes it will be a telehealth experience that they have in their home or somewhere else. And so we're putting building blocks in place. It feels, John, like we've got a lot of ingredients on the table, including the addition of Dr. Cheryl Pegus, who's now leading that business. The strategy is increasingly clear to us. The pieces are on the table. We're going to need some time to execute it because healthcare is so local. And we've learned a lot about that in the last couple of years with these clinics. And so I continue to be really excited about the role we can play and I'm pleased with the steps we're taking forward. John Furner : I feel exactly the same way. I think the combination of a digital relationship in addition to being local between Walmart and Sam's and our pharmacy network in over 5,000 communities is a big piece of the answer. And that could include having your entire session online, it could include what you buy in terms of your food and how you consume, it could include going to clinic. It also includes the pharmacists that we have across the network who have just done such an amazing job this year helping the country with vaccinations. And it's great to see them practicing at the top end of their license and they've made such a difference. So I'm really excited about what's coming in healthcare. I think we can make a big difference for our customers. Doug McMillon : Walmart+ can play a role in how food and healthcare come together. There's just so much opportunity. You can imagine what happens with data there, with all the appropriate privacy and protections in place. I think the future of Walmart+ just is kind of like this continuous burn for us where we add things to it, it becomes even more unique to Walmart. Of course, delivery is a big part of it, but there will be other components, too. John Furner : That's right. That's right. And so much of health is really determined by social determinants of health, which a large part of that is what you consume. And being able to have access at your home to fresh foods as part of the program is really important. Oliver, your second question on market fulfillment centers, another area that I'm really excited about. And the big headline, I think, that is important is that we are learning very quickly how to use our supply chain assets, including local assets, upstream assets, distribution assets very dynamically to be able to move product and assemble orders in a way that is most efficient to meet the customer promise. And so these market fulfillment centers will help us not only with local capacity but they'll help us keep orders consolidated all the way to the point that they move into our last mile network, which is the Spark Network that we mentioned earlier. And the team led by Tom Ward are just doing a fantastic job building capacity capability. Just the other day, I ordered something on walmart.com at 10 in the morning. At 11 :45, it was sitting on the front porch and have been delivered. So stories and the ways that they're learning to delight customers ahead of expectations is really unique, and it is an advantage of having so many locations locally around the country and the ability to scale this, I'm excited about. The automation is going to help. And next time that we're able to host you here, we should be able to show you a facility here locally that will be quite interesting. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : I want to thank you again for your interest in the company. And I want to thank this leadership team, and of course, our associates. This team is building for the mid to long term, and they're doing a great job of managing and performing in the short term, navigating a pandemic, keeping the stores in stock, serving customers and members while we change the business to be more digital, as I mentioned earlier, to get faster, more innovative, more productive as we build it. And it's actually a lot of fun. It's challenging. This continues to be a challenging year, and our folks on the frontline are doing a great job, but I just want to express my gratitude. Thank you all. Operator : [Operator Closing Remarks]",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Dan Binder, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Dan, you may now begin. Dan Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to Walmart's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart US; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam's Club. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide an update on the business and discuss third quarter results. That will be followed by our question and answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We continue to have momentum. Sales were strong throughout the third quarter and we've seen a good start to the fourth quarter thanks to all the thoughtful planning and hard work from our associates. In addition to visiting stores and Sam's Clubs in the US this quarter, I also got to visit stores with the Canadian leadership team in the Toronto market. It was a reminder that our associates around the world have served others throughout this pandemic with courage and resilience. Our Canadian stores had some great items for Diwali, we sold through Halloween well. In the seasonal areas, we're ready for Christmas. In the US, we're ready for the holidays too. There is a level of excitement in the year. You can feel it. I've been walking away from these stores with the recurring thought. We're ready. We have the people, the products and the prices to deliver a great holiday season. Around the world so many families depend on us for food, apparel, home items, TVs and seasonal items like toys and Christmas trees. They trust us to have what they're looking for and at the right price. And while this year has its challenges, we're in position to serve them. All segments saw strong top line gains in the quarter, excluding divestitures, and I could not be prouder of our team. They continue to solve problems and move with speed. Walmart US drove a sequential acceleration in comp sales both on a one and two-year basis, and continued to gain market share in grocery. Sam's Club had another very strong quarter, as did Walmart International, with China, Mexico and India leading the way. Customers and members are shopping with us across channels, and we're making it easier for them. Speed matters. That's why we offer fast same-day delivery to millions of customers around the world. Walmart has served customers across economic cycles for more than 50 years. Each one is unique and they require us to adapt. In this latest cycle, the pandemic caused shifts in how customers and members shopped and what they purchased. The long period of sustained demand for goods has stretched supply chains, resulting in out-of-stocks and inflation. Fighting inflation is in our DNA. Sam Walton loves that fight and so do we. I want to thank our truck drivers, merchants, replenishment teams, our associates that move inventory through the supply chain and our suppliers. They're working together creatively and quickly. We have lots of variables to manage to deliver everyday low prices to customers and simultaneously strong financial results for our shareholders. We continue to make progress on our strategy. The team is moving fast and being aggressive as we build the pieces of our flywheel. In the US, Walmart Go Local for last mile delivery is an example. We're excited to have the Home Depot join Walmart and Sam's Club to share our white label delivery as a service platform. This service is powered by our proprietary driver platform, Spark Driver. The technology behind it is now available in Mexico as we learn to build more digital products that can be leveraged globally. Spark continues to grow and is now active in 900 US cities, providing access to more than 50% of US households. And we're just getting started. We recently enabled a new feature within the Spark Driver app called shopping and delivery, which gives service providers the option to shop and deliver customers' orders. So, if delivery slots are full at a location, this feature allows us to serve that demand. The Spark platform has a lot of potential in the US and beyond. Selling advertising is another important piece of the flywheel because it helps suppliers and marketplace providers sell more, while creating a new profit opportunity for us. Globally, we continue to see rapid growth in advertising income led by the US, Flipkart and Mexico. We're also making good progress at PhonePe, and we're starting to ramp in Canada and Chile. Beyond advertising income, we're creating new ways to gather and analyze data to fuel smarter, faster decision-making to better serve customers, members and suppliers. Earlier this quarter, we launched Walmart Luminate in the US, which is a new suite of data products created for our merchants and suppliers to reveal actionable category and item inside. Our sales team is getting started, and we're encouraged by the number of suppliers that have already signed up and their feedback. Our work to become a regenerative company continues. We had an offsite recently with over 50 of our leaders from several countries to imagine what more we can do and how we can pick up speed. Environmental, social and governance issues are important to us, and we're committed to continuing our leadership. In September, we issued our first ever green bond at $2 billion. It is one of the largest yet from a US-based company. Proceeds are to be used to fund projects like renewable energy, high performance buildings and zero waste. While we've been investing in environmental sustainability projects for years, the size and design of this bond is aligned with the bold commitments we've more recently made. We hosted our Sustainability Milestone Meeting in October. Many of our suppliers, NGO partners and associates attended. We shared a new goal at the meeting to achieve a 15% absolute reduction of our virgin plastic footprint by 2025. We think this goal and others announced at the meeting will move our business in a direction that is good for the planet and good for business by giving our customers the things they love without things they don't. Now let's move on to segment results. I'll begin with Walmart US. Comp sales of 9.2% or 15.6% on a two-year stack is remarkable growth. The gains we've seen in market share for grocery and strong back to school results indicate our inventory position has improved. Prices and assortment are compelling, and customers continue to move away from early pandemic behaviors. We see tailwinds in our results. A strong consumer, a degree of inflation and government stimulus are all factors. But I also like what I see in the core of the business. Transaction counts in our stores and clubs are growing; inventory is up 11.5%; our price gaps or where we want them; and we're innovating in the supply chain and adding capacity. And we're building businesses like Walmart Go Local, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart Plus, Spark delivery, our Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. Financial services is another area where we know we can make a difference in the lives of so many. We recently launched bill payment services in our stores as well as the ability to load money to a bank account or a prepaid card. Moving to Sam's Club US. Comp sales were strong at 13.9%, excluding fuel. Membership is the lifeblood of the club model. Growth in membership income of 11.3% is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Membership count reached a new record high during the quarter. And overall renewal rates were strong across the board, including first-year renewals and those for Plus members. Both individual and business members are shopping with us across channels and using the digital tools we've developed. The new Don't Forget function with Scan and Go is a great example. It's a completely digital way for us to help members and drive basket size at the same time. Based on a member's shopping history, we can target items that a member may be forgetting in their trip all through the app, and we already see an increase in the number of items in the basket. We're also expanding delivery options at Sam's. We now offer same-day delivery for 440 clubs using our Spark Driver network. Turning to Walmart International. We had another quarter of strong growth, with sales up 10.3% and profit up even higher at 17.5%, excluding divestitures and currency. We ended the quarter in great shape on inventory and price gaps. Back to school and other fall celebrations helps drive traffic for us as families began to get back to normal shopping patterns. The festive season is off to a strong start with Big Billion Days in India. We continue to see strong growth in e-commerce. On a two-year stack, sales increased 91%, led by Flipkart and China. We've talked about the importance of omnichannel globally, and we continue to see the buildout of these models across markets. Our small Sam's Club depots that extend the reach of our large clubs in China helped deliver e-commerce growth of 96%, with incredibly fast delivery for everyday items. In Mexico, we continue to expand same-day delivery and express delivery orders quickly reach customers using crowdsourcing capabilities. And in both Mexico and Canada, the expansion of omni capabilities is driven by technology that we've developed to share across markets, further leveraging our scale. Our international markets are building flywheels that have common characteristics with each other and with the US which helps us innovate and leverage the technology we're building. Our store and club formats are well positioned. We're moving quickly to add and expand more digital businesses, including e-commerce and payments, to create new business models. We're innovating for our customers like the recent expansion of Flipkart SuperCoins across platforms. We're also making important investments for the future while delivering profitable growth today. You see examples of these investments in our supply chain in India and Mexico, new clubs in China and store remodels in Canada. The team is delivering on its purpose of driving long-term sustainable growth for the Company. With that, I'll close today by thanking our associates around the world for what they do each day to serve our customers and drive results. The holiday season is here and we're ready. Our teams have been working hard to ensure we have the people, the products and the prices that will help make this season special for everyone. I'll now hand it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug. In the third quarter, momentum continued with strong sales and profit growth in each of our segments while continuing to accelerate our strategic priorities. We're off to a good start for the holiday season and in good position to continue delivering strong results. Despite the various macro and industry challenges, our inventory position is good. Stores and fulfillment centers are well-staffed and our price position remains strong. Customers should expect to find the items they want at great values, and we are ready to serve them however they want to shop. Our omni model is a substantial competitive advantage as shopping behaviors continue to evolve. Customers want choices in how they shop and our unique set of assets with a network of stores, expanding digital capabilities, robust distribution networks and innovative services very effectively serve their evolving needs. Walmart US comp sales grew 9.2%, including nearly 6% growth in transactions, with in-store shopping leading the way. E-commerce sales growth was up 8% in Q3 against strong sales gains last year, resulting in an 87% two-year stack. We continue to see strong market share gains in grocery this year as well as unit share gains on a two-year stack. Sam's Club had another outstanding quarter with comp sales growth, excluding fuel, of 15.5%, including more than 10% growth in transactions and 32% growth in e-commerce. Membership counts had another record high and renewal rates remained strong. International results were impressive, including e-commerce penetration of around 19% as omni services scale across key markets. For example, Canada has expanded online grocery pick up from stores nationwide, while in Mexico, customers' express delivery orders can be shipped via gig drivers in under 90 minutes from 120 stores. We continue to make good progress on accelerating the flywheel. We're seeing increased contributions from growth businesses such as advertising, e-commerce marketplace and Spark last mile delivery. Our delivery reach is expanding and our scale enables us to monetize this capability by offering same day services to other merchants through our Walmart Go Local's B2B initiative. Now let's discuss Q3 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments today will focus on the underlying business, excluding the effect of divestitures. Also COVID costs remained elevated globally, although lower than last year in most markets. In addition, EPS includes a $0.67 negative effect from premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. Total constant currency revenue grew more than 10% to over $139 billion. Walmart US comp sales momentum remained strong; up 15.6% on a two-year stack, due in part to strong US consumer spending and some inflation. Strength in China, Mexico and India led to international sales growth of more than 10% in constant currency. Strong trends at Sam's Club continued with comp growth of nearly 31% on a two-year stack, excluding fuel and tobacco. Currency benefited sales by about $1.3 billion. Gross margin rate declined 51 basis points due primarily to increased supply chain costs and headwinds from fuel mix in the US segments as well as format mix shifts in International. However, total gross margin dollars grew 9.6%. SG&A expenses leveraged 13 basis points, reflecting strong sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by increased wage investments in the US. As a result of these investments, we've seen a great response to our holiday hiring programs, with the addition of over 200,000 new store and supply chain associates. Operating income on a constant currency basis was up 6.3%, leading to adjusted EPS of $1.45. As anticipated, free cash flow for the year is about $8 billion lower than last year, primarily reflecting inventory increases and higher capex. We repurchased $2.2 billion of stock in Q3 and $7.4 billion year-to-date, up significantly from last year. I'm pleased with the improvements in ROI, even as we've made strategic investments, with reported ROI increasing 80 basis points to 14.5%, which is among the best level in four years. Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart US had another good quarter, aided by strong consumer spending, stemming in part from government stimulus and inflation. Strong sales trends were led by grocery, health and wellness and apparel. Back to school categories also performed well, along with automotive and holiday decor. We're pleased with the strong momentum in the grocery business as our strong price positioning and omni offerings resonate with customers. Grocery sales were up nearly 10% as strong unit growth and low to mid single digit inflation benefited results. In fact, food sales grew $3.6 billion during Q3, which is the strongest quarterly growth in six quarters. We're continuing to enhance and scale our strategic growth businesses. Both national and local partners have shown strong interest in our new Walmart Go Local business, while the Spark Driver platform continues to expand nationally. Walmart Connect advertising sales have increased nearly 240% on a two-year stack, and in Q3, we launched a new demand side platform in partnership with the Trade Desk to expand offsite media offerings. We also added around 21 items to our e-commerce marketplace assortment during the quarter, significantly increased the number of items available for expedited delivery and saw continued strong growth in Walmart Fulfillment Services' penetration. Walmart US gross profit rate declined 12 basis points, reflecting increased supply chain costs. We're seeing inflationary cost pressures in some areas, and our merchants remain laser focused on taking the necessary steps to mitigate supply chain congestion while working with suppliers in monitoring price gaps to manage margins appropriately. Lower markdowns and increased contributions from advertising revenue have helped offset cost pressures. SG&A expenses deleveraged 20 basis points due primarily to investments and wages. But operating income was strong, up almost 6%. Inventory increased 11.5% in preparation for what we expect to be a strong holiday season. The steps taken to mitigate transit and port delays have positioned us well, including adding extra lead time to orders, chartering vessels for Walmart goods, rerouting deliveries to less congested ports and expanding overnight hours at key US ports. International had a great quarter, with double-digit sales growth, strong momentum in e-commerce across key markets and operating profit growth outpacing sales. E-commerce sales in constant currency grew 33% on top of strong gains last year, with growth in China, Flipkart and Mexico particularly strong. We've nearly doubled e-commerce sales in international over the past two years, and it's encouraging that our ecosystem is expanding and developing in areas such as digital advertising. China comps were quite strong in Q3, increasing 16.5% with continued strength from Sam's Club as well as more than 90% growth in e-commerce sales. During the mid-autumn festival, sales were terrific and we saw an acceleration in omni performance with nearly all hypermarkets setting online sales records during this event. Flipkart had another good quarter, with strong sales growth and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. In anticipation of the holiday season, the team has doubled fulfillment capacity versus last year, with dozens of new fulfillment center locations, more than 1,000 last mile delivery hubs, and expanded relationships with Toronto partners to handle a large percentage of last mile deliveries. Comp sales in Mexico increased 6% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD, with strong consumer spending on categories related to back to school and seasonal celebrations. Customer adoption of omni offerings continue to grow, and we're seeing a strong response to the launch of Walmart Fulfillment Services with one-fourth of Marketplace sales fulfilled through this network. In Canada, comp sales were up 6% and increased more than 13% on a two-year stack. Seasonal sales events were especially strong and omni sales continued to increase. Online grocery is now available in nearly all stores, and we've launched Express pickup within two hours in a couple of stores in Toronto. International operating income at constant currency increased 17.5%, reflecting strong sales and expense leverage. Sam's Club continued to deliver excellent results, with strong growth in sales, membership and profit. Membership income was up more than 11% as we achieved another record in member counts, strong renewal rates and increased Plus member penetration. Sam's operating income was up more than 10% as strong membership income and expense leverage more than offset gross margin pressure from supply chain costs, fuel and inflation. Now let's turn to guidance. We anticipate Q4 Walmart US comp sales, excluding fuel, increasing around 5%, resulting in over 6% gain for the full year. Annual adjusted EPS is expected to be around $6.40 for the year, representing 17% growth. We continue to make good progress on our capital investments, but we now anticipate the timing of some investments originally planned for this year will flow into next year. As a result, we expect full year capex to be around $13 billion versus our original guidance of $14 billion. In closing, I'm very encouraged by the Q3 results, and I'm optimistic about Q4. I continue to be very excited about the evolution of Walmart into a one of a kind omnichannel company. Thank you for your interest this morning. And we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Mr. Lasser, please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. When you laid out your algorithm of generating 4% top line growth and better than 4% operating income growth, inflation wasn't nearly as hot as it is today, particularly with respect to wage inflation. So looking out over the horizon over the next several quarters, how does the current environment impact Walmart's ability to sustain to generate this algorithm into next year, especially, Brett, as I think you just mentioned that some of the investments you were going to plan to make this year have been delayed into next year? Brett Biggs : Hey, Michael, it's Brett. I think as we -- the algorithm we talked about last year were a couple of things we mentioned. One was, at the time also we didn't see a stimulus coming -- didn't anticipate stimulus coming, which ended up coming. But I would look at that more as a mid-to long-term algorithm, which I think is the way we portrayed that when we discussed it. Certainly right now, we're seeing inflation in areas and some of that's demand driven and some of that's supply driven. Over time, things will likely work themselves out. But the context of how we think about the longer-term growth of Walmart has not changed. Michael Lasser : Okay. And my follow-up is for Doug. Walmart built a lot of new capabilities in the last couple of years like growing digital ad business, the driver delivery network, My Membership program. These new muscles are driving significant growth, but they're coming off a relatively low base. So, does Walmart need to make any substantive changes culturally operationally and how it deals with stakeholders like consumers or vendors or influence the ability to further gain scale in these areas? Are they operating at the level that you would expect at this point? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Michael. That's a good question. The thing that comes to mind is the change that has to happen and has happened to an extent and continues now related to working in a more digital fashion. We use a phrase here that's called four in a box, which is an agile way of working with customer, product, design, technology, engineering, all around the table, designing omnichannel outcomes for customers and members. Historically, if you look back years ago, the Company would have operated in specialized silos, merchandising operations, finance, logistics, etc., and the teams learned in recent years and is still learning how to move faster, again with the end in mind, designed with that outcome, and that enables us to put technology to work in a way that is truly omnichannel, not siloed. Customers and members expect that we've got unique opportunities to deliver that. But the change inside the Company has to happen to enable it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to give you guys a chance to talk a little bit more about how you activated your supply network and also your hiring tactics for seasonal labor. A couple of the numbers that struck us in the release were the inventory level and the labor count. If you could just talk a little bit about that 11% inventory increase, if there is any price in there that we need to be conscious of, and then 200,000 hires across, I think you said stores and supply chain, but maybe give us a sense of how that balance, where that labor resides relative to how your business has shifted more omnichannel. Thank you. Doug McMillon : This is Doug. I think for that answer, we need to get John, Judith and Kath to respond because the supply chain and hiring challenges are around the world. John, you want to kick it off? John Furner : Yeah. Love to. Good morning. First, we wanted to make sure that we were positioned well for customers. It's an important time of year in general merchandise and the food businesses as our customers prepare to celebrate holidays all across the country and we took a lot of steps early in the year to try to get ahead of what we thought could be some congestion and some other supply chain pressures that we've been facing throughout the year. Some of the things that helped us in the quarter, Brett mentioned a couple of things like chartering vessels, ensuring that we were forecasting appropriately and then managing the labor across each and every piece of the supply chain has been paramount to being able to deliver an increase in inventory, as you noted, of over 11%. Certainly, there were pressures all along the way, but no, I would just complement the teams at Walmart that operates the supply chain and not only general merchandise, but our food networks, both networks have been running extremely well. There's a lot of volume go into the networks, and the teams have been very innovative and approaches to solving these problems. The dispatch is very complex and there have been a number of places where we've seen acceleration that would be in throughput, inbound from our vendors and then outbound to our stores and fulfillment centers has been extremely strong. Judith McKenna : From a supply chain perspective for international, clearly each of our markets is in a slightly different position, but many of the actions that John described apply globally around the world. But I take something like Mexico. That market is about 93% domestically sourced. So those pressures are slightly different depending on the category. We spent the last couple of years expanding some of our supply chain capabilities and that's really stood us in good stead. And then, you've seen us ramping up our hiring in places like Canada pre the holiday season as well as quite normal for us, and we've had no issues with being able to do that. We're doing some good work tugging on some of the chartering of the vessels that the US is doing, and I think this is where our scale and capabilities really come in to play. And from an inventory perspective, we're up about 10% year-on-year but that's ex divestitures. Actually -- sorry, that's inc divestitures. Ex divestitures, it's even higher than that. And for the first time, I'll tell you that's a good thing because it actually positions us well as we're going into the peak of the holiday season. Kathryn McLay : Yeah. I would only just add on to say Sam's obviously gets to leverage the Walmart supply chain that's to our advantage. And we also work deliberately this year to pull forward inventory so we land at Halloween earlier, we land at Christmas earlier. So everything has just shifted up a little bit, which has put us in a good trading position. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to just ask a short-term question. So, looking at your guidance for 4Q, wondering if you could give some puts and takes on gross margin and SG&A. I appreciate there are a lot of moving parts on the wage front, but the implied 4Q flow-through on EBIT is significantly higher in 4Q than it was in 3Q. That's my first question. Brett Biggs : Yeah. Karen, this is Brett. But I think -- I think probably you answer your question a little bit as there are puts and takes as we look at the quarter as there has been for the last eight or nine quarters and there is really for every quarter. And as we look at all the potential things that we see in the supply chain, as we see in the labor market, as we see in pricing, the EPS guidance that we gave is kind of an amalgamation of all of those things. John Furner : Going to be a different mix in Q4 too that we'll sell. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Hey guys, good morning. It's kind of a question just around Walmart's positioning during periods of inflation, and recognizing that this is a level of inflation we haven't seen for a very long time. Can you just, Doug, maybe take us through how the business historically at least has responded, how customers have behaved? Are there trip changes? Is their trade down or your -- do you get access to new customers? Just curious, your kind of perspective in the event this inflationary environment persists for longer. Doug McMillon : Yeah, sure. Hi, Peter. I was thinking about Judith because she was reminding us this week, just how much inflation we've experienced inside Walmart around the world over time. We haven't seen this kind of inflation in the US for quite some time, but we have operated in markets where we've seen this basically forever and even more extreme. So that experience is helpful. We do start with wanting to keep prices low. The purpose of the Company is to save people money and help them with a better life, and we get excited about trying to do that. And the Company is kind of hedged well, if you think about it. With an inflationary environment, there are things that come along with that. And in a deflationary environment, we can leave down and we're a low-cost operator and we can take advantage of those situations. So in this case, our cost inflation is higher than our retail inflation and that's what we would want. But we've got lots of flexibility as we monitor price gaps to decide what we do with general merchandise, what we do with apparel, for example, and what we want to do with beef, with the inflation that's happening there and it becomes a mix management exercise with us trying to manage serving the customer member while managing the bottom line. We would care a little less about how the gross margin and SG&A balance out as we would with the net looks like. And so we're managing in that fashion and that's what you can expect us to do going forward. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Hey, everyone. Good morning. So, I guess I'll ask a multi-parter since maybe we're only getting one. First, on the gross margin, the down 12 and the mention of the supply chain pressure, how should we think about it being maybe a peak point and in pain in terms of supply chain costs and how it leads into next year? And I thought -- I think someone, I don't know if it was Kath or Judith, mention the buying forward of inventory. Is this inventory just on further upstream in the supply chain or it's already in your DCs and stores that can be deployed? John Furner : Hey, Simeon, it's John. Let me take the first part of the question and then we will handle the second part together. As far as gross margin, we start all these conversations with what's the right value for customers giving our position in the marketplace. And we've been pleased with the results in terms of price gaps over the last 18 months. We are in a better position than we were before the pandemic and we intend to keep our price gaps that way. As Doug mentioned, our cost inflation is definitely higher than retail. So we will -- we will hold on moving any retail as late as possible. And what you saw there in the quarter, in the third quarter, more specifically in gross margin, were costs that came through in terms of supply chain. That would be everything from our domestic supply chains, labor, international supply chains as well. And then we have benefits of lower markdowns and higher sell-throughs. That would include back to school -- we had a very good back to school season, Halloween sell-through, both in food and general merchandise, were very strong. And we see customers who are celebrating. We're pleased with our position as we go into Thanksgiving, and I've been at stores around the country and our feature mix looks much better than a year ago, definitely hit a holiday feel. Last year, we were pretty reliant on things like snacks and beverages to fill space and we were having inventory shortages. So I feel really good about the positioning going into the holiday season. We're proud of the 11.5% I mentioned some moment ago, but many ladies and gentlemen all over the country have worked very hard to make that number come to reality, including managing each piece, which is both offshore and domestically. I think the big advantage that Walmart has in times like this is, about two-thirds of what we source is sourced from the United States here in the country, and so we've got a lot of flexibility in terms of how we're able to balance this out. Kathryn McLay : I'll probably just add, it's Kath here, to say it's a little bit member sentiment as well as supply chain. So, we saw last year and again this year, the member sentiment of wanting to participate in seasonal events early. And so we took advantage of that and brought in the inventory earlier. We bought up 100% in Halloween costumes. We put them in earlier, we set them and we sold through them. I think Christmas, we've already had healthy sell-through. The rest of the inventory is in country and on its way to the club. So I think that's what we're seeing both in the member sentiment and us trying to pull forward from a supply chain perspective to make sure we can say we've got access to it. Judith McKenna : I would maybe just add to that -- it's Judith -- that we are prioritizing flow around the world and have been doing for some time. So those products which we know that customers and members need most, making sure that they've got places on the vessels when it's the international supply chain to bring them in. So in addition to people wanting to buy earlier, we've also been really thoughtful about how that product is coming in as well. John Furner : One of the most important things that happened quite a few months ago was, we all kind of held hands and decided to be aggressive. So the seasonal businesses that we're driving now, we made a call on that, maybe in some cases a year ago, and I think that helped us in terms of quantities, getting them through, getting them through earlier, and I think it's going to play out that way. I think it's going to be really strong. As it relates to whether it's peak or not, Simeon, there are variables like what happens with the virus, is the market going to continue opening up and people will consume services, travel and all those kinds of things and what does that mean to goods. So there is a demand side of this as well as a supply side of it, and I don't know that any of us can call exactly where the peak is going to be. But it doesn't really matter to us. We're going to manage through it regardless of what happens. And when we get an opportunity to take rollbacks, we're out there asking suppliers even now, do any of you want to get aggressive and swim upstream and take prices down while prices are going up to gain share, and we got so many suppliers to work with and choose from that you find people in some categories that can do things and as the months progress, we expect to find more of them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. It was mentioned in the prepared comments and the presentation about the impact of stimulus in Q3. And I was wondering if there was any way in which you can quantify how much stimulus had an impact in Q3 versus Q2, realizing of course that we're getting further away from initial stimulus, and what you're thinking of contribution of stimulus could look like in Q4. Brett Biggs : Kate, this is Brett. It's pretty challenging to try to quantify that impact with some of the other impacts that we're seeing as well. Obviously, there are some parts of the stimulus that wound down in Q3, things like child care credits that kept going through Q3. But demand is really strong -- unit demand is strong. On our stores, they're crowded. So we continue to see good demand, and I think as you come, as your question stated almost, as we get further and further away from stimulus, I think it makes us feel better and better about the demand for what we're doing. John Furner : And, Kate, specifically in the US -- good morning, it's John, by the way -- specifically in the US, we certainly see a consumer that has a strong balance sheet. We see spending levels higher, we see demand is higher, traffic being up 5.7% in the quarter is an encouraging sign. And then having categories like apparel lead the business which is discretionary. Our apparel team has done a great job positioning -- that's going into the back half of the year with new technology, new product. Having apparel lead is certainly encouraging. And then also, we're really proud of the results in food with two-year share gains and units accelerating retail gains I think gives us an indication of how the consumer is feeling and how they're going to be spending the rest of the year. Doug McMillon : It seems like the most pronounced thing we saw would be in hiring. Like when the stimulus dollars started to go away, the hiring situation changed faster. We saw people come back in a matter of weeks. We were back to being staffed. John Furner : Yeah, that's right, Doug. Doug McMillon : It was more pronounced than on the demand side. John Furner : Yes, it certainly was and certainly felt the impact of that early in the year when the Delta variant began. And then in the last quarter or so, we've added close to 200,000 people in the workforce. We're really excited to welcome the 200,000 new associates to the Company. About 25% of those are in the supply chain and the other 75% are stores and other areas. But that's been done to meet demand, and again, we're excited about our positioning in terms of people, product and our pricing. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bob Drbul : Hi. Two questions from me. Good morning. I guess the first one is, can you share a little perspective on the Walmart Plus membership program and what you've learned so far and how you feel about it? And the second question is, can you talk about I think the 21 million items you added in the Marketplace, I know that's been a big focus for you guys, so just love to hear sort of where you think you are at this point. Thanks. Brett Biggs : Sure, Bob. Good morning. First, really excited about the Walmart Plus program. We launched it just over a year ago with some really core values for the customer, which include unlimited delivery, primarily from stores, but that doesn't include e-commerce. The program also offers fuel discounts and Scan and Go and then most recently we offered early access to customers' -- Plus members who are shopping on our holiday events. So our Plus members now have about a four-hour window to be able to access product ahead of the market and certainly seeing great results from that. Plus is a really important part of our growth strategy over the long term. We know once a member -- a customer becomes a member and typically those are members that are joining who are already pickup customers, and we know their spend increases and our first-place wallet share grows. So looking forward to the progress that we'll be able to make of in time. And the second part of your question, could you repeat? Bob Drbul : Just some perspective on the e-commerce marketplace. The 21 million new items, I know that's been a focus. So just where you guys think you are at this point. Brett Biggs : Yes, we're currently about 160 million items available. So 21 million growth in the quarter is a really nice gain. And we certainly see high demand from marketplace sellers. And one of the services that we're excited about is Walmart Fulfillment Services. We can scale that business just about as quickly as we'll be able to add capacity. So, got a lot of great plans in the supply chain. We've talked about supply chain a number of times this year, but we've got a lot of innovation and investments in the supply chain that we're very excited about to add capacity for the overall network. But this certainly will include and support our marketplace sellers and have a great seller value proposition as we look forward. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Ben Bienvenu : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I want to ask a sort of two-part question related to, Brett, your commentary around ROIC and some of the team's broader commentary around wage investment relative to inflation. You're at one of the strongest ROIC metrics that you've seen in some time. You're talking about, it sounds like being pretty competitively positioned relative to hiring and being able to staff up back to full staffing as the stimulus fell off. You've also been investing in wages. I'm curious, with all of those variables in place and inflationary backdrop, how do you feel about your level of investment around wages and into the organization? And do you think that we're in an environment where you can deliver against the productivity loop that we are also focused on at the start of this year? Brett Biggs : Yeah. Hi, Ben. How are you doing? I'll go back to really what we talked about in February which came up on a question earlier. I still feel really good about the long-term algorithms -- mid to long-term algorithms that we discussed in February about being able to grow operating income faster than sales as a company going forward. And that would portend to I think shareholders over time being pleased with the direction of ROI. We have some capital to invest, and John's talked a lot about that, particularly in the US side on supply chain, and we're going to do that because we think it's going to help us long-term on both the top line and bottom line. But I am pleased with where we are from an ROI standpoint. We're focused on it, and I think over time it should continue to grow as the Company. Doug McMillon : One of the things we mentioned in February was the importance of automation, and we'll be talking more about that in the future. But if you just go back and review what we said there, we've got opportunities in distribution centers, fulfillment centers, around the world to deploy new technology that will help us with productivity and that will take some capital investment, but if you look at what it delivers on the other side for customers and members as well as from a productivity point of view, we continue to be excited about that. Brett Biggs : And last thing I'd add, Ben, just certainly, the focus on top line Doug mentioned a few minutes ago, but we made decisions about over a year ago to certainly be aggressive with inventory positioning, and the team is really focused on top line growth. One of the fun things in retail is adding up the score every day and that starts with the revenue and with revenue growth, we are in a position where we can leverage our fixed costs. And then, as you've heard all throughout the call this morning, in the middle, we can manage, and we've got a team who are great at managing the middle, and the middle would include things like cost, gross margins, wages, the other factors in the middle. But overall we're happy to position and ability to manage. And last thing I'd say is, we're excited about the investments in wages and associates on this last round positively affected about 565,000 people. It's a really large number, 565,000 people got a raise, and we're proud to be able to be in a position to do that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Grom : Hey, thank you. Great quarter. I just wonder if you could just unpack some of the moving parts on the third quarter US gross margin compression of 12 basis points, and I guess looking ahead, how you see that line item playing out in the fourth quarter. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Chuck. We didn't give guidance any specific lines on Q4, but I think it demonstrates again what we've said for many years. Just all the levers that we have to pull as a company to be able to -- for P&L to work at the same time that we're serving customers the way that we want to, and really Q3 would be no different from the standpoint of levers moving one way or the other. Certainly had supply chain cost pressure, just some input cost pressures. But then when you get the demand that we're having at least a lower markdowns -- fuel was a pressure in Q3 which sometimes it's a positive sometimes a negative. Feel really good about our advertising business, John, and the growth that we're seeing in the US but also globally. So it's all these things that come together and as a management team, cost side and margin side, it's up to us to manage those pieces in a way that gets to the results that we had in Q3 and the results that we've guided for in Q4. So, we've managed through a lot of different environments over the last eight or nine quarters in particular and feel good about this team's ability to continue to do it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Edward Yruma : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. A quick two-parter for me. I guess, first, you guys have added a lot of capabilities and use of AI. I'm really interested in understanding how it's made you change how you manage the business. Have you been able to get faster? And then as a follow-up on marketplace, nice growth in assortment. It does seem like a lot of marketplace participants are selling items that are out of stock in the core Walmart business. I guess how is your view on kind of marketplace in terms of enhancing the assortment versus offering consumers products that may be sold out at Walmart? Thank you. John Furner : So let me take -- good morning, Edward. This is John. Couple of things on your first question, sort of about capabilities. First, the team has really changed the way they work over the last couple of years. We mentioned a few minutes ago a more digital way of working, which we call in the business four in the box. And quite simply, we look for customer problems, associate problems, friction in the environment. And then we assemble a team of people which would include someone representing the customer, the business, product, technology, design, and these groups work through each of the problems and create digital products to take the friction out. Along the way, the real benefit is the data that's generated from these products. One example is, we're managing our backrooms of supercenters and there have been markets around the country using computer vision and augmented reality to not only know what's in the backroom, but what can be moved to the floor and we use AR -- augmented reality is a way for associates to know how to direct work, and from that we generate literally billions of pieces of data every week and it's helping us with overall inventory management. And I think our in-stock positions reflect that work as an example. Second, on the marketplace, we've taken more of an open approach on the marketplace and we are ensuring that each of our search and recall algorithms are working on behalf of the customer. What's really important in retail is knowing your customer, understanding the customer's intent, and then taking into catalog, whether it's 1P or 3P and matching the items that they are looking for and then it's up to the team here to execute. And we've got a really clear customer value index that we think about each and every day online, and we measure ourselves to that. So we're really centered on, as we've said a couple of times this morning, really centered on revenue growth, focused on the customer and then we'll work through the other pressures as Brett mentioned like we have the last eight or nine quarters. We're using ML and AI to do a number of different things. We used it to help adjust to the pandemic and use the stores as fulfillment hubs. We use it for predictive baskets, smart substitutions. Our in-stock assistance is AI empowered. And this modernization that we've been talking about with you guys in previous meetings is continuing, which unlocks more capability to use that data. We've moved 153 petabytes of data to the cloud so far, and we've got room to grow there. And we can put data and machines to work in ways in this company that we've not yet done, but we are making progress. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Robbie Ohmes : Good morning, guys. I'm going to break the rule on the one question, just to let you know ahead of time. Doug, I was hoping, can you frame the digital advertising opportunity for us a little bit, both maybe US and international? You guys I think have mentioned it quite a bit on this call. How big is it now? How big can it get as you're developing? And then just my add-on question is just, I don't think you guys spoke about the gas prices rising. And maybe remind us -- maybe, John, you could remind us the gas price impact on the customer outlook for Walmart which was going up so much. John Furner : Hey, Robbie, I would expect you to break that rule. I mean, as it relates to digital advertising, we are really excited about it. Obviously, we're coming off a smaller base than some others. We've shared that the two-year stack is 240% in the US. At some point, we may share a number with you. We're obviously talking about that. The thing I'm excited about, it's happening everywhere. I mean, Judith is driving an advertising income business around the world and this flywheel that we showed you guys in February is coming to life across markets in a way that generates a different business model that will change the Company in the long term and it's happening in -- we're excited about the fact we've got traction in a number of different areas. Gas prices are a concern. They're a concern, not just in this country, but everywhere. They're up dramatically versus a year ago, and the customers had money. And at some point, that's going to come to an end. Hopefully, that's a gradual process, and hopefully gas prices come down, and we sell a lot of fuel and in both Walmart US and Sam's, we're trying to help keep those prices down. Doug McMillon : I'd just pick up a couple of things, Robbie. Excited about the momentum. I'd like the way the team has positioned the business and call it Walmart Connect. It connects buyers, sellers and customers on the platform. And that's really important that everything we do is centered around the customer. And in the last quarter, we added a new Chief Revenue Officer, Seth Dallaire. Excited to have Seth on board and looking forward to the impact he'll be able to make in the ad business. And as I've said on fuel, certainly we're watching the pricing in fuel. Where we can offer a value, we will and we do. But we know that Americans spend a large percentage of their income on food and energy. And so, with pressure on energy prices then certainly it's up to us, the team, to do everything we can to keep prices low and to fight inflation and the team's doing a nice job of that. Judith McKenna : It's Judith. Maybe just on our [Indecipherable] International. One of the other things to add is the way that we're sharing technology but also capabilities around the world. So that flywheel built out using the capabilities that we're building in different markets to support markets that are earlier in that journey is really important. So, for example, the Flipkart ad-tech platform which has developed and really quite mature. We're deploying that in Chile, for example, whereas Walmart Connect, that program is deploying in Mexico and Canada. So another great one of those areas where not only is it benefiting all of the markets pretty much around the world. It's also ultimately being built off share capabilities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks, guys. Could you talk about cost inflation on the grocery side of the business versus general merchandise? What are you seeing on each and how do you think that compares to what competitors might be seeing and what you expect them to do in terms of passing it through to the consumer, and how does that influence your decision about pricing? Thanks. John Furner : Good morning, Paul. This is John. First, as we said earlier, our unit growth in grocery is growing faster than dollars and that's a position we'd like to stay in as long as we possibly can. We want to keep prices low for customers all across the business and we'll be the last to go up. So, we're happy with our price positioning. We see gaps that are wider now than they were before the pandemic began and we intend to maintain that position. As far as the mix goes, it's relatively even across the business, so there aren't areas with probably the exception of the beef category that really stand out from grocery to general merchandise. But we've got solid growth in general merchandise as well, leading the businesses, apparel; our health and wellness business has been strong. So the Supercenter and the overall business has an ability to mix that's quite helpful. And in the last quarter, part of the margin compression, we were down about 12 basis points, was benefited by mix, it was benefited by higher sell-through and then was also benefited by lower markdowns as a result of those sell-throughs. And then we had supply chain costs that came through. So the team at Walmart have a broad portfolio of categories and a broad portfolio of levers that they can use to keep prices low for customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question. Joe Feldman : Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to something that you guys mentioned earlier in the call. I think, Doug, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing that the pandemic causing shifts in shopping behavior, which we all talked about a lot. And then a little later, I think you guys talked about seeing some of those behavior shifting away from what we saw during the pandemic. And I was hoping you could share some thoughts on basically what you're seeing and what you expect to stay with us for the long term in terms of some of these behavior changes in terms of shopping. Doug McMillon : I think pickup and delivery around the world will grow and the step change that occurred will stay and then grow from there probably at a lower rate. That's what we're seeing here. But the store traffic's the biggest issue. When the pandemic enabled it, people came back to stores; and I think they like stores. They want to have that experience. They enjoy seeing merchandise, being around each other, and that's why omni channel makes so much sense. So grateful for that. There are other things like telehealth that will persist forever. The goods versus services trade-off that happened during the lockdowns and during the heavier pandemic period were definitely a big deal. We'll see how that plays out over time. People eating at home. I think they've enjoyed that, and they're going to do more of that. And that gets us an opportunity across all of our formats around the world. Is there anything any of you would add to that? I think we covered it. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : I'll just wrap up by saying that we appreciate your attention on Walmart. And hopefully what you can see is that the business is changing. We can sell customers and members things in a variety of ways. We can make money doing it. The business model's changing, the digital transformation's underway, this is a different Company than it was and we've got a lot of runway in front of us. We're looking now at our input metrics; we're not just enjoying the benefits of some of these tailwinds and feeling like we're certainly a company that's arrived. We're paying attention to net promoter scores; we're working on the things underneath that will enable us to continue to grow regardless of what the environment is like. There will be a point in time some point in the future where you guys will be asking us about deflation and you'll be asking us about how we're going to grow share, and we're focused on growing share today and in that environment. We run the Company for the long term, manage it for the short-term and really proud of what the team is doing to make that happen and grateful to our associates. Have a great day.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Dan Binder, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Dan, you may now begin. Dan Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to Walmart\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO, Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide an update on the business and discuss fourth quarter and full year results that will be followed by our question-and-answer session.  Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded, and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning and thanks for joining us to hear about our fourth quarter results. Let's jump right in. Our team delivered net sales growth of 7.6% and adjusted EPS growth of 9.3%, excluding divestitures. We continued to gain market share in food and consumables in the U.S. and comp transactions were positive. Consumer demand during the quarter was strong. And the team overcame a number of challenges in the U.S. and around the world to deliver these strong results.  Going into the quarter, we were confident that we had the people, the products and the prices to deliver. And we did. Our inventory position improved and we delivered high sell throughs in seasonal categories across markets. Food, consumables and apparel were also strong globally. We comped low single digits in general merchandize in the U.S. against strong results last year. And Sam's Club saw broad based strength across categories in the U.S. and in China. Our merchants are doing a nice job of navigating the pressure from cost of goods inflation with our customers and shareholders in mind.  I like how we're mixing out the business. Consolidated gross profit rate increased 10 basis points for the quarter, including more than 50 basis points in Walmart U.S. We\u2019re working closely with our suppliers to manage inflation, finding a few places where we can roll back prices. And we're paying close attention to how we manage our opening price point items. Q4 and the full year are proof points that we can keep our price gaps in the range where we want them, grow market share and deliver against our top and bottom line growth algorithm.  Our associates did an amazing job of serving customers and members during this busy season even as we faced Omicron and supply chain challenges. This quarter\u2019s COVID lead peak was larger than anything we'd experienced in 2020 or previously in 2021. We hired more associates and our plan called for to help fill that gap, which negatively impacted expenses, but it was clearly needed. I'm grateful to our associates and store and club management teams for how they set priorities on behalf of our customers and members during the quarter.  As I visit stores and clubs, it's inspiring to see how our team is navigating such a fluid environment. They're delivering tremendous growth while making significant progress against our longer term strategy. During the fiscal year just ended excluding divestitures, we grew net sales by 9%, grew operating profit by 18%, invested $13 billion in CapEx to grow our business returned $16 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends, grew our advertising business globally to $2.1 billion and took important steps to build our U.S. financial services capabilities with agreements to make two key acquisitions.  Sometimes it feels like 2020 and 2021, were just one long year. If you look at growth since the beginning of fiscal \u201821, through the end of fiscal \u201822, excluding divestitures, our company is about 17% larger in terms of revenue, 31% larger in terms of operating income, and globally our percentage of digital sales grew from 6% to 13%. As the company grows, we're fueled by the new business model and flywheel we outlined last year. Our strategy is coming to life. Ensuring that we deliver our strategy is where I invest the majority of my time. It starts with a customer and earning primary destination. The big basket stock up trip is important. It's foundational to our relationship with families. We earn that shopping occasion by running great stores and clubs and offering seamless pickup and delivery experiences, including for our Walmart+ and InHome members in the U.S. Our membership offering Walmart+ continues to be an important piece of what we're building. We're adding capacity for pickup and delivery. We increased capacity by nearly 20% last year, and we expect to increase capacity by another 35% this year. For Walmart InHome, we recently announced an expansion of this membership service to make it available to about 30 million homes in the U.S., up from 6 million. To enable the expansion, we're creating roles for more than 3000 associate delivery drivers. The majority of these roles will be filled by existing experienced associates. We'll be building out a fleet of all electric delivery vans to support our delivery services, and our goal of a zero emissions logistics fleet by 2040.  Our flywheel is designed to serve families more broadly, deepening our relationship with them and creating a healthy mix of merchandize and services for our business. Recently, we shared some news about our fintech startup in the U.S. that will operate under the ONE brand going forward. The combined talent of our JV leadership team and out of the pending acquisitions of ONE Finance and Even is impressive, and our plans are aggressive. We can help our customers and Walmart+ members save money, have an experience with less friction and help strengthen the financial position for millions of families.  As with our advertising business, our financial services capabilities cross borders. Our PhonePe business in India is growing incredibly fast and we have strong capabilities in Mexico, which is such an important market for us. As we look to improve the customer experience and strengthen the mix of our business, expanding our marketplace is important. We added more than 20,000 new sellers to the platform in the U.S. last year, and expect to add nearly 40,000 more this year. We're now up to nearly 170 million SKUs. And we're adding more every day. We opened up our U.S. marketplace to sellers from India, and created a dedicated team there to help sellers onboard and grow.  Many sellers are looking to diversify their business and they're pushing us to add capabilities including the expansion of our fulfillment services. We grew our U.S. GMV delivered by our fulfillment services by 500% last year. We expect the robust growth will continue this year as we add more capacity. For Q4, our fulfillment services represented 44% of total marketplace orders in India, and 22% in Mexico. Growing our marketplace expands choice for our customers, helps our sellers grow and enhances our profit margins.  Our plan for this year includes strengthening the experience for sellers and adding fulfillment capacity, so customers have access to more items faster. It's clear to me that we have years of profitable marketplace and fulfillment services growth ahead of us. Staying on the theme of fulfillment and scaling new businesses. We recently launched Walmart GoLocal, a last mile delivery solution using our Spark Driver platform to help businesses of all sizes reach more customers. GoLocal is making deliveries for the Home Depot and other large retailers. But I'm most excited about serving small local retailers.  We have nearly 1000 GoLocal service pickup points and we expect to end this year closer to 5,000. This is good for customers, our clients and for us as we lower the cost per order by increasing the combined order size and the route density. As we bring more customers, sellers and suppliers into our ecosystem, it expands our ability to monetize those relationships. A great example is our advertising business. Globally, it's been growing at a high rate with high margins and is now a $2.1 billion business and only a few years, and we expect this strong growth to continue. And as our e-commerce business including marketplace continues to grow, so will our advertising business. We're taking the learnings from the U.S. and India and growing in places like Mexico, Canada and Chile.  Importantly, we're beginning to build tech platforms that can be leveraged in multiple countries. Our strong team of technologists and our digital transformation enable global synergies. We see traction in our core business as well as in our newer businesses. There's real power and the ability to make these pieces mutually reinforcing. To design them such that one portion of a customer relationship leads them to another because it's easy and intuitive, connecting B2B opportunities like advertising, enables us to grow earnings and make key investments at the same time.  Because of how the flywheels coming together, I feel great about our ability to deliver against the growth algorithm we discussed last year, about 4% top-line growth, and operating income growth rates higher than sales. We've highlighted the increased costs we had in Q4 from COVID, supply chain and wages. And some of these costs are likely to continue through part of this year. But I feel confident in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to deliver the growth we expect. The Walmart we're building is becoming more impactful for our customers and members. More digital, more automated, and more diversified on the top and bottom lines.  Now let's move on to our performance by operating segment. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. The team had a great holiday season. They drove comp sales of 5.6%. You know about our strength and food and consumables. But despite the supply chain challenges, the seasonal hardlines execution for holiday looked good and stores. We\u2019re continuing to navigate cost pressures and in stock challenges. But overall, I'm really proud of the team for delivering the holiday season. And I believe we'll work our way to an improved in stock level through the course of the year.  Building a seamless omni channel experience for customers and prioritizing convenience for them is critical. Our stores have become hybrid. They're both stores and fulfillment centers. Last year, we increased the number of orders coming from our stores by 170% versus the previous year. And that's on top of more than 500% from the year before. Having inventory so close to so many customers is a competitive advantage. In some cases, we're getting items to customers in hours rather than days.  In Sam's Club U.S. the momentum continues. Sales and membership were strong, excluding fuel and tobacco, comps were 10.8% for the quarter and nearly 26% on a two year stack. Membership income grew 9.1% driven by membership count, which reached another record high during the quarter. The team leveraged operating expenses and grew operating income 24% excluding fuel. They had another fantastic quarter and year. Sam\u2019s continues to drive digital innovation and add capabilities. Our Bold & Blue Club remodels and are strengthened pickup and delivery services will drive growth.  At Walmart International, we had another strong year with good progress in all aspects of the flywheel. Overall sales were strong again in Q4 with growth of 9.8% in constant currency excluding divestitures. China, Mexico and Flipkart led the way. Our 21% e-commerce penetration is a new record and up nearly 400 basis points from last year. We get to serve a spectrum of holidays and festivals during the holiday quarter from Diwali and Big Billion Days in India through to preparation for Chinese New Year.  During Big Billion Days, 40% of sellers were first time sellers on the marketplace, and more than 100,000, kiranas participated by making last mile deliveries. This has strong inclusive growth. While our omnichannel model gives the gift of time, access and affordability remain important. We're expanding our ecosystem and we've made investments in areas such as health care, marketplace telecommunications and our online food business. A few great examples include the launch of Flipkart Health Plus that aims to increase access to affordable care in India. And the acquisition of Foodmaestro in Canada to build more personalized shopping experiences for customers. And, BAIT, our value-based internet and telephone service that enables customers in Mexico to enjoy digital connectivity surpassed 2 million members.  It's great to see all three of our operating segments doing so well. I'm grateful to our strong and capable leadership team and to all of our associates. We've had an incredible couple of years during these challenging times. We have momentum in the business. We have aggressive plans, and we're executing on the strategy. It still feels like we're just getting started.  I'll now turn it over to Brett. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug. We wrapped up another great year with a strong fourth quarter and good momentum as we start the New Year. Over the last couple of years, each quarter has presented unique challenges, but I'm proud of how we've navigated each one of those. The fourth quarter was no different as we faced the rise of Omicron with its impact on the supply chain and our associates. This resulted in some significant unexpected expenses. But despite that, we delivered the top and bottom line results we expected.  We continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to fulfill the vision we outlined last February. The U.S. flywheel is accelerating and is evident through initiatives like our pending fintech JV acquisitions, the launch of a new data business and acceleration of last mile delivery. Sam\u2019s growth and membership income has been strong throughout the year as we expand Omni options including club pickup. These and other key initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next few years.  For the full year, we had record sales of $568 billion with increased traffic to stores and clubs. While e-commerce penetration approached 13% Walmart U.S. grew sales by more than $23 billion and saw strong market share gains in food and consumables. Over the past two years, our U.S. segments have grown sales by $67 billion, or 17%, and operating income by 25%.  Now let's discuss Q4 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments today will exclude the effect of divestitures. Total constant currency revenue grew 7.9% to over $153 billion and reached another important milestone with quarterly net sales exceeding $150 billion. Consolidated gross margin rate increased 5 basis points with Walmart us gross margin rate increasing by healthy 54 basis points, reflecting primarily price management resulting from cost increases in mix along with benefits from a growing advertising business partially offset by higher supply chain costs.  Supply chain costs were over $400 million higher than expected, but we expect some of those costs to abate overtime. International gross margin rates were lower due primarily to format mix. SG&A expenses deleveraged 19 basis points as increased us wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower COVID costs versus last year.  Although COVID costs were lower than last year, we have significantly higher associate lead costs in the U.S. than anticipated. In the first three quarters combined. COVID lead costs were about $600 million but increased over $450 million just in Q4, presenting an unexpected headwind of over $300 million. Despite these expense challenges, adjusted operating income increased more than 6% and EPS increased more than 9%.  We're in a great financial position, enabling us to allocate capital towards both growth and shareholder returns. Free cash flow was $11.1 billion for the year, down versus last year due primarily to inventory build throughout the year, higher CapEx and cost increases. We increased share repurchases significantly this year with buybacks of just under $10 billion, a pace we plan to continue or increase in the coming year given our view of the long-term value of the company. In addition, we announced the 49th consecutive annual dividend increase this morning. ROI increased 90 basis points to just under 15%, the best level in 5 years due primarily to growth in operating income. Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had its first ever $100 billion plus sales quarter with sales of $105 billion. Comp sales grew 5.6%, up more than 14% on a two-year stack. We continue to grow grocery market share as food comps increased high-single digits, while Health & Wellness, apparel, seasonal and automotive categories were also strong. Transactions were up more than 3% despite COVID pressures. E-commerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year, resulting in a 70% two-year stack. We continue to see elevated levels of cost inflation and have taken prudent steps to manage pricing while having slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic. We have a good balance of growing market share while managing price with both customers and shareholders in mind. We continue to make strong progress in some of our newer higher margin initiatives. Walmart Connect advertising experienced robust sales growth this year with a strong pipeline of new advertisers and large growth opportunities ahead. In fact, the number of active advertisers using Walmart Connect grew more than 130% year-over-year. And about half of the ad sales came from automated channels in Q4, more than double last year. We expect Walmart Connect to continue to scale over the next few years with plans to become a top-10 ad business in the midterm. Growing eCommerce marketplace at WFS have been a priority over the past couple of years as we've invested to expand fulfillment capacity, introduce new services for sellers and double the number of items available for customers. In fact, we expect to have over 200 million items in our e-commerce assortment by the end of the year. The expansion of WFS has also been a key unlock in bringing more sellers to Walmart's marketplace. Customers increasingly want home delivery, and we had a six fold increase in delivery in the fourth quarter versus pre-pandemic levels. We continue expanding capabilities, including announcing the acceleration of in-home delivery to 30 million households by year-end. We also announced our new fintech business ONE in January, with the pending acquisitions of fintech platforms ONE Finance and Even. SG&A expenses deleveraged 95 basis points as increased wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower total COVID-related expenses year-over-year. Still, as I mentioned earlier, COVID leave costs were much higher than expected. Operating income grew slightly, aided by strong margins as well as solid growth in membership and other income. Inventory increased about 28% overall, including higher cost of goods due to inflation, mix and higher-than-normal in transit shipments, reflecting continued efforts to improve in-stock. International sales were strong, up nearly 10%, led by China, Mexico and Flipkart as seasonal events, omni growth and good inventory position contributed to results. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 21% on top of strong gains last year with growth of more than 75% on a two-year stack. China comps increased nearly 20% in constant currency with continued strength from Sam's Clubs as well as more than 90% growth in e-commerce sales. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 8% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD. Flipkart had another good sales quarter, aided by strong holiday events and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with TPV of more than 130% versus last year with a current run-rate of $650 billion. In Canada, comp sales were up 4.6%, led by in-store shopping and comps increased more than 13% on a two-year stack. International adjusted operating income in constant currency increased nearly 3%, reflecting lower COVID costs, partly offset by gross margin rate decrease related to higher sales penetration from Sam's China and eCommerce. For the full year, International adjusted operating income grew 12.7%. And we feel confident about our international business as we head into the New Year. Sam's Club had another impressive quarter with comps up 10.8%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of nearly 26% on a two-year stack. Transactions increased 7% and ticket was up 3.2%. eCommerce sales grew 21%, and we expanded the rollout of delivery capabilities of digital orders to nearly all clubs during the quarter. Sam's is leveraging Walmart's GoLocal last mile delivery service to provide more convenience to members. Membership income was up more than 9% with another record in member counts and strong Plus penetration. Operating income was up 41% as higher fuel and membership income as well as strong expense leverage were partially offset by gross margin pressure from inflation and supply chain costs. Now let's turn to guidance. We feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and believe we can deliver full year growth in FY '23 that aligns with the growth algorithm we discussed last year. As you saw in Q4, we're still challenged with increased costs related to COVID and supply chain disruptions. Our guidance assumes that we will see some relief from that as the year progresses and that the U.S. consumer remains in a generally favorable economic position throughout the year. The comparisons against last year is unique, primarily due to the timing of international divestitures and U.S. stimulus in FY '22. As a reminder, the divestitures of our businesses in the UK and Japan were completed near the end of the first quarter last year, contributing about $5 billion in sales and about $0.07 of EPS in Q1, FY '22. Our guidance will be ex-divestitures. We expect total company sales to increase about 4% with Walmart U.S. comp sales slightly above 3% for the year. Given the timing of stimulus overlaps, we expect about a 1% to 2% comp sales increase from Walmart U.S. in the first quarter, followed by somewhat higher comp sales growth throughout the remainder of the year.  We expect FY '23 total company operating income to increase at a rate slightly higher than sales growth and EPS to grow 5% to 6% versus FY '22 adjusted EPS due in part to our aggressive share repurchase program. The quarterly profit growth cadence is expected to be quite variable due to last year's U.S. stimulus as well as lapping wage investments initiated in February and September 2021. As you would expect, the variability of the quarters looks less extreme when viewed on a two-year stack.  We expect Q1 operating income and EPS to be down low-double digits to low-teens as we cycle the stimulus effects from last year that resulted in nearly 30% operating income growth, as well as increased wages this year. On a two-year stack, Q1 operating income would still be up a mid-teens percentage.  Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS are expected to increase at low to mid-single digit rates as year-over-year comparisons ease due in part to the moderation of stimulus benefits last year. We expect higher growth rates in the back half of the year, as we fully cycle wage investments resulting in fourth quarter operating income and EPS increasing by a high-teens percentage. Q4 operating income will also benefit from some timing versus FY '22, particularly in international as well as cycling elevated COVID leave costs in FY '22. Our effective tax rate is expected to increase to 25% to 26% due primarily to earnings mix. For the year, we expect gross margin rates to increase due to pricing, mix and new business initiatives. Although there will be variability quarter-to-quarter as is usually the case.  For the first time in a while, we expect some expense deleveraging as we continue to see elevated supply chain wage and tech costs. We'll continue the multiyear journey of accelerated capital investment focused on increasing fulfillment capacity, automation and technology to enhance productivity.  FY '22 CapEx was about $13.1 billion, lower than anticipated due to timing of projects impacted by supply chain challenges. Due to that and continued investment in strategic priorities, we anticipate this year's CapEx being at the upper end of the guidance we gave last year of 2.5% to 3% of sales. In closing, I'm really pleased with our FY '22 results. I'm very confident as I look to this year and to the future. The company is in an enviable position to serve customers and members and also to achieve our financial goals, benefiting shareholders. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to double-click on one of the comments you made in your remarks regarding elevated levels of inflation. And I think you signaled that you are seeing slightly wider price gaps versus pre-pandemic. Can you maybe give us some sense of how much inflation you're observing real time? How much those price gaps have widened and then what your expectations are for the quarters as the year progresses. John Furner : Hey, Steph. Good morning. This is John with Walmart U.S. Now, the first, I just want to appreciate our teams for all they delivered in the last quarter, the $105 billion sales number has been impressive, given all the challenges they have. And I just want to thank the teams for everything they've been through the last couple of years. When it comes to pricing, we really take a long-term view on this. And we manage pricing for both customers and shareholders. We're constantly monitoring our share, our price gaps to competitors. And we'll continue to do that as we move forward. And then what we're seeing right now is not only gaps that we're proud of that are valuable for our customers, but we're also seeing the opportunity to increase some of our rollbacks in stores. And we're really proud of the team. We're seeing about the same number of rollbacks now that we had at the end of Q1 last year.  So while we have supply chain challenges and other costs coming through, the teams are doing a nice job managing mix and pricing and looking after both our customers and our shareholders. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Bob Drbul : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. The first one really, thanks for giving us the advertising piece. Can you just elaborate a little bit more just on the growth that you've experienced to get to the $2 billion number? And just how quickly you do expect that to ramp? And given the fact that you gave us the $2 billion number, Doug, would you be willing to give us how many people have signed up for the Walmart+ membership Doug McMillon : Bob, you got one and you want both. That doesn't surprise me. I'll start with the advertising number, and John can add here. The business model is changing. I think that's the headline. We've got a business that's becoming increasingly digital, the eCommerce business, first party, third party is growing. It gives us the opportunity to grow advertising income. It's grown at a fast rate, and it's growing across markets.  The U.S. is important in that number. But India, Mexico and other markets are going to have growth there, too. And the margins are helpful. They help us keep prices low for customers and they help us deliver the operating income number percentage. So we're excited about what the future looks like as it relates to the growth of the advertising business.  We're not going to share Walmart+ yet. I don't really want to have the company defined by one metric. And with subscriptions being such a topic these days. Everybody gets really focused on that. Walmart is always going to be a business where you need to look across and see how the omnichannel business is playing out. There are going to be times when eCommerce grows faster than stores. And as we've seen recently, stores are attractive during certain periods of time. Walmart+ is important. It helps us grow our eCommerce business. It helps us deepen the relationship with customers and have more data. And at some point, we'll probably talk about that number. And by the way, there are other types of memberships, not just in Sam's Club across the world, but in some of our other businesses too, that are growing. So I think there will probably be a number of membership type metrics over time that you'll want to keep an eye on. But I don't think it would be good if we're going to get overly focused on Walmart+. Our ability to serve people with pickup and delivery has improved as we've made these investments. It's one of the reasons why we continue to tell you how much capacity we're growing to do that. John Furner : Yeah, Bob, this is John. And then a couple of things. First, I think the advertising business is a reflection of the momentum we have in total Walmart U.S. And I'm really proud of the way the team has helped position us to serve customers any way they want to be served, whether that's at home, in the refrigerator, at their front door, at the curb or in store. And the Walmart Connect business, specifically the reason we named it Connect, is we're connecting buyers, sellers, suppliers and customers. And we have a unique opportunity to be able to help sellers and suppliers reach customers in a way that's effective for them, grow their business and do it in a way that is positioned on top of an omni retail platform. So certainly, excited about the growth, I'm excited about the capacity additions in store and in Walmart Fulfillment Services. Those enable sellers to be able to transact more frequently with our customers. And that's really the key to the growth of advertising is have the large seller and supplier base that can reach our customer base. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. So Doug, I wanted to ask you a question. You've made the plane analogy in the past with respect to knowing when and where you want to land the plane, but there are moving parts to getting to the destination. So I wanted to just ask bigger picture when you think about '23 specifically well calendar '22, where you think the biggest source of upside could be to landing the plane. And then also where you'd put the biggest sources of risk on landing? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Karen. I think the biggest sources of risk are external. It's been an unusual last year or two and figuring out how you lap stimulus, what happens with inflation, both on the cost of goods side as well as on the operating side will cause us to have to be good managers. But I think we've demonstrated over time that we have a lot of really good managers at Walmart. In terms of upside, I'm excited about what's happening in our stores and clubs. We've got great momentum in Sam's. There's a lot to be excited about in international. India continues to be really exciting. Walmex is kind of going from strength to strength Sam's business in China is good. So I think that Sam's International can contribute.  And then the Walmart U.S. side, John, you can jump in here too. I think we've got an opportunity to continue to improve both stores and eCommerce. And the fact that we're now up to 170 million items for customers is exciting and the way sellers are responding to fulfillment and seller services. And that relationship is really encouraging. So I think marketplace is one of those areas where we can see growth, including that last mile component that we're building out. I think that's exciting too. John Furner : Add too Karen I mentioned just a second ago, proud of the momentum and the positioning being an omni retailer. But also excited about the shape of the business model and how it's changing. Brett laid out last year, early the growth algorithm and the way that the business model could change over time. And the services that Doug just referenced for sellers, including Fulfillment and Marketplace, Last Mile, GoLocal, all these things help so many businesses reach customers in addition to just the Walmart business. And they all have an impact on the operating model, which I'm really quite excited about.  And these are components that will help customers, number one, they'll help shareholders and they'll help us position the way that we offer value to customers all across the country.  So at GoLocal, we talked about the number of points that we have today. That's expanding. Our Last Mile business is expanding. We'll have a fleet of electric vehicles coming online over the next couple of years. So there\u2019s just a lot going on that is going to take a lot of friction out of customers' lives, help them stay in stock at home.  And then with the improvement in fundamentals over the next year. I'm also very excited about our ability to manage through whatever external forces that we see. We've got a lot of experience doing this. We\u2019ve got great team that are ready for this. And the strategy is really clear. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Hey, good morning, everyone. My question is on guidance. In '22, you beat your comp guidance and your EBIT guidance, both by healthy amounts. If '23 ends up being better than what you just guided. Is it driven by sales or is there a chance the margin can perform better within the three given some of the alternative?  And then just to clarify, Brett mentioned the Q4 EBIT growth for fiscal '23. Is there any way you could unpack it a little because it does -- it's a big change in jump, but it seems like you're going to be lapping some hefty SG&A growth. And you said something about international laps. So just try to maybe -- it's not as steep as it sounds, I think, if we look at some of the pieces. Brett Biggs : Hey, Simeon. It's Brett. I'll kick off. I think a lot of what Doug and John just said is if there were -- if we get to the end of this year and we've done better than we've laid out for guidance, I think it's a lot of what they just talked about. Our new businesses that are higher margin continue to grow. Sales momentum continues. We assume, obviously this is going to continue with a 4% sales growth. That's a big number on top of what we've already done.  So it could be sales driven, and it can continue to be margin driven as well as these new businesses develop as our general merchandize business gets stronger, which helps with mix. It's all of those things. And we always talked about there's so many levers that we can pull at different times when we need to. It's also all those levers that can actually play to our advantage in any given year at any given time.  So I just feel good about the momentum of the business. I'm as -- I said this this morning, I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about the business and the shape of the business model. To answer Q4 specifically, there's a couple of things. There's some holiday timing in international. We also had some impacts of some impairments this quarter, some of that was adjusted out. But it's those things, but also the cost. When you look at the supply chain costs and the COVID costs in Q4, that's big change. And we do expect some abatement of costs over the year. When that happens how that happens, obviously is to be seen. But it\u2019s those things that help that Quarter4 operating income. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Your customer base looks a lot like the overall U.S. consumer. There is a lot of concern around the low to mid-income consumer. The outlook for that consumer this year, given the stimulus lap, the inflation and other uncertainties. How did you factor all of that in as you were planning the year ahead? You probably could have gotten away with guiding to something less than your algorithm excluding divestitures. So is there a risk that you have a recently bias where the business in January was good. And hopefully, this doesn't come across as snarky, but do you think you have more visibility into the macro than the investment community or others? There's just a lot of uncertainty out there right now. Doug McMillon : Michael, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to the 4 and greater than 4, what we told you a year ago was that, that is something we believe we can deliver or beat overtime. And as Brett told you, when we made that commitment and shared those numbers, there are going to be time periods that are higher and time periods that are lower. But overtime, we think that's a really sound set of numbers to share. And we thought it was important to repeat that because we still have that confidence.  And we have that confidence because of all the pieces that we've been talking about. The strategy is coming to life, the business model is changing. As it relates to this year in particular, we've got opportunities to improve in-stock, we've got opportunities to improve store and club standards because of what happened with COVID leave. There's just -- there's upside. And there will definitely be challenges. We know that for sure. But we just have these different opportunities to make choices to deliver the results. And we believe that it was important to repeat the number. John Furner : Something that Doug said is really important about improvement. One of the most fun parts of working at Walmart is having such a large team just every day get up and try to be better than they've been and run a better business. And I've enjoyed that for almost 30 years. But one of the things that's really important in your question is, as we serve really all income groups across all geographies in the U.S. and last year, we saw growth amongst income groups and geographies. So I think that's a clear reflection of the number of choices that we offer customers. We offer customers experience through Walmart.com and e-commerce. We offer customers pickup experiences, we offer in-store and just about everything in between, including home delivery, which will expand to a significant number of households up to 30 million households this year. So I think our ability to serve all across is quite important going forward. And for the team this year, we'll be really focused on execution. I know Sam's would say exactly the same thing, but across the geographies and income, we're well represented. And we're going to fight really hard to deliver great execution for customers all across the year. Doug McMillon : And Michael, you started by saying that the Walmart U.S. customer looks like the U.S. population, and it does to a really large degree. And so we'll serve everybody. And during periods of inflation like this, middle income families, lower middle income families, even wealthier families become more price sensitive. And that's to our advantage. So we've been through this before. And we run with inflation around the world all the time. Inflation is a different environment in the U.S. right now than it has been in recent times for sure, but we\u2019ve been dealing with inflation in South America and Mexico and other places and just to kind of understand what that looks like. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You had mentioned improving in-stocks throughout the year. We were just wondering how you would categorize how Q4 ended up from an in-stock level and what areas could still benefit from improved inventory. And can you talk about any sequential improvements you made in the supply chain and how you view the cadence of the supply and challenges throughout the rest of '22. John Furner : Good morning, Kate. This is John. Let me talk about Q4, and then I'll come back to the supply chain. I think in general, we were seeing really nice improvements in in-stock late in Q3, early Q4. We're happy with how the holiday season turned out, including the ability to deliver seasonal and hard lines across the quarter which you saw.  A couple of strengths that really stood out were the apparel business and our Health & Wellness business were both strong throughout the quarter. Those resulted -- due to demand, those resulted in pretty decent sell throughs. And then in January, with the effects of Omicron we took a step back in in-store in-stock and the line.  But what we're seeing right now is better flow through all across the supply chain. You heard the increase in inventory, a large reflection of what is inbound. So we see recovery is pretty quick. There are a couple of categories in the store that you'll see some out of stocks that are really national issues.  And as far as the supply chain, we talked about it in Q3. There were some significant improvements in flow through at ports, changing lead times, getting containers moved into the country and that's all helped. But just a reminder, about two thirds of what we sell is manufactured or assembled here in the United States. And we see growth across those categories as well. So I think we\u2019ll see much flow in the next few weeks and months and get us into a really good position as we lean into the first and second quarters. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Grom : Hey, good morning. Congrats on a great year and hats off Brett on a wonderful career at Walmart. My question is on the consumer again. And I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any noticeable changes in spending patterns by income cohorts in light of inflation, a lap of the stimulus. You talked about January being the best on a two-year basis, but just wondering if you could unpack it a little bit by income level. John Furner : Hey, Chuck. This is John. I also echo congrats to Brett on a great career. Thanks for mentioning that. Doug McMillon : He's not done yet. Brett Biggs : I'm chill on that. John Furner : But definitely he has made a nice impact. Chuck, a couple of things. We said a second ago, we do serve the country broadly, we see the ability to serve all income groups. And things like private brand versus brand, we don't really see this point. We see really strong demand. Private brand penetration is about flat.  So at this point, we see really strong demand and the customer who's in good shape with a strong balance sheet. So we're optimistic that the inventory pull-throughs that we have done and have in transit will get us in great position to be able to serve customers as we get into this fiscal year. Brett Biggs : Thanks for the sentiment, Chuck. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. And I'll add my congratulations to you, Brett. Just two questions. One, I guess, similar question, maybe that's been tried to ask. But there are some concerns going into the quarter about whether or not you could maintain this kind of earnings growth algorithm against strong results in 2021. And so maybe just can you help us understand the underlying factors that enable you to grow on this higher base.  You talked a little bit about Connect and the advertising business. Is there just underlying progress in eCommerce profitability? I know we don't talk about it the same way anymore, but just what do you think are those underlying drivers that helped you maintain this level of growth? Doug McMillon : Okay. Kelly, we all want to answer that. So the business model, the income statement is just changing shape. And I think that kind of the headlines are the company is becoming more digital. It is starting to become more automated and overtime will become even more automated.  And when you look at the gross margin number, we can manage it. Now some of you like to watch gross margin as, I guess makes sense quarter-to-quarter. As Brett was reminding us yesterday, you can drive yourself crazy doing that. Gross margin overtime -- I mean, look at our track record. We can manage gross margin.  Now then below gross margin, we've got productivity opportunities and technology, whether it's an app in a store for an associate on the sales floor or robotics in a distribution center creates an opportunity for productivity overtime. That is helpful.  And then you get to these other businesses like the advertising business, the last mile delivery business, fulfillment services for eCommerce, the marketplace itself. And these are helpful businesses from a margin point of view. And as they become a larger percent of total, the shape of the income statement changes. And our confidence in that, not only in the U.S. but around the world in the markets we operate in is high. And so that's why you sense that confidence from us. Brett, do you want to go next? Brett Biggs : You said it well. John, do you want to address that? John Furner : And I'll just add a couple of things there. First, having digital relationships with customers is so important. More and more, we fulfill from stores to stores -- our stores but they also act as fulfillment centers, as we said earlier. So this ability to interact with customers digitally is important. Our workforce is becoming more digital.  You got over a million associates who have a device in their hands from the minute they walk in until they leave, so that's saving them time. And then finally, I'll just reiterate what Doug mentioned is automation and supply chain and using automation to augment the things that our associates don't want to spend as much time doing so they can spend the time on the things that are value added, like in-stock and availability.  And I'll just close by saying our optimism and improvements this year is we've got a lot of room to improve in in-stock and customer ability that we've seen over the last couple of years. We're really proud of the growth. We know we could have done a lot more had we had the inventory position at the right time and the right place. So I'm really optimistic that there is upside on the top line. Doug McMillon : You mentioned e-commerce. We're continuing to manage contribution profit with e-commerce business as a standalone vertical. And apparel and home are important, and we've seen growth there over the last couple of years. And then the marketplace helps. The marketplace has been scaling faster, as you can see in the $170 million number. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen : Hi. Thank you. Regarding Walmart investment ecosystem, what are your thoughts on future shopping experiences, particularly as we see consumers really the [technical difficulty] And in your prepared remarks, you spoke about fintech a few times. So it would be great to hear from you how that integrates your broader strategy and the shopping experience, as well as consumerization of health care. You're a great provider of health care in different ways across communities. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Oliver, you covered a lot there, and your voice was breaking up a bit. But we think we got it. On the future of shopping, it's really exciting. I mean there are so many things that we can imagine. One of our challenges is just setting priorities and not trying to do too much. But we've got, obviously, a great strength in stores, and I think that that's clear.  The pickup business has been terrific in the U.S. for many years now. Delivery is growing around the world. This delivery that's happening that's unattended is exciting and this Walmart InHome business, which leads towards just keeping people in stock and they don't have to really think about buying the items they buy all the time and we then use that data to serve up impulse items will be part of that future. We do think that social commerce around the world and what happens with wearables and AR and mixed reality will be part of our future. And we're obviously thinking about that and working on that. And this key, as I mentioned in my remarks, of stitching it together whether it's fintech or health care. And John, you should jump in on future shopping, fintech and health care, too. The way you stitch that together so that one business becomes a default for the other is the magic of it. I mean if we can really become great from a financial services point of view, we can take out friction and cost for customers, make it more delightful to transact with us. Not even really think about transacting, John, as we've changed shopping experience as it relates to checkouts in the future as well as on our app and in other digital forms. John Furner : Yeah. Oliver, on the consumer, I'll just start there. I see the way Doug is very excited to see some of the changes because the consumer, which historically in the past, you might have thought of as the consumer fits in the segment, consumers segment, depending on the day or the week or the hour of the day. Consumers sometimes need things right away, which we can do in under two hours of express delivery. They may need a pickup order in a couple of days, and they may need something for our kids\u2019 birthday party this weekend. And we can work with all of those. And that's really exciting. On fintech and health care, specifically those are on our flywheel for important reasons. One, in fintech, we're excited about the potential acquisitions that we mentioned pending regulatory approval. But we're looking for modern innovative ways to offer customers the ability to access affordable financial solutions and financial products. Because considerable number of customers, including middle income customers, are underserved when it comes to financial services. And we believe that we have a role that can help there and we get it in a way that's digital. And then just going on to Health & Wellness, it's a big question with all these things that you have in there. But the health business was our fastest-growing comp business in Q4. We are excited about continuing to be able to serve customers at the pharmacy. Our pharmacists and pharmacy techs have done a tremendous job this last year in serving customers.  And we're seeing with the addition of things like our telehealth company and other services, the ability for our pharmacists and tech to practice at the top of their licenses and really help customers live better. So you put all this together, all of these opportunities really do position the company to live through its purpose. And that\u2019s to help customers money so they can live better in the combination of retail, financial services and health and wellness do that really well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Ben Bienvenu : Thanks. Good morning. There's been a lot of great questions asked, so I want to ask a more specific one. You mentioned some places to roll back prices. I'm curious, is that because you see less inflation in those categories? I suspect not. Or is it because you see the opportunity for that to really resonate with the consumer? And within that idea, are there categories, places where you're seeing a change in consumer behavior, whether it's trading down or a unique opportunity for you all? John Furner : Hey, Ben. It's John. Thanks for the question. On the rollback, this is all about making sure the customers see value. At a time when prices are rising in so many parts of the economy, being able to offer customer value and find inflation is what we do. It's what our merchants do. And that will continue. As I said earlier, the counter rollbacks today is up pretty significantly from the end of the third quarter and about to where it was at the end of the first quarter last year. So I'd say I was just -- I was in the store across the street early this morning, and we've got rollbacks in consumer electronics and parts of dry grocery. And those values really matter as customers become more concerned and they think more about inflationary pressures.  So we'll continue to be an everyday low price retailer. That\u2019s our platform. We want to offer great values with price gaps to deliver for shareholders as well each and every day that we operate. But we\u2019ll make sure that customers see value in key categories as we get into this year. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, everyone. I guess a bit of a follow-up on that question. As you guys hold down prices despite higher procurement costs to drive price gaps, are you seeing any kind of competitive response? Or do you find you're almost competing against yourself because other companies just can't hold down prices the way you can? Doug McMillon : Good. Around the world, Scot, retailers are all having to manage this. And we talk about price gaps, our price leadership position for a reason because prices are relative and it's more fluid in an inflationary environment like this. So we have to spend more of our time paying attention to that. We do mix across categories. We think about things like opening price points and protecting for a lower income family some of the things that they need from a staples point of view.  And then as John mentioned, we use rollbacks to communicate not only the reality of prices are coming down at some places, but the emotion or perception we want customers to have about us being there for them and earning their trust during a period of time like this. So I wouldn't say that we're unique in having to work through that. Of course, everybody is. But we are likely a bit unique with the depth of experience that we have and the talent of our team to be able to manage it and our longstanding supplier relationships and the way we work with them to try and help them get through the situation as well. The amount of communication between us and suppliers is always high. It's particularly high right now. John Furner : It is -- I just refer to things that we said in the past. A merchant here has so many levers between mix in categories, what they feature on the home page this morning at the top of the home page is a section on rollbacks. They can change that, they can change modes, they can change features. There are just so many things that they can do to manage mix overtime that it puts our team into a good position to do this.  We've got experienced people who know how to do this. And we have a number of associates here in the U.S. have worked in other markets where inflation is quite common, and that's really been helpful this last year to have that expertise inside the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to take a shot at some of the comp questions that have been asked prior. You talked about 1% and 2% in the U.S. in the first quarter, sort of 3% in 2Q and 3Q. That would suggest you accelerate roughly 4 in the fourth quarter. So I guess my question is you'll be going again sort of peak food-at-home inflation, some elevated SAP benefits.  So I want to get into like sort of how you're thinking about getting there? Do you expect any deflation to occur expect share gains in grocery to accelerate as some of your customer base sort of seeks out more value? And then embedded in that, is that -- is there accelerated growth in general merchandize as you fill out the assortment and the fulfillment options? John Furner : Hey, Christopher. Add a -- say a couple of things regarding the question. A lot of the phasing that are in the forecast definitely include strong customer demand. They include better inventory positions. We talked about inventory in total being up 28% with a considerable amount of that, that is in transit on the way, which does include general merchandize. But also has a reflection of what we believe would be better in-stock positions in food and consumables.  Now the quarterly phasing also has the lapping of stimulus last year. In the month we're in, we had a large ice storm last year in Texas. And then in the months of March and April, we had stimulus that was significant. So it does reflect that across the quarters. And I don't think I'd add anything else to that. Brett, unless you have anything. Brett Biggs : No, I'd say, Chris, as you can imagine, the quarterly phasing is more challenging than normal just given the comparisons that we're up against. But I think, as John said, there's a number of different things during the year that make us feel confident in the total year. And we've given you as good as we feel like we can today and where we think it will stack up for the quarters. But there's going to be some quarterly variability certainly during the year. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : Thanks again for your time and attention. I'd just summarize by saying it's great to have momentum in all three segments as we start this year. I think it's clear that we're changing to serve customers and members in the way that they want to be served and having stores and in eCommerce business, pick up, delivery, fulfillment centers and marketplace, all of those things are helpful as it relates to that.  And the great thing about it is the way that we\u2019re building these and designing them is that the company can grow earnings and grow the bottom line while we\u2019re doing it. The business model changes and it enables the customer, a member to benefit and our business to benefit at the same time. So I\u2019m excited about the short-term momentum and looking forward to the year. Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Dan Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to Walmart's first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam's Club. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you an update on the business and discuss first-quarter results. That will be followed by our question and answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning. Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top-line point of view. Sales for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The Bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to three areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's club. Each of these items represents about a third of our overall profit miss. The first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition. The second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1 resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher cost for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year. The third item is related to fuel costs in our supply chain. So those are the three items and I'll now share more detail on each to help provide clarity. As for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron curve to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top-line performance. As it relates to Walmart U.S. General Merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected, as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters. We started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted. We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels, and pricing while also managing our price gaps. While we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level, and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items, while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs. Importantly, we expect the solid top-line performance to continue and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top-line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the international segment had another good quarter. We're making progress in executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members, and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top-line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today. Globally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses. As we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth and fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart Ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000, including Exxon and Mobil stations. Our health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of four new locations and more and more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com, is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app, which is available on low bandwidths, so it's usable for more people in more cities. And in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than a 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in the space. I also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet Cashi. In the U.S. through our JV with Ribbit Capital, we completed the acquisitions of two fintech businesses, One Finance and Even, and combined those businesses under the ONE brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally, and help them strengthen their lives financially. Now I'll briefly comment on each segment before Brett adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan and we continue to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience when people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, e-commerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the e-commerce experiences as in-stock improves and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience, and delivery accuracy and speed. Our e-commerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put a strain on our system, however, the team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill e-commerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers. Moving to Sam's Club U.S., we continue to drive strong comp sales on a one and two-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw good growth in e-commerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier. Walmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in e-commerce. I visited our teams in stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. The progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and healthcare that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. I also like the example from Mexico where we have a MXN200 per month unlimited Internet option, it's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3 times that price. In summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future. Thank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our Annual Associate and Shareholder Celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors, and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment, and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner. With that, I give you Mr. Biggs. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Doug. In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges, as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than two years and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time. Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2n reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging periods yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased cost, and persistently high inflation. There are some things that were unique to the first quarter like some labor scheduling inefficiencies as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance to start the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along, more effectively. The costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will strike some into Q2, but the scheduling-related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock, and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically. Our market position is strong and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature. Our expectations for the top and bottom-line growth algorithm remain structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress in building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engage with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships. Now, let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong topline results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6% reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco. First-quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year, due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation of markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel, and e-commerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China, led to increased challenges. While sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables as spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather such as apparel, patio furniture, and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving led to higher than normal markdowns for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2. SG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor cost at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30. Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income, and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year. Now let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel grew 3% and we're up 9% on two-year stack, reflecting strong food sales which were up low-double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high-single digits on a two-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. E-commerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores. We're making strong progress in many of our newer higher margin initiatives, the Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter over quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform. We also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held the grand openings of four new Walmart health centers in Florida and we'll open another one next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care. One, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital closed in the One Finance and Even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters. International sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency with Mexico and Canada leading the way. E-commerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a two-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9% with strong growth in stores as well as e-commerce sales which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a two-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were up 7.7%, while in China growth was slower than expected but comp still increased more than 4% led by e-commerce growth of nearly 90%. Flipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers, such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto, and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher e-commerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in e-commerce across the portfolio. Sam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6% excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a two-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. E-commerce sales grew 22%, membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure, I mentioned previously, was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit, and expense leverage. Now let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter end of the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance. Based on our continuing strong topline, we feel good about our ability to deliver full-year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth excluding divestitures to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance of more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year on year. As our usual practice, we will update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including c of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds on our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up. In closing, I'm pleased with the top-line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders. Now we'd be happy to open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. I have one question and one follow-up. My first question is on the health of the consumer. Curious what your assessment is if the consumer is getting marginally weaker, staying about the same? You mentioned there were some mix shifts in your quarter, but you also said that you're adjusting pricing and you raised your sales guidance. So it would seem that maybe the consumer isn't getting weaker? Doug McMillon : Hi, Simeon, this is Doug. And John or Brett may want to add some color too. I think it's important to recognize that there's more than one consumer. We serve the whole country. I assume you're talking about the U.S. in particular. So we've got a breadth of customers and they behave differently. As we said in our prerecorded remarks, for some customers, we are seeing some indications of change throughout the quarter, but that's not true for all of them. John Furner : Hi, Simeon. Good morning. It's John. Just to reiterate what Doug said, we do serve a wide range of customers and certainly have seen strength in the consumer. We see growth in high-ticket items like game consoles recently with warmer weather, strength in patio furniture, grills, gardening, and hardlines, but we do see some consumers switching. We see categories like deli, lunch meat, bacon, dairy, where we see customers trading from brands to private brands. So we see both of those things happening at the same time. But as we reported strong topline results, we see a wide range of consumer behavior. Simeon Gutman : And maybe the follow-up regarding the guidance change and what happened in Q1. In Q4, the business created this perception that it was being managed pretty agile, you were able to adapt to higher costs and you raised price. Was it in the first quarter that costs were up too quick or that you were hesitant to move price to the degree that you did in the fourth quarter? There was just such a divergence from how you managed Q4 to Q1, albeit not that you manage it that finally every quarter. So that's what created the surprise, I think, to us in in the profit miss. Doug McMillon : Yes, Simeon, it's more about the speed than it is the other issue. Things moved quickly in the back half of the quarter. And as you mentioned, it sometimes creates a timing issue. So life doesn't begin and end with the quarter dates beginning and end, and we'll manage this as we go through the year. But the mindset and the ability of the management haven't changed. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question will be coming from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to just ask a little bit about the inventory. And I ask in the context of how much you fully factored in the risk that the consumer further weakens. And therefore, in that context, how much ability going forward do you have to flex the P&L with respect to sort of manage, I guess, the P&L with respect to further markdowns, gross margin risk in the U.S. given your high levels of inventory, but also contemplating the risk of further SG&A deleverage if there is more weakening with the consumer? Thank you. John Furner : Sure. Hi, Karen, it's John. First, just to reiterate, strong top line in the first quarter and our guidance on top line that would reflect our confidence that there will be strength in the top line. As you look at what happened in Q1 specifically, we did take on more inventory, but we've seen strength as of recently in general merchandise, given the warmer weather, we have a large number of rollbacks that are present right now, and the customer is responding to both very well. As I said, we have strength in high-ticket items, like durables and hardlines and then we do see some switching. On inventory, and particularly, we're up about 33% and the vast majority of that increase is a reflection of both inflation and inventory positioning that improves availability quarter-to-quarter, which we're happy with. And then we have some inventory, the remaining portion of the increase that we'll have to work through and sell through over the next couple of quarters. Brett Biggs : Yes. Karen, it's Brett. I feel good about the timeliness of how we're handling inventory with rollbacks. The way we're looking at pricing, as we said in our prepared remarks, I think over the next quarter or two, we'll work our way through this, but I feel good about the way we're going to manage through this. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Bob Drbul : Good morning and Brett, congratulations, going to miss you. Thanks for everything. On - my question would be, can you talk about just conversations with your vendors, given their strong results, are you leaning in more on negotiations? Can you just sort of help us understand your mindset at this point? Thanks. John Furner : Hi, Bob, I'll take it. It's John. As we said, we definitely have seen an inventory increase. A large portion of that was planned. But certainly, the way we feel about it, given some of the switching and other things that I mentioned earlier, I mentioned categories like deli, lunchmeat, dairy, bacon, where we see switching. Our team and our suppliers need to do everything we can do to keep costs low so that we could have values for customers that are meaningful. That's the purpose of the company. We're positioned to do well in great economies and economies that aren't as good. So we're going to be positioning ourselves well to take care of our customers going forward and our teams and our suppliers, we both need to do more to help customers out. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Steph Wissink : Hi. Good morning, everyone. We have a follow-up question on just what you're seeing or what you have seen throughout the course of the quarter. Any material change in the consumer basket that you think is notable? I know you called out mix shift towards grocery. But any signs that the consumer as the quarter progressed, reacted differently than you expected? Thank you. John Furner : Yes. So on the basket, in the first quarter, we definitely had an impact due to the offsetting of stimulus from last year. We had a very strong quarter last year, one of the strongest quarters we've ever had. So expected an impact in general merchandise as we went into the quarter. And we did see increased strengthening in food as the quarter went along and then late in the quarter and then to the beginning of the month of May, we've seen strengthening in general merchandise. I think it's a combination of warmer weather across the country and the response to the rollbacks that we put in place. In terms of the consumer themselves, we've seen strong growth with higher income consumers, middle income, and lower income, but we do see a definite strength with high-ticket items, as I said, with some consumers than others, we do see some switching, which would include switching specifically from brands to private brands. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Thanks. My question was really about what's driving the basket and working down the inventory. So it's one question. But I guess if we look at this quarter, is there a way to say how much was inflation and mix? I think you mentioned units were down. Could you give us a number to that? And then really on inventories, just should we expect $100 million of markdowns in the next couple of quarters? How do we think about that cadence? John Furner : Greg, on the basket, first of all, what we're seeing right now is an increase in traffic and ticket. We did see units per basket slightly lower in first quarter. We think that's a combination of some of the switching that we mentioned earlier, but also the offset of stimulus from last year. We had significant strength in categories that were affected by stimulus. As far as the inventory positioning, the growth in the U.S., specifically about 33%, as I said earlier, the vast majority of that is inflation plus the improvements in availability that we have prepared for and intentionally purchase over the last few quarters. And then as I said, there is a portion of the inventory that we'll need the next quarter or two to work through. Customers are responding very well to the rollbacks. We began those late in apparel in the third - for the first quarter and then extended more rollbacks into the second, and we're seeing a good response from both of those. So we think that over the next quarter or two, we'll sell through the remaining inventory, the increase that we have on the books right now, and as you heard from Brett in the prepared remarks, we did raise guidance for the rest of the year on the top line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Brett, congratulations. My question is the cost pressures that Walmart has encountered come from the queue of Amazon facing its own margin pressure. So to what extent are these developments reflective of increased competition between Walmart and Amazon. And does it suggest the cost of doing business is rising as the macro uncertainty increases? And as part of that question, should we assume that if these are just reflective of timing differences that you get all of these costs and margin pressures back in the first and second quarter of next year when you lap them? Thanks a lot. Doug McMillon : Michael, this is Doug. I think it's more about market dynamics than it is relative to competition and I would expect to get these things back over time. As we mentioned earlier, things moved quickly in the back half of the quarter and it just takes a little bit of time to adjust. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're managing things at an item level from a pricing point of view. But below that gross margin line, there were costs related to fuel and then the staffing issue that we mentioned that just need to be resolved, but we see those as being isolated to the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Good morning and congrats, Brett. So my question is just really on the profit guide for the year coming down clearly first quarter and then some in the second. Is it right to view the second-half profit guide largely intact here? Just curious kind of your view on the holidays later this year have changed at all? And if you've adjusted any orders accordingly? Thank you. Brett Biggs : Peter, it's Brett. Appreciate it. Yes, we - when you look at the full-year guidance, the way I would describe it on quarter-to-quarter, I probably go out being known for saying quarter-to-quarter margin is tough to predict. But I feel good about the guidance for the full year. I think if you work down through the profit the P&L statement, there's a lot of variables there and more variables than typical because of what we're doing with an external environment. And you look at a range of outcomes of all those variables. When you add that up, you get to a bottom line and that's what we felt for the full year. How that comes quarter-to-quarter is a little more challenging to see. We gave quarterly guidance for the second quarter. Obviously, that's a little closer in. But for the year, I feel good about the guidance, and that kind of implies where we think we'll be in Q3, Q4. And as we always do as we come out of Q2, we'll update you of how we see the world at that point. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to ask about price gaps in grocery. If you're still happy with where you are with regards to price gaps in light of the level of inflation? And you mentioned trade down to private label, but just curious in terms of maybe trade down from traditional grocery to Walmart Grocery, are you - have you been seeing new customers come into the store? John Furner : Hi Kate, it's John. Let me take the first question. On price gaps, this is, of course, something that we look at every week, every day, and our role with our customers to make sure that customers can find values on everyday goods. I think that my team specifically in our supply base, we need to do more to control costs, to ensure that we can provide great value to retail for our customers. I mentioned a group of categories in proteins and dairy, where definitely see switching as we look at what's happening in the baskets. So I think we have some work to do in terms of ensuring that we're providing the right values and we're going to do that across the second quarter going into the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. I had a follow-up to that last question. So the price architecture across retail has been pretty rational in pretty much every category. Are you seeing any change from the traditional grocers in terms of maybe they're becoming more high-low than they had been in getting back to where they were pre-COVID? And related to - you mentioned rollbacks and being an advocate for the consumer, are the rollbacks focused in seasonal category where the inventory is heavy or is there some rollbacks also occurring on the consumables side of the business? John Furner : We've really seen a strengthening in grocery over the weeks in the quarter. The quarter strengthened on the top line later into the quarter and remained strong early in the month of May, favored by positioning. We're happier with our inventory levels versus where we have been in previous quarters. And then with warmer weather, we've seen a reaction from the consumer in the grocery categories. In terms of the rollbacks, specifically, we position those over 10,000 rollbacks in seasonal and general merchandise categories. I mentioned earlier the inventory level up 33%, about more than half that the majority of that is not only inflation, but it is improvement in availability across the entire network. And then there's a portion of the inventory that the rollbacks and other things that we have in place already will help us sell through over the next couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Robbie Ohmes : Good morning. I want to ask just what you are seeing in the e-commerce outlook from here? Are people shifting back to stores? How should we think about that? And I think you mentioned the global advertising business was up 30%. How was that versus expectations? And how should we think about that going forward as well? John Furner : Yes. In terms of e-commerce, we had about a 1% increase in the first quarter, which is similar to Q4 last year. We definitely had pulled forward in growth over the last year or two given all the stimulus and change in consumer behavior. Stores were strong in the first quarter but what we're seeing so far in the month of May is strength in both channels. So it's like the growth is more evenly spread at least up to this point. On advertising, we're pleased with the performance in the growth in the U.S. market. The Walmart Connect team continue to make progress and grow our advertising business and we feel like that's an exciting part of what we're doing. One of our things that we stay focused on is the reshaping of the business and building a flywheel that will serve customers but also help the company raise income at levels that enable us to lower costs for our customers. Kath McLay : And this is Kathryn, Sam's Club. I - we have been happy to see our e-com growth by 22%, which is a really nice blend of curbside, which we launched 18 months ago and as well as direct-to-home and traffic really strong into the clot at 10%. So really nice blend of members shopping us across all channels. It's due to pay from international similar trends across the international business, really encouraged at looking at some of the two-year e-commerce stacks that we're seeing around the world. So Walmex at 185%two-year stack, China 149%, and Canada 112%. Similar blend, we have seen people coming back into our stores as well. The team are keeping momentum in e-commerce. From an ad tech perspective and advertising revenue, Flipkart in particular, doing a really nice job here in building out that platform and supporting small sellers as well as add business and new revenue streams. So they saw some good growth year-on-year in that, and we're taking a lot of learnings from them in that space as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen. Oliver Chen : Thank you. In the prepared remarks, you called out timing strategy a few times. As we think about timing and managing the inflation relative to what you can do on the top line, I would love to hear more about that in our modeling. And second, just a bigger picture question on Walmart Plus and the flywheel, would love any updates there? It looks like you're making lots of great progress spread as well. Thank you. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Oliver. John Furner : On timing, Oliver, a few things that happened in the quarter that we did mention, of course, there was inflation that came through the quarter in terms of cost of goods, then there was the fuel cost charges that we mentioned that came in at very fast rate, really late February, early March. And then there was the pressure on wages that was really the month of February after the Omicron environment. And for the most part, I feel good about the way we have those costs positioned for now. Of course, it could change given that how dynamic the market is. And then on the entire flywheel Plus is an important piece of the flywheel. When you look at the flywheel and step back, we have the business that's in stores. We have our e-commerce business, including a marketplace. We're making progress in health care and financial services with the acquisitions that we managed to complete and have under the One banner. And then Plus along with Walmart Connect and data ventures are all important pieces of the flywheel. Really pleased with the progress the team has made in terms of growing the pickup business and offering more slots for customers, becoming more flexible and our NPS scores are improving those categories. It's great to see the team make the progress they've made. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to ask on the Walmart - you asked the inflation levels you guys are seeing. Is there any way you can quantify the level of inflation you're seeing across both grocery and GM? And at this point, any signs that maybe some of the inflationary pressures are starting to peak? Doug McMillon : Yes. I'll jump in. I think, John, you can add what you want. But on the food side, we're seeing double-digit inflation and I'm concerned that, that inflation may continue to increase. And then on the GM side, may see that turn faster during the course of the year. So when you look at our inventory numbers, part of what's driving the inventory up as we mentioned earlier, is that food is just inflated. So we'll manage in stock, we'll manage features and food. When you think about the general merchandise side, break that into apparel and hardlines. Apparel, we were appropriately aggressive as we started the year in terms of our inventory levels. And as we mentioned before, we can roll back prices in apparel as we've done and still be helpful from a margin mix point of view and we'll work through that as we go through the second quarter and beyond, if necessary. But the good news is we've got the summer in front of us. I'm not sure they have these issues in March and April and have them later in the season. And then on the hardline side, kind of the same thing. We've got basic side counter in stock that needs to be strong. And on the non-basic goods that we feature, we'll manage those inventory levels, take rollbacks, in some cases, to manage through the total. And as the customer pays more for food, their GM behavior is something that we'll watch closely. We'll not only watch kind of the opening price point and pack size change on the food side for some customers, the move to private brands, but we'll also watch what that means for the general merchandise side of the business. John Furner : Yes, as Doug said, I feel really good about the rollbacks and the right presentations. We see in stores - I've been in stores all over the country. The store is excited about the rollbacks and the customer is responding. The execution has been strong. And as Doug mentioned, with food inflation with the growth we've seen in the first quarter, I'm also concerned about the rate at which prices have risen in the country and our team, our supply base. We need to do more to keep costs low. And where we see the switching from brands to private brands, we'll continue to watch that for a group of customers, but we've got to all work harder to keep prices low for the American consumer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Michael Baker : Yes. Hi. Perfect segue into my question. Just following up on that. I mean there's some countervailing things that I'm hearing and I guess I said there are a lot of different product categories, but you're talking about keeping prices low and rolling back and that's really, I think, always been your mission in inflation environment is to make sure the consumer can still afford basic needs. But then you also were talking about starting - taking - I think you were saying taking more price increases as we go ahead, [indiscernible] up on some of the timing on some price increases. So can you help square those countervailing wins, if you would? Thanks. John Furner : Yes. Happy to talk more about that. When things like cost of goods increase and we make a decision with our supply base, if that's appropriate, then those types of increases do flow through retail pricing. But there were some things in the first quarter that happened very quickly. We mentioned the labor, after the Omicron variant, we had a significant number of people come back where we had been over-scheduling and overstaffing due to leaves, all came back at the same time. The fuel increase that happened so quickly at the end of February, early into March, those kinds of things, along with - we mentioned charges in supply chain and then we had this fire, which our team did a wonderful job, keeping associates safe and getting them out of the building, but we lost those centers, those were costs that came in very quickly that we feel are more isolated in the first quarter and some of those costs did not flow through because we believe they were short term in nature. So we'll continue to flow what we need to flow at the right timing. But Brett said something earlier that's really important. It's very difficult in an environment that's had so many dynamic changes to manage the margins quarter-to-quarter. Over the longer term, our team is very capable of managing this quarter, and we've done that for a long time, but not all the costs and changes happen when the quarter begins and when the quarter ends. Doug McMillon : One of the more fun and interesting parts of retail is the management of margin and blending the portfolio of items. And I always remember one of my first buying responsibilities was in food and the leader in our area, talked to us, this is quite a long time ago, about profit for the month or profit for the quarter and that we needed to raise profitability. And so, we asked the buyers, I was one of them, to come back with a plan on what prices we were going to reduce by the end of the day. And I paused for a second and thought, we're going to raise profit by reducing prices because that was pretty new, a rookie, but it's really cool to go back and look at which items may be elastic that have above-average margins, bring those prices down to make yourself up. So part of what's at play here is you've got food inflation moving up, but we've got general merchandise categories like apparel and some of our hardlines categories to play with. And the beauty of it is customers are even more price sensitive right now, they're attention, fuel prices are high food prices are high. And so when you bring something down in sporting goods or hardware, one of these other categories, they noticed even more than they would notice before, and that makes the elasticity impact be different than it would be otherwise, which blends the mix up. So we basically end up with a bunch of buyers that are portfolio managers. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thanks. As a follow-up to that anecdote, isn't that also saying that really, there's not much you need to do on food prices that the consumer seems to be absorbing those higher food prices very well, shifting more of their spending to food instead of gen merch. So how aggressive do you think you really need to be on food pricing and private label in this environment? It sounds like you want to focus more on the pricing in general merch? Doug McMillon : We'll manage both. I mean, price gaps matter, and we know where to put our price gap to grow profitable growth. So we'll manage both actively. And we do want customers to have lower prices on food, and we want to sell more general merchandise. And so, we'll partner with the suppliers on the food and consumable side to try and bring those costs down. The lead times in many general merchandise categories are longer. So Peter asked earlier about the fourth quarter, obviously, we're thinking about units by category right now. But as we make those unit decisions, many of those are inflated in some ways. So you're managing dollars at the same time you're managing units to get an outcome and we'll actively manage both sides of it. John Furner : And we want to ensure that we manage the customer message as an average. We serve a lot of customers and different customers are in different places, and we want to be thoughtful about customers all across the country and in different geographies, ensuring that all customers can get the value that expect from shopping with Walmart. Doug McMillon : Not all of them can't afford to absorb this, that's where they need our help. And so we do, as we mentioned earlier, stay focused on opening price point food items, a lot for bread, a gallon of milk, a can of tuna, mac & cheese, protein categories. Are we helping a family that's at the lower end of the income scale, be able to afford to feed their families during this inflationary time. And given that stimulus checks happened last year, there was some benefit to some of those folks that is eroding over time. And as we look at the rest of the year, that's something that's on our mind. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Brett, congrats again. Just on the digital side, up 1%. You talked about some capacity issues. Can you talk about that and flesh it out a little bit? And how we should think about the trajectory of digital sales over the next couple of quarters? John Furner : Hi, Chuck, it's John. Good morning. As we said, the growth rate in Q1 was 1%, same as the fourth quarter. As far as capacity, what happened in Indianapolis was a tough event for the team to go through. Our team did a great job of keeping people safe, everyone was out of the building in less than 5 minutes, but the building was a loss. It was a large fulfillment center in our network. The positive out of that is we have a lot of stores and we have other fulfillment centers and went that about 72 hours. The team was able to reroute the majority of the orders into other places in the country. There are certainly some logistics costs with doing so because it was such a big center, but they moved relatively quickly. There was some topline impact, as you can imagine in each of these centers, particularly with our assortment, including our fulfillment services, there are unique items that are in each of those facilities. And as Doug said, just like our lead times are long in general merchandise so are that of our suppliers and our sellers. So there's some impact there. But looking at the business most recently, as we talked about with Walmart Connect and other parts of commerce, now that we're into the second quarter, early signs of May are given some of the increases in temperature, the seasonal categories have really taken off and that would include walmart.com and our e-commerce business. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Lashway with Citi. Paul Lashway : Thanks, guys. You mentioned less gross margin pressure in 2Q versus 1Q I believe. I'm curious if you would expect that sequential improvement to continue in each quarter for the remainder of the year? And related to that, I'm just curious what sort of impact did you see from your higher-margin growth businesses this quarter? And do you expect those businesses to have a more material positive impact as we move through the year? Thanks. John Furner : I think on margins in Q2 versus Q1 and we still have this issue where we've got to make sure we're doing everything we can with our suppliers to manage our costs so that we can keep food pricing in a great spot for our consumers. We think about our price gaps every day. We talk about it every day, every week, and we manage those carefully. And what we need to do is work together with our supply base in categories like we mentioned, in proteins and dairy, where we see some switching from brands to private brands. And we see switching from gallons of milk to half gallons of milk as said this morning. We've got to do what we can in those categories to keep costs low. Doug McMillon : I think the biggest issue as it relates to gross margin Q2 through Q4 will be mixed. And we didn't have favorable weather in the first quarter as the temperatures warmed up, we saw stronger sales in GM, apparel included. And so one of the reasons why we mentioned that Q2 looks like it will have less pressures that we think the mix will be different in Q2 than it was in Q1. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : Good morning. And Brett, I'll add my congratulations. Thanks for everything over the years. Brett Biggs : Thanks, Ben. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask with the start to 2Q, where do you feel like you have the best handle on the business, what are the biggest challenges you're still seeing? And then you noted your goal for the remainder of the year is to get back to your original guidance. How are you going to achieve that goal? How do you think you're most likely to do that? Doug McMillon : Let's go back to Paul for just a second. I think we missed the second half of his question and then we'll come back. He asked about the higher-margin growth businesses like Walmart Connect and whether we expect those to continue to grow. We shared that Q1 was up about 30%. Those ancillary businesses in the U.S. and around the world are growing, and we expect that to continue. And we're excited about that. Frankly, when I look at the Q1 results, I understand the response to a miss, but I hope that some of the underlying improvement that's happening and the shaping that's taking place with the business model isn't totally lost on people because I think that's going to continue, and it will result in a company that's more resilient and more diversified on the bottom line. John Furner : And on the mix as far as where we are now, really good improvements since late in Q1, we mentioned the rollbacks in apparel those are high-margin businesses that are accretive to the total. So the rollbacks there. The rollbacks still help the business in terms of sales and margin. And then really, really pleased with the results in commerce, in stores regarding seasonal merchandise and what we're seeing as we get into the second quarter now that we've got some warmer weather it looks really strong from our view. Doug McMillon : And Ben, you asked about the comment - I made the comment about being focused still on our original guidance. And I think that's the statement to what I see inside the company, what I've always known the company be high sense of urgency, really smart people able to work on - in any kind of challenge. We've seen that over the last 2.5 years. I think we've managed incredibly well in the last 2.5 years. So we're still focused on what we said at the first of the year, but felt it appropriate to reduce the guidance officially based on the first quarter. But it's one quarter to the year and there's still a lot of leverage to pull. So that's why I made that comment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. So the last time we saw consumer weakness in greater private label concentration, it's starting to become self-fulfilling, meaning consumers were focusing on private label and so you provide more shelf space to private label, which drove more private label sales, so on and so forth. So when you look at today's environment and the price increases vendors are trying to pass on, should we expect private label mix to continue to increase in the coming quarters? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Yes, I wouldn't want to see us adjust shelf allocation much. This is more about just staying in stock and letting the customer decide. John Furner : Yes. We have - I have exactly the same way. We serve a broad range of consumers and we serve in different places. We serve customers in the store, we serve them at the curve, they pick up. We serve them in their home in their refrigerator and we deliver direct. So I think we just have such a broad range of offering that we can serve all consumers well. And if customers buy one item more than the other, we'll replenish it that way. But I see us staying in a position to be able to serve a wide range of consumers. Operator : At this time, we've reached the end of our question and answer session. And I will turn the call back to Dan McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : It's Doug McMillon. There are a lot of Dans around here though. Operator : Sorry about that. Doug McMillon : No problem. No problem. I'll start by thanking Brett, and Brett has done an outstanding job for a lot of years all over the company. He's been a great partner, not just to me, but to all of us. His judgment, his character, his knowledge of the company, just who he is as a person, it's a great accomplishment to become the CFO of Walmart and you've done a great job, and we're going to miss you. And I wish we'd gone out on a great quarter and it still very tune you in that way. So you can chime in from the cheap seats when things get better. Speaking of things getting better, we're motivated to have a really strong year. I mean we are understanding the environment, trying to convey to you all what we see going forward. But we expect customers and members to come our way. We're going to keep growing overall. We're going to keep growing our share, and we're going to change the business model of the company to be more profitable. And there were some things that happened during the quarter that were different than what we expected, and we're trying to be very transparent about those things. And then with performance, earn your trust and just keep moving forward and make this as isolated of an issue as we can. There is a lot of uncertainty looking forward. Things are very fluid. I know you all are gathering information every day and so are we. And as I talk to people across the country and across the world, there seems to be more uncertainty now in a very fluid environment. And so we'll just - we'll deal with that. And we like the hand that we've got to play. We've got a great set of assets, we've got a great set of people, and when things are more difficult, we should outperform. And so our first-quarter performance is a disappointment to us, and we're going to put it behind us and have a strong year. Looking forward to seeing you in person, those of you that can make it to the meeting on June 3, we'll be down at Fayetteville, and we're going to have a bunch of associates and kind of get back to pre-pandemic type week, which we're all excited about and we hope to see you there. Thank you all. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Dan Binder, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Dan, you may begin. Dan Binder : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to Walmart\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. I am joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, CEO; John David Rainey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. In a few moments, Doug and John David will provide you an update on the business and discuss second quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today\u2019s call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning and thanks for joining us. A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year. The second quarter finished stronger than we had anticipated and John David will touch on that in a moment and provide more detail for the back half of the year. Our sales were well ahead of plan, with inflation lifting our average transaction size, but we know that the amount and persistence of inflation is negatively affecting many families. From the U.S. to Mexico to Canada to Chile, they are prioritizing how they spend their money. We are pleased to see more families from a variety of income levels choose us as they look for value. Our purpose is to save people money and help them live better and that\u2019s especially important right now. After the first quarter, we shared how the environment had changed. The cost of food and fuel, a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables, and excess inventory in general merchandise categories were among the most challenging items for us at the time. As we move through Q2, food inflation continued to tick up and we continued to see a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables in many of our markets and that put pressure on margins overall. Food comps in the U.S. were up mid-teens for the quarter, with units in food slightly negative and about flat exiting the quarter even with double-digit inflation. Another weight on margins has been the number of markdowns we have taken. Starting back in March, we knew we needed to act quickly and aggressively in some categories and we have. We have made good progress to reduce inventory levels where we focused and taken markdowns. The aggressive approach we took to move through apparel in particular put financial pressure on us, but it helped relieve pressure on our stores and through our supply chain. We are making good progress to reduce costs. We have reduced the number of shipping containers in our system, for example, by more than half from the Q1 level and are now much closer to our historical averages. We are also managing pricing to reflect our fully landed costs. The merchants are adjusting by category to reflect where we expect demand to be. We had our U.S. store manager meeting last week and amongst other topics, we shared examples of items where we are holding prices down or rolling them back. Those tend to be opening price point, private brand, food and consumables items. We want to help families put meals on the table with great value in our other private brands to relieve the pressure they are feeling. The quality, value and convenience we offer, makes Walmart a smart choice and we are seeing more middle and higher income shoppers choose us. As I have been in U.S. stores recently, I am pleased how we have executed back-to-school. As we finish it off in some markets, we have transitioned to back to college in the appropriate stores with items like mini refrigerators, floor-length mirrors and futons. In July, I got to visit our associates in India. After visits to Flipkart, Myntra and PhonePe, a Flipkart fulfillment center and a Kirana to see how they are using PhonePe, I left even more excited about what\u2019s happening in these businesses and what\u2019s to come. Having visited several of our international markets this year, I am pleased by how connected we are now and how so much of what we are building is common across markets as we scale marketplace businesses and fulfillment advertising and financial services and take steps to make a bigger difference in healthcare. As I look ahead, I expect a strong finish to the back-to-school season and we will quickly transition to the holidays. Our fall and holiday products look great. There is a lot of newness and we have got a strong position in opening price points across categories. From Halloween to Christmas to Flipkart\u2019s Big Billion Days, we will be ready. We will have a cleaner inventory position and we will have a strong seasonal presence. We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make and we are adjusting to that reality so we can help them more. Regardless of the inflation level and as we work through the places we have too much inventory, we continue to make progress on our strategy. We are becoming more digital, even more relevant as an omnichannel retailer and the related businesses, like fulfillment and advertising, continue to grow. We are building a different business and we are making progress. Let\u2019s move on to our operating segments. I\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S. The strong comps we see in food and consumables are leading to market share gains. Pickup and delivery are strong. Growth is improving on Walmart.com, including the marketplace and more people are choosing to be a Walmart+ member or step up to in-home. Walmart+ is an important component of our plan and we announced the addition of a streaming benefit. Walmart+ members will receive a Paramount+ subscription at no additional cost as part of their Walmart+ membership in September. The premium streaming service offers a broad content offering with original series, movies, family shows and live sports. We are excited about the coming launch and we know our members will be, too. Beyond membership, the team is also working on getting items to customers faster, while lowering the cost of delivery through a significant increase in the number of orders fulfilled by stores. We have increased this volume by nearly 40% from a year ago. Speed matters, whether it\u2019s how quickly we get items to customers or how quickly we scale new businesses. Our white label delivery platform service, Walmart Go Local, will celebrate its 1 year anniversary later this month. Powered by our Spark Driver platform, I am excited about the growth I have seen so far and the expectations looking ahead. We passed 1 million deliveries so far with Go Local. We expect to have about 5,000 pickup locations by year end and client satisfaction scores are strong. We continue to sign up larger scale customers and we are making strides on the bigger unlock, which are small and medium-sized businesses. Our technology and expertise will help so many of these businesses grow, while contributing to our operating margins over time. Advertising is also performing well. In Walmart U.S., the Walmart Connect team continues to deliver more value to the suppliers and sellers who advertise with us. Improvements to search and our large first-party shopper data have led to performance improvements for our advertisers, both year-over-year and sequentially. We have seen the number of active advertisers investing with us increase 121% over last year. Even more encouraging, these improvements have supported the overall site experience for our customers by helping them find the right products or discover new ones that are most relevant to them. As you have heard us say before, advertising is a global priority for us. We continue to see strong growth in markets outside the U.S., like India and Mexico. Turning to Sam\u2019s Club in the U.S., comp sales were strong again for Q2, up 10%, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Similar to Walmart, gross profit was pressured for the quarter on higher than normal markdown activity to clear through excess inventory. We will continue to make progress as we move through Q3 and we will be in good shape as we enter the holiday season. We like what we see in terms of membership. Total counts are up about 9% over last year and the penetration of Plus members continues to climb. Moving on to Walmart International, where we performed well again in Q2 with sales up nearly 10%, including double-digit comps in the three largest markets of Mexico, Canada and China. We are also accelerating our digital businesses, including strong e-commerce growth over the last 2 years. Mexico is up 31%; Canada, 32%; and China 152%. We see this growth even as customers choose to do more in-person shopping. It really shows the power of operating across multiple channels. Like the U.S., we see the effects of inflation come through in how people are shopping. In Mexico, we saw all formats perform well and Bodega was especially strong with comps above the overall Walmex average. We widened our price gaps for Bodega by 140 basis points in Q2 and we are seeing more customers shopping this format. While inflation remains high, most of our markets are growing comps ahead of inflation. I am proud that we are helping families access the things they need at more affordable prices. I will close today by thanking our associates for all they do everyday to support our customers and members. I\u2019d also like to welcome John David for his first earnings call with us. And with that, I will turn it over to him. John David Rainey : Thanks, Doug. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong sales quarter. We are moving a lot of volume through our business and I am proud of how our associate team has responded and serving customers as we manage through this unique period. We delivered strong top line growth with total constant currency revenue up more than 9% in the second quarter. Sales were strong across all segments, particularly in food and consumables. Customers are increasingly choosing Walmart to help them save money as they deal with broad inflationary pressures. As we navigate the current environment, we know that we are not immune to large macroeconomic shifts. We are facing similar cost pressures that others are seeing related to excess inventory, fuel prices and supply chain. But our business model is structurally sound and our market position is strong. As the year has progressed, we have seen more pronounced consumer shifts and trade-down activity. As an example, instead of deli meats at higher price points, customers are increasing purchases of hotdogs as well as canned tuna or chicken. Private brand penetration has also inflected higher. And in food category, specifically the private brand growth rate doubled compared to Q1 levels. We will continue to manage pricing for customers in a way that preserves our price gaps and allows us to earn market share profitably. We have been very focused on managing controllable costs and consequently achieved expense leverage across all three segments in Q2, even though we haven\u2019t fully lapped the wage investments implemented last year. During the quarter, we also made progress reducing inventory, managing prices to reflect certain supply chain costs and inflation and reducing storage costs associated with the backlog of shipping containers. We are encouraged by the initial steps taken by some suppliers to help us reduce product acquisition costs. We have taken similar steps to manage our support and overhead cost too and we are achieving significant savings in procurement of goods not for resale. In our stores and fulfillment and distribution centers, we have seen labor productivity metrics improve. We are finding efficiencies and reducing expenses, while still focusing on operational excellence. I want to spend a moment discussing inventory. As a backdrop, the shifts that we have seen in consumer behavior through the pandemic shifting from in-store to online, along with big swings in the purchase of goods versus services and then the reversion back to pre-pandemic norms have been sharp and difficult to predict. These trends have been exacerbated by inflationary pressure on the consumer that many of us have not experienced in our lifetime, the effect of which has recently changed consumption patterns in certain categories for us, notably general merchandise. The result of all of this put pressure on our inventory levels that peaked in the last quarter. Importantly, the team has a deep understanding of our inventory levels in content and have made a lot of progress during the last quarter. In-stock levels have improved about 250 basis points since Q1 in our grocery business alone, despite the heavy sales volumes we are experiencing. We also made progress selling through excess inventory, especially in hardline categories. At the end of Q2, Walmart U.S. inventory growth was 26% versus last year, reflecting over 750 basis points of improvement from Q1 levels. Notably, about 40% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. General merchandise inventory growth rates are down more than 15 percentage points from Q1, but still with more work to do. We have cleared most summer seasonal inventory, but we are still focused on reducing exposure to other areas such as electronics, home and sporting goods. We have also canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align inventory levels with expected demand. We estimate that only about 15% of our total inventory growth in Q2 is still above optimal levels and our actions in Q3 will allow us to make significant progress toward rationalizing absolute levels and mix, which will enable our stores to be well positioned ahead of the holiday season. Despite the short-term challenges we are facing this year, we continue to advance our flywheel strategy and diversify our income streams. For example, the global advertising business grew nearly 30% in Q2, led by Walmart Connect and Flipkart as new advertisers turn to Walmart to deepen relationships with customers. We now have over 240 million items in our U.S. e-commerce assortment and our marketplace seller count has increased about 60% year-over-year. We continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering and the number of Walmart+ memberships continues to grow. We are also excited about the build out of automation and technology throughout our business and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency. Through my first couple of months here, I have been able to get out and visit our stores and see our distribution and fulfillment centers and witness the supply chain automation and technology that we are putting in our stores and centers. One example is the Vizpick technology that we have rolled out to our associates across U.S. stores. This tool uses augmented reality to speed the inventory management process, enabling associates to get needed product from the backroom to the sales floor more efficiently. This not only saves associate time, but also helps avoid missing sales through side counter out of stocks. It\u2019s a win-win. In summary, our business is resilient. And with the omni capabilities we\u2019ve built, we are better positioned now than we were in prior periods of economic softness. Now, let\u2019s get to some additional Q2 financial details. As mentioned previously, each of our segments delivered strong sales growth. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated to 6.5% growth, reflecting strong grocery sales at a higher average ticket size. International constant currency sales were up 9.9% with strength in Mexico, Canada and China, while Sam\u2019s Club U.S. delivered comps of 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco. Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 132 basis points, reflecting increased markdowns and unfavorable mix shifts in our U.S. businesses. Sam\u2019s Club gross profit was also negatively affected by a LIFO charge due to higher inflation. On the expense side, selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 45 basis points, helped by higher sales partially offset by the U.S. wage investments implemented last year. Operating income decreased 6.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.77. Two discrete items positively affected our results. Operating income benefited from a favorable insurance settlement of $173 million during the quarter. Adjusted EPS also benefited from this as well as a $182 million special dividend from one of our equity investments. Operating cash flow was $9.2 billion, reflecting lower operating income, higher inventory amounts due in part to inflation and the timing of certain payments. During the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. Through Q2, we are ahead of pace on our original share repurchase plan for this year and now expect to repurchase $10 billion to $11 billion in shares for fiscal year 2023. Now, let\u2019s discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales momentum continued with growth excluding fuel of 11.7% on a 2-year stack. Food sales were especially strong with mid-teens growth while general merchandise sales were soft, particularly in electronics, apparel and home. Transactions increased 1%, while average ticket increased 5.5%. We were pleased to see e-commerce sales growth improve sequentially, up 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 18% on a 2-year stack. SG&A expenses leveraged 21 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by the wage investments. The team did a nice job pivoting the expense structure, so the scheduling challenges from Q1 did not repeat. Gross margin pressure led to a decline in operating income of about 7%. International had another really good quarter. Sales were strong, up 9.9% in constant currency. Currency headwinds negatively affected reported sales results by about $1 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, with Mexico and China leading the way. E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis grew 15% on top of strong gains last year. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 11%, with strong growth in stores as well as e-commerce sales, which grew 18%. The team is doing a good job reinforcing our price message and positioning as customers manage through this inflationary period. In China, comp sales were up more than 14%, with strong growth in e-commerce sales, which increased 77% in the quarter and more than 150% on a 2-year stack. E-commerce penetration continues to climb in both our Sam\u2019s Clubs and hypermarket stores as customers increasingly choose omni solutions to meet their shopping needs. Canada comp sales increased more than 10% even as higher levels of inflation are starting to pressure consumer spending in discretionary and general merchandise categories. Flipkart continues to meet our expectations and the team is gearing up for Big Billion Days. I traveled to India last month and was impressed by how the Flipkart and PhonePe teams are innovating for the customer and driving growth. PhonePe continued to see strong growth, with annualized TPV of over $830 billion, reaching a record level of monthly transactions of about $3.1 billion. International operating income in constant currency increased more than 28%, partially attributable to the previously mentioned insurance recovery for prior operational disruptions in Chile. Sam\u2019s Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of more than 20% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 9.8%. E-commerce sales grew 25%, with strong contributions from both curbside and ship-to-home orders. Membership income was up nearly 9%, with another record high quarter in overall member counts and continued growth in Plus member penetration. Sam\u2019s added more new members in Q2 than any other quarter in recent years, benefiting from membership campaigns. Sam\u2019s leveraged expenses 131 basis points, including fuel and 72 basis points excluding fuel, due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID costs. But gross margins were down as elevated markdowns, supply chain and fulfillment cost and a 70 basis point inflation-related LIFO charge pressured profitability. As a result, operating income declined about 35%. Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance. With the updated financial guidance we released last month, we outlined the pressures that led us to take a more conservative outlook for the current year profitability. Let me take a minute to provide you with more detail. When we provided guidance 3 months ago, we didn\u2019t expect food and fuel inflation to accelerate to the levels that we experienced in Q2. In fact, Walmart U.S. food inflation was up double-digits year-over-year and we saw a nearly 400 basis points step up as the quarter progressed compared to levels at the end of Q1. The rising cost for essential items and customers\u2019 reprioritization spending led to significant mix shifts in our business. Grocery sales mix increased nearly 300 basis points, whereas general merchandise sales mix decreased more than 350 basis points. This resulted in additional general merchandise markdowns in our U.S. business, particularly in apparel at a time when inventory clearance was already higher than expected in the industry. Higher fuel prices also pressured our supply chain expense. We finished the quarter on a strong note, however, and ahead of our updated Q2 guidance provided last month, and the Q3 back-to-school season is off to a solid start. Contributing factors to the better performance included strong sales at the end of the month with good flow-through to the bottom line and lower-than-expected supply chain cost. We\u2019re taking additional pricing actions in Q3 to improve inventory levels in the back half of the year, and we built in more conservative category mix assumptions within our guidance. Our sales and profit view reflects trends we\u2019ve seen year-to-date as well as the uncertainty around inflation and consumer spending in the coming quarters. We\u2019ve updated our fiscal year \u201823 guidance to reflect the better Q2 results versus the guidance we provided in July. We continue to believe the sales and profit guidance we provided at the time for the back half of the year appropriately reflects elevated uncertainty in this environment and is our best view of expected performance. For Q3, we expect net sales growth of about 5%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S. We\u2019re expecting operating income to decline 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS to decline 9% to 11%. For fiscal year \u201823, we expect net sales growth of about 4.5%, including comp sales growth of about 4% for Walmart U.S. We expect adjusted operating income and EPS to decline 9% to 11%. Excluding the effect of divestitures, this would translate into net sales growth of 5.5% and a decline in adjusted operating income and EPS of 8% to 10%. Before I close, I\u2019d like to share my perspective as someone that is new to Walmart and meeting many of you for the first time. I\u2019m excited to join the company at such an opportunistic and transformational time. Certainly, retail broadly is being pressured right now, but that shouldn\u2019t detract from the incredible opportunity that we have in front of us. It starts with our mission of helping people save money so they can live better. We do that every day at a scale that is unmatched by helping people be able to buy the things that they want and they need. This mission permeates our culture in everything that we do. I\u2019ve joined an exceptional leadership team. Their history of operational excellence, their strategy, the drive to win is simply something that I wanted to be a part of. And you combine that with the resources we have and the investments we\u2019re making in things like supply chain automation, improving our e-commerce capabilities and diversifying our portfolio with higher-margin products and services like data and advertising that will result in more durable earnings streams as they scale. We have the potential to not only be relevant in the next chapter of retail, but help define it. And when we execute on these things, we have the ability to appreciably increase our shareholder value over time. I believe that some of the best days of Walmart are in front of us. I look forward to working with you, and now we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Bob Drbul : Good morning. And John David, welcome. Congratulations. John David Rainey : Thank you. Bob Drbul : Maybe two quick questions, if I could. The first one, I think, Doug, you mentioned that sort of middle and higher income shoppers are choosing Walmart. Just wondering if you can elaborate some more on the trade into Walmart that is allowing you to take market share in grocery. And the second question is just wondering if you could give us a little bit more flavor on what you\u2019re seeing, what you saw sort of with sales late in the quarter and what you\u2019re really seeing so far early Q3? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Yes. Hi, Bob, this is Doug. I\u2019ll kick it off and then ask John to comment. In Walmart U.S. business, we have seen mid- to higher income customers come to Walmart looking for value, as you would expect, food and consumables, in particular, are places where they are looking to save some money. That\u2019s not a total surprise. I think the strength of it is encouraging. And then as it relates to the end of the quarter, there were several things going on. Fuel prices started to move a little bit. Back to school was strong. And then this income phenomenon that you pointed to also provided some strength to the last week or so of the last month of the quarter, which was a little different than the pattern that we had seen in the first 2 months of the quarter. John David Rainey : Yes, Doug, it was a bit different than May and June, for sure, and it led \u2013 it has led to the beginning of Q3 being stronger in places like back-to-school. Food and consumables continue their momentum. And I think the big [Indiscernible] changed in late Q3, early \u2013 sorry, late Q2, early Q3 was traffic count was a bit stronger than what we have seen in the businesses in 2 months. Doug McMillon : We were laughing before the call started today about some of the anecdotal stuff that\u2019s going on. It won\u2019t surprise you that backpacks are strong, for example, but it does surprise us how strong men\u2019s flannel is. And we\u2019ve got a program that\u2019s just under $12. I bought two of them personally, and it\u2019s a great value. And at the same time, some of our clearance price points have gotten really low. We\u2019re trying to work through what we would call season code two apparel, and we\u2019ve got new stuff selling well. So it\u2019s almost like you can point to different areas to kind of make the case for what you want the sales story to be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Our question is centered around markdowns. We are curious if the level of markdowns that plan to be taken in Q3 will be at a similar level as what you did for Q2. And it sounds like inventory will be much cleaner by Q4, but it seems like there is still a lot of inventory in the industry and the consumer that might need to be motivated by promotions given the amount of inflation. How should we think about the markdown environment then in Q4 even in the context of cleaner inventory at Walmart? Doug McMillon : Hi, Kate, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. I think what we should do is hear from all three segments as it relates to that. We\u2019ve made progress. John, why don\u2019t you go first, but let\u2019s also hear from Kath and from Judith. John Furner : Good morning, Kate. I start with the second quarter from the end of Q1 to beginning of Q2, there was some definite progress in inventory, about 750 basis points of improvement. We view Q2 as being most urgent to clear through the apparel and some are seasonal that we needed out of the way and sold before Q3 really began to arrive. We certainly made progress in apparel. There is more work to be done in inventory in general with a 25% increase and about 40% of that inflation, then the remaining does two things. One, it helps us in terms of in-stock we were out of stock last year all throughout the year. So we have made improvements on in stock. I think our results in many categories reflect improvements in availability in in-stock. But then there is some backlog that we continue to work through. At the end of Q1, we said this would take a couple of quarters to work through. I would just reiterate that, that remains true. And we will continue to leave room to make sure that we manage our inventory levels well and head into a position in Q4 at the end of the year that we will be proud of. Doug McMillon : I think the fact that we were so lean last year, combined with how much inflation impacted the number, has kind of been lost in the story a bit. It\u2019s true that we\u2019ve got too much inventory and that, that created a markdown pressure, particularly in Walmart U.S. apparel. But when we look at the overall inventory, as John David has already commented today, it\u2019s not like the vast majority of it is merchandise that we didn\u2019t want. We just were turning goods 1 year ago and the year before that, frankly, at such a high level that we needed that inventory just to fill side counters and to fill our features. John Furner : That\u2019s right. In 2020, 2021, we would have had record sell-throughs in seasonal categories with very few markdowns at the end of season. And so of course, there is some normalization to get back to where we might have been before the pandemic would be in. But again, we still have \u2013 we\u2019re still need some time to work through the remaining excess inventory. Doug McMillon : We\u2019re repeating ourselves, but the level of and the pace at which inflation changed in the first quarter, and that continued in food and consumables into the second, just caused behavior to flip fast and that caused apparel to be more difficult than what we anticipated, and that\u2019s where the dollars markdown pressure came from. Kath, do you want to go next? Kath McLay : Yes, I\u2019d really just say, if I look at our inventory position at the moment, for the last 2 years, like we talked about, we\u2019ve had 10 quarters of double-digit comps. For the last 2 years, we\u2019ve struggled to stay in front of having enough inventory. And then so we\u2019re off a deflated base when you look at what our current position is. This year, then obviously have the contraction with inflation. But what we\u2019ve seen is that we\u2019ve got really good quality inventory. We\u2019re really happy with what the seasonal sets we\u2019ve got. Halloween looks fantastic; back to school, back to college has been good. Tailgating has been great. I think what I would say is in our number in this quarter, a portion of it has been markdowns and a portion of it is actually inventory reserve because we wanted to get in front of it and just make sure that we put aside the money for Q3 so that we can have a really strong Q3 kind of results. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve addressed markdowns in Q2. Judith McKenna : For International, we saw some good progress on inventory quarter-on-quarter, some of that helped by the FX position on that, but underlying as well. I think as I look at it, about 75% our increase year-on-year is absolutely planned for. And as you\u2019ve heard that leanness that we had last year is really coming through. And I think that\u2019s theme for everybody. We just didn\u2019t have enough inventory at that time. That leaves about 25% of it, which is some GM categories in a couple of markets, specifically, which would be Chile and Canada. But I\u2019m very comfortable with the way that the market has dealt with that. And just as a reminder, for at least Chile, our quarter end is a month earlier than the enterprise quarter end. So we\u2019re already seeing some of that clearance happening for that market. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to talk a little bit about grocery, the strength there, particularly in food. Can you talk about pricing, how you\u2019re managing that? I know units, it looks like they were down for the quarter, but improving to, I guess, flattish as you exited the quarter. Just how are you thinking about pricing relative to units? What\u2019s the promotional environment you\u2019re seeing within grocery and just how the grocery strength is split in store versus online and curbside? Thank you. John David Rainey : Hi, good morning, Peter. It\u2019s John. Let me take your question in parts for just a second here. I mean, first, value is always top of mind when it comes to us and deciding how we want to serve customers. So we will always lean on the value for the customers above other things. And what we want to do and what we try to do throughout this entire period is go up as late as possible. We certainly have been passing prices through when we see things like landed cost of goods going up, those have to be passed through. We\u2019re managing our supply costs as well as we can. Units did strengthen throughout the quarter, particularly in July and late July. I think you heard that earlier. So seeing some positive units there was refreshing given how we had started the quarter. Fuel prices were coming down. So we think that could have had some of an impact as well. In terms of the market, we\u2019re really focused on everyday low price. We have a strong rollback campaign all across the store, which would include food, consumables and general merchandise. And then in general, just across the food categories, our availability improvements, I think you can see in stores more consistently and across categories. Just you remember this time last year, we had pockets about of stocks that kept emerging the only one that we really faced in the second quarter in a big way was baby formula, which is now improving. Doug McMillon : The unit story is, one, the transaction count being up a little in this environment is also important to call out. The average basket was way up, but it\u2019s great to see transactions grow in the Walmart U.S. business also. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Good day, everyone. I wanted to follow-up, Doug, on your comments regarding how the basket is shifting for consumers. I think you mentioned in the proteins category and even some areas of private label strengthening. Maybe take us into the household budgeting that you\u2019re seeing with respect to your transaction structure. And then as you\u2019re looking at your guidance for the back half, maybe a follow-up would be what you\u2019re assuming in terms of the basket composition class of good or even within private label versus national brands? Thank you so much. Doug McMillon : Yes, John, you jump in here, too. I think what you should take away from Q3 and Q4 guidance is that we\u2019re expecting the environment to look a lot like Q2. And as it relates to the choices people are making, the thing I would call out John\u2019s variety that you\u2019ve got all kinds of income levels shopping in different ways and we\u2019ve seen strength in some categories. It\u2019s really encouraging. For those that are under the most pressure, that are most price-sensitive, private brands are stronger, pack sizes are different. Opening price points, John, you might talk a little bit about what you saw at the holiday meeting, looking at for things like the Thanksgiving meal. The team\u2019s doing a great job of protecting opening price points for people that are most price conscious. John Furner : Steph, as thinking back, one of the meetings we had in New York in 2020, we talked a lot about serving customers flexibly as we develop the different businesses. And so just to tag on to Doug\u2019s comments, serving customers in store is something we have pressed ourselves on a long time. Our pickup business continues. Delivery is growing with Walmart. So the variety of ways that we can serve customers, I think it\u2019s been helpful, especially given the number of ships customers that have had in their lives the last couple of years from working at home and then in many cases, back out into the workplace. So as customers change, we can serve them in a number of ways. When you then click into products, our wide portfolio of products, both in e-commerce and in stores, including the numbers you heard from John David earlier in Marketplace, gives us the ability to serve a wide range of customers. And then as Doug mentioned last week, we had all of our managers together in Denver, which is always a fun exciting experience to get the team together. But what I heard consistently is as the team is doing a very nice job balancing out how to improve quality and sell higher price points and remaining focused on opening price points. So having Thanksgiving meals in a position where you can buy an entire meal for under $50 for a family of four is exciting. So there is a value play, and there is a quality play. And wherever the customer goes and how things shifts, we will be ready to serve them and we\u2019re building the capabilities to be able to do that at will. John David Rainey : Steph, I would just add. This is John David. As it relates to our guidance in the back half of the year, the swings that we\u2019ve seen in consumer behavior have been difficult to predict and the pace at which they have happened has been sharp. And so our guidance for the back half really just assumes no change in what we\u2019re seeing in the second quarter in terms of mix changes in our business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Welcome, John David. John David Rainey : Thank you. Michael Lasser : Walmart\u2019s been experiencing some discrete and arguably temporary factors that are weighing on its profitability this year, including staffing issues in 1Q and the well-documented inventory issues. So looking towards next year, when some of these inflationary pressures, inflationary cost pressures are going to seemingly roll back and you\u2019ll have moved through some of the challenges and the underlying drivers of the operating, alternative operating profit growth should continue, why wouldn\u2019t Walmart be in a position to generate growth above its long-term algorithm in 2023? Doug McMillon : Sure. I\u2019ll take that, Michael. Thanks for the question. You\u2019re right. Certainly, we\u2019ve incurred some costs this year that are more, call it, one-time in nature related to the supply chain and higher inflation, but it\u2019s difficult to predict how long that will persist. Certainly, the inventory situation has gotten better. But the effect on the mix changes in our business that are largely the result of higher inflation, and that may persist for some time. And so we\u2019re being cautious with respect to the outlook. We\u2019re obviously not giving guidance for next year right now. But look, what I\u2019d point you to is the conviction that we have in our long-term plan has not changed, has not wavered. When you look at the long-term plan that was laid out by the management team previously in terms of what we\u2019re doing with the flywheel strategy, the ability to grow operating income faster than revenue. And you look at that over a multiyear basis, we have as much conviction today as we did when we laid that out. So very excited about the future. But the short-term period, this is a moment in time, and we\u2019re being cautious with respect to the outlook because there is a lot that we don\u2019t know. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Edward Yruma : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. John David, curious on your perspective, given your most recent stop on Walmart\u2019s advertising and fintech businesses, you have a lot of experience from PayPal on that. How do you assess kind of where they are at today? And kind of how do you think about the longer-term growth opportunity? Thank you. John David Rainey : Sure. I appreciate the question. Well, certainly, I am a believer in what\u2019s happening in digital payments, fintech broadly, and the secular tailwinds that exist there with consumer behavior, moving more digital, more online. And if you look at the investments that Walmart has been making, they are in those areas, whether it be expanding their e-commerce capabilities, their marketplaces, even getting into financial services. As I have an early peek into what the company is doing, I\u2019ve got to say I\u2019m very impressed with the broad capabilities and the resources devoted to this. And so I think it\u2019s a huge opportunity for Walmart going forward. And frankly, one of the reasons that I\u2019m so excited to join, to be part of this and help shape this outcome. Judith McKenna : Maybe it\u2019s worth adding on Financial Services PhonePe in India. You heard that we were there recently, and John David, you were there with us as well and got to visit the business there. It was \u2013 you\u2019ll have seen from the scripts that we had today that they grew their annualized transact TPV to 830 billion. Last quarter, that was 770 billion. So really good progress there, and they are also now got monthly transactions of 3.1 billion a month, which is incredible. I think what\u2019s really encouraging way that they are approaching this space is they are looking not only at payments, but also merchant services, and that two-sided network is an important part of that, but equally, starting to expand into financial services as well with a real focus at the moment on insurance and pushing that. Their knowledge and the ability to share that knowledge around the world and help other markets such as Mexico from a best practices, what they should be looking at, has been incredibly invaluable and one of the real benefits of being a global company. John David Rainey : I\u2019ll just add, Judith that I shared the excitement that we all had when we went to India and met with the team. To put it in perspective what PhonePe is doing and if you look at the largest digital payments companies outside of China and the world, PhonePe, after a very brief history, is already roughly two-thirds of the size of that and what is going to be the largest market in the world in a very short period of time. So it\u2019s a really exciting opportunity. Doug McMillon : Sure. I think you also asked about advertising. The relationship between digital growth, marketplace growth, advertising is something that we\u2019re trying to take advantage of. In the case of the U.S. business, the ability to attribute sales later on to in-store transactions makes us uniquely positioned. And we\u2019ve made a few enhancements lately for people that are consuming advertising from us. John Furner : We have Doug, and knowing more about customers and the way they shop, knowing more about them in retail is important, and the growth in pickup and delivery and the growth in Plus, the growth in marketplace and e-commerce all help us be able to identify the right sellers and suppliers that we can connect, hence the term \u2013 the name Walmart Connect. We can connect them together to have an environment where not only is it accretive to the profit and loss statement, but more importantly, accretive to the customer experience and help them get to exactly what they are looking for. John David Rainey : I can\u2019t remember a business with the margin structure of the advertising business here at Walmart and having 30% growth for the quarter was nice to have. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Hi. Good morning. And I will add my welcome to you, John David. John David Rainey : Thank you, Kelly. Kelly Bania : A lot of comments on the inventory, but just had a couple of more. Can you clarify the dollar amount of inventory that you estimate would be excess? And can you help us understand how much of that is in apparel or other categories and the magnitude of markdown that you expect to clear through that and the timing of when you expect to get back to a clean position? And I guess to follow-up on that, do you at all think that this discounting from you and others in the industry could pull forward some demand through from the second half? And have you considered that into your second half guidance? John David Rainey : Sure. I will take a stab at that, Kelly. So, if you think about just take the U.S. inventory increase in the second quarter of $11 billion. If you decompose that, about 40% of that is due to inflation. So, don\u2019t think units, think just dollars. And then you look, as Doug noted, at things like the fact that we are growing as a company that we have had less in stock next year and you normalize for all of that, you really whittle that down to about $1.5 billion of inventory that if we can just wave a magic wand, we would make go away today. And the fact is we will sell that. But if we were to start from scratch, that\u2019s what when we get rid of. In terms of the types, as John noted, the inventory issues were most acute in apparel in the second quarter. As we look into the third quarter, I would say it\u2019s home electronics and apparel are probably the areas that stand out the most. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Good morning everyone. Still focusing on gross margin, the U.S. gross was down about 106 or so or 107 in the second quarter. Can you comment how much is mix versus markdown? And to us, it looks like the mix is not getting any worse, if that\u2019s fair. And then the clearance levels in Q3 versus Q2, will the clearance/markdown occupy a greater proportion in the third quarter versus the second? Doug McMillon : Sure. Simeon, I will take a stab at that as well, and John might want to jump in. So, if \u2013 I will just point you to the 132 basis point decline overall in gross margins. And there is really three things that I would say in order of magnitude that contributed to about, call it, two-thirds to 75% of that. So, number one would be markdowns, number two is mix, and number three is the LIFO charge that we talked about in Sam\u2019s. And then there is all the various puts and takes that round out the balance of that. As it relates to markdowns in the third quarter, look, we feel like we are in a better inventory position and those are obviously very related. And so we would hope that we are not going to see the level of markdowns that we experienced in the second quarter. But we also \u2013 that\u2019s assuming that nothing changes with the consumer. So, as we noted, we are being cautious on the outlook, and we will wait and see what happens. John Furner : In the U.S., Simeon, this is John. In the U.S., we did not have the LIFO charge, so a larger percentage of our markdown issue would have been in apparel. We still have a bit more to work through, but we are close if you compare to where we might have been before 2 years ago. So, we are getting close to a position where apparel is behind us. And that was the issue that throughout Q2, we spent the most time worrying about because we need to move through it because the goods have been purchased a long way out. Regarding the rest, in Q1 and then in Q2, as the backlog of containers worked itself through, that has created a lot of what the issue is today, where we felt good that we would have liked to have had months ago, and then this season is all here at the same time. So, we have ingested all that inventory. We have largely gotten out of the container storage and movement business. We have the inventory in the network. So, we have a good handle on what we own, where it is. And then as I said earlier in the call, the end of Q1, we need a couple of quarters to work through it, and that\u2019s exactly what we do. So, John David is right. We will sell it. We will work through it. Yes, there will be some liability in it. But apparel was definitely the issue that we had that was most skewed and would have really hurt us had we not addressed it. Sorry, Dan, go ahead. Dan Binder : I was going to say, Simeon, on your mix question, if you go into our filings, you will see our mix change year-over-year, and you will see that in Q2 as well when we file our Q. At the end of Q1, it was a fairly significant shift as we were lapping stimulus spending. We recalibrated our expectations at the end of Q1, and then it was even worse than we expected for Q2. So, that\u2019s what you are seeing get reflected in our view as we look to the back half, we don\u2019t want to kind of get ahead of ourselves just because sales have been strengthening at the end of the quarter. Doug McMillon : Yes, I was going to kind of double click on that a little bit more, too. Fuel coming down in recent weeks is helpful. It\u2019s still about 27% inflated per gallon versus a year ago nationally. So, the absolute spend that an American family is deploying the fuel is still high, is the amount of food inflation. And I think Q4 last year is the moment where we started to see U.S. food inflation tick up. It was kind of low to mid-single digits. So, when you get to Q4, you start to anniversary a food inflation number against a food inflation number. So, the 2-year stack of food inflation will be something that we will be keeping an eye on. If you told us that fuel was going to continue to tick down and that food inflation was going to moderate, that influences how we think about general merchandise inventory. And as we worked with the merchants over the last few weeks, it\u2019s been kind of fascinating to think through how you make choices atom, atom, atom and atom like in category-by-category because you don\u2019t want to go into too much of a defensive mode, and we were looking at Halloween decor last week, John, and there are some things, outdoor decor, particularly like inflatables, that are really fun, cool and new items. And when you see them, you are like, we can sell. Oh, you can buy that, like we are going to blow out of some of those. And we want the buyers in some categories to have that mentality and be aggressive. In other places, we want to be more conservative so that we don\u2019t repeat the mistakes that we have had in the first half of this year. That\u2019s such an interesting thing to work through. It takes a lot more leadership from our merchant team, for example, that it might ordinarily, we think we have made some good decisions subcategory-by-subcategory for the back half of this year, canceled some orders, trying to get that right area-by-area so that we don\u2019t end up being too conservative in places where we shouldn\u2019t be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Robby Ohmes : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think a follow-up on that, Doug. I think it\u2019s probably harder for you guys to predict where fuel prices are going, but you have some visibility on food inflation given how large you are a player in that. It accelerated a lot in the second quarter. Has that continued in the third quarter? And I guess, does the guidance, it assumes it stays at the level of the second quarter, or do you think it could be up more in 3Q before maybe it fades against the comparisons in the fourth \u2013 any kind of color on what you are assuming would be great. And a quick second one for Kath is just the home and apparel comps were much stronger at Sam\u2019s. Was that all clearance, or is there something different between Sam\u2019s and Walmart U.S. in terms of home apparel sales? John Furner : Hey Robby, it\u2019s John. I will take the first part of your question. In relation to \u2013 as it relates to food inflation, it definitely moved up in the second quarter and moved up in the months of the second quarter. So, July was higher than June. June was higher than May. I think it\u2019s too early into the third quarter to try to make a call if this is where we will be, if it will go higher or go down. So, for now, we are assuming that this is the level we are at and it could continue. And some of the factors though to consider is one of the costs that are part of the way we price food is the cost of moving food. So, diesel fuel and fuel continue to move down, that could be a tailwind related to inflation. However, there are still some commodities up. We do see a few categories in the store where prices are starting to come down, but there are other categories where we are still rising. So, I think it\u2019s just too early to call in the quarter. Certainly hope that some of these larger macroeconomic conditions would lead to lower prices in food, but we are not able to say that we see that happening just yet. Kath McLay : And it\u2019s Kath from Sam\u2019s. On the home and apparel, what I would say is it\u2019s actually a multiyear story. So, it\u2019s not clearance. It\u2019s been the investments we have made in the quality that we have had in home, apparel and seasonal, and we are seeing better quality brands, and we have seen that resonate with our member base, and that has continued through into this year. Doug McMillon : Also a higher income member than the profile you would see in Walmart U.S. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first on the markdown front, I was curious if you can at all comment on what you guys view \u2013 you view as excess markdowns as we try to think about next year? And then secondly, on Sam\u2019s Club gross margins declined nearly 300 basis points. I want to get a sense of if you expect any of that to be structural, or do you expect that to recover the margin decline over time? John Furner : Hi Rupesh, good morning. On markdowns, kind of break it into pieces. Last year and the year before, there weren\u2019t really many markdowns to speak of because we were chasing demand and in many cases, at the end of the seasons were very clean. So, returning to the point where there are in the season markdowns is a pretty normal thing that we would experience. And the way we are trying to manage the sell-through season-by-season as compared to historical rates back in 2018, 2019. And of course, things are always going to be different, but it\u2019s a vibrometer that determine where we land. The second the business is much larger than it was in 2019. So, these volume levels continue to improve, which then leads to the dynamic of how much you purchase, which ultimately amount you purchase versus demand will lead you to your sell-through and markdown numbers. So, for the fourth quarter, we mentioned we have canceled billions in orders. We feel much better about the back half of the year. We still have inventory to work through and ingest from the backlogs, as we said. So, we need a couple of quarters to do that. And then heading into the next year, we will have purchasing levels that are more in line with the way we see demand as it\u2019s going today. Of course, a lot can change. We need to know more about fuel pricing and inflation in the state of the consumers we get there, but we have definitely had more time and more success in getting purchasing in line with our current inventory levels and the way we see demand going in terms of mix today. Kath McLay : And for the Sam\u2019s part of the question, I would say if you look at our GP rate, there is two major things going on there. One is the LIFO charge of $123 million, and the other one is what we had called markdowns. But there\u2019s two things at a play there. The largest part of that amount is a strategic decision we made to create an inventory reserve for Q3. And so that\u2019s really pulling forward those markdowns from Q3 into Q2 to set ourselves up for success and to make sure that we are really competitive going into Q3. So, I don\u2019t see that as a trend. I see that as just this quarter, the impact on this quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question. Joe Feldman : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to check in on what you are seeing with the supply chain these days. I mean I know fuel cost has come down, and we are hearing container cost prices have come down. But are you getting a more regular flow of inventory as you need at this point, or just your view of the global supply team would be really helpful. Thanks. John Furner : Hey Joe, it\u2019s John. First, let me just say a big thank you to our supply chain team, our merchants. They have been through a lot. The environment has been extremely dynamic, and they have really just made a huge difference for the entire company. In the last couple of quarters, what\u2019s it been like and there was the backlog of containers that really started last fall when the ports backed up. We have worked those through. In terms of container costs, they are down from where they were, but they are still higher than they were a year ago and the year ago was higher than \u2013 it\u2019s higher than they were the year before that. So, still inflated, and those costs are flowing through. Fuel costing, as Doug said earlier, fuel has come down from its peak at the end of Q1, early Q2, but it still remains elevated. And those are real costs that are passed through and customers will see those prices at the counter and on the site. So, in general, we see better flow. We see better availability. Our availability rates in food, consumables and then our consumable portions of general merchandise are much better than they were a year ago. But I still think we have work to do to get back to where we were back in 2019, but still uneven in places. And any time in retail, that inventories back up the way they did. It does cause pressure on being able to get the right inventory at the right location in front of the customer. So, optimistic that can improve as these inventories come down, but it\u2019s going to take a few more months to work through the backlog of the inventory that\u2019s in the network. Doug McMillon : Joe, I would just add from a P&L perspective and you think about the cadence of earnings from 3Q to 4Q. We started experiencing more pronounced supply chain costs in 4Q last year. So, from a cost side, that makes the comps a little bit easier and if you are thinking about operating income in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Grom : Hi. Thanks very much and welcome John David. When you unpack the factors behind the better back-to-school and strong finish in July, and it sounds like in August so far, I guess how would you rank the key contributors? Lower gas prices, there was a big uptick in state tax holidays this year versus last. And I guess has the improvement altered your view of the upcoming holiday season in any way in terms of how you think the consumer is going to react? John Furner : Hey Chuck, good morning. And I think there are three factors that stand out, and you will see this in the numbers. One is there are more customers shopping in the brand than we have seen previously, including better traffic numbers. Fuel prices did come down throughout the month of July. And I think the third that\u2019s important is school attendance levels, we think will be higher. There are very few instances of schools that are remote at this point, and there were some of those last year. So, things like backpacks and lunch boxes. And then there are other programs where some school lunches were paid for last year that this year will be funded by families and parents. So, there is a shift in all of those factors that are leading to more spending late in July and early in the third quarter. As far as how it relates to the rest of the year, again, so a lot of unknowns as we get into the rest of the year. Fuel prices are still moving, but they continue to move down, that would be a great thing. And we will have to watch the shape of the consumer and see how they are buying. But I would just reiterate what John David said earlier, we are really committed to the long-term plan and our long-term view of the business. And it\u2019s been great to see some of the improvements in the areas on the flywheel that are adjacent to retail that will help the overall business over the long-term. Doug McMillon : John, I would add as it relates to better-than-expected performance for 2Q. As noted, supply chain costs came in better than we expected. And in any quarter, when you close, you are going to have some puts and takes at the end of the quarter. Some may fall in your favor. Some may work against you. In the first quarter, supply chain costs came in worse than what we expected when we closed the quarter. And so when we updated our guidance at the end of last month, we had a similar expectation. It actually fell the other way in our favor. And so that contributes to the better-than-expected performance relative to our guidance at the end of last month. John David Rainey : I would just add, when you are thinking about supply chain costs, and we are getting invoices all quarter end-to-end, a lot of the things that we were experiencing these last several quarters have been unusual, container fines and excess fuel charges and things like that. So, there was \u2013 it was a higher \u2013 an expectation of higher cost and it just came \u2013 it felt favorably. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will be from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Ben Bienvenu : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask when you move through a cycle like this with consumers trading down and between the price and you gain market share and pick up new customers, how sticky does that share end up being on the other side of this inflation? Might we see this bolster your long-term share position and maybe leave you guys coming out of this environment in a stronger position with the consumer? And then as a follow-up, you noted you are seeing middle end and some helpful trading into Walmart. What are you seeing from lower-income households? Are you seeing any trading down away from Walmart? Doug McMillon : Yes. We certainly hope to hold share around the world, and I think this inflationary environment is going to last for a while. So, people are going to be value conscious, which plays to our strengths. The e-commerce experience end-to-end is a focus of ours. We want to continue to grow our pickup and delivery businesses around the world. We, of course, want to grow and maintain share of customer spend in the stores as well. Moving away, I think if any of you want to comment, you can, I think we are holding at the lower end and adding at the upper end, generally speaking. John Furner : Doug, I think that\u2019s exactly right. And in relation to the first part of your question, Ben, what have we seen in previous cycles. We did see some pickup in the last cycle. That was a downturn in 2008, \u201809. But there are a few things that are different now that I think I would like to point out. And in that time period, we had our store business and a small e-commerce business. We did not have food pickup. We didn\u2019t do delivery from stores. We didn\u2019t deliver groceries. We did not have Walmart in-home. We didn\u2019t have Walmart+. So, our ability to serve customers more flexibly \u2013 in a more flexible manner than what we could have 13 years, 14 years ago was pretty dramatic. So, definitely a lot of work to do to ensure that we are taking care of those customers and we are focused every week on satisfaction scores and accuracy of delivery and things like first-time pick rate, which is an indicator of did we get your entire order right at the very first time we try to deliver it. Those will all be important in terms of being able to hold on to new customers. But we definitely have a number of ways that we can serve customers today that just, quite frankly, did not exist the last time we went through a downturn. Doug McMillon : Planning to sell some more Walmart+ memberships to help solidify those relationships, and the Paramount announcement should help us do that. John Furner : Yes. We are excited about the announcement, Doug. The brand Paramount has a lot of programming for kids. It has live sports. There are other movies and drama. So, it\u2019s a wide variety of content that I think our members will enjoy. And that was, quite frankly, a member-led research. When we talk to members and ask what are the benefits they were looking for, the number one feature outside of delivery of product from both stores and e-commerce was an entertainment benefit. And there were others they talked about, but entertainment was at the top of the list, and that\u2019s what led to the decision to add this benefit to the program. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I will turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : Yes. As usual, thanks for your attention. We appreciate you focusing on our company. I will just wrap up with maybe three points. The first one is, hopefully, you are seeing in the results and hearing from us that we are making progress. We are addressing our inventory issues. We are pricing to reflect our cost structure. Secondly, more people are choosing Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club and our brands around the world. Bodega business in Mexico, for example, is really strong. So, being able to attract more and more customers and a more diverse set of customers is a positive for us. And then third, we are continuing to change the business, execute our strategy, our e-commerce growth, our digital transformation, growing the marketplace, growing these related businesses that are unlocked by this digital transformation that\u2019s happening in the company is something that we are focused on. Regardless of the short-term pressures, we are making progress towards the longer term. We certainly hope to put the pressures that we have had in the first half behind us as quickly as we can, claw back the operating income percentage delta that we have experienced in the first half to the extent possible, as fast as possible. But as you can see in our guidance, we acknowledge reality. The world around \u2013 around the world is feeling various pressures, most pronounced from inflation, of course. So, we think we put ourselves in a good spot to continue to make progress and value. When customers and members are focused on values is something that plays to our strengths. So, we will take full advantage of that. Thank you, all. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Steph, you may begin. Steph Wissink : Thank you. Welcome to Walmart's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; John David Rainey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam's Club. In a few moments, Doug and John David will provide you an update on the business and discuss third quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session. Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon. Doug McMillon : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our results for the third quarter. Let me highlight what you'll hear from us this morning. First, it was a good quarter. We delivered strong results on the top line across our segments, and our value proposition is resonating with customers and members around the world. We see this in our grocery business in stores and online in key markets like the U.S. and Mexico. Customers that came to us less frequently in the past are now shopping with us more often, including higher-income customers. Second, we're being thoughtful and balanced about inventory levels by category and expenses as we work through the fourth quarter and position ourselves for next year. There are places where we'll remain aggressive and others where we're being more conservative. Third, while we prioritize retail fundamentals, we're also connecting and scaling newer, naturally related capabilities to our larger business so they become mutually reinforcing. Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising are examples. As it relates to the third quarter, it began with top line momentum from the back-to-school season in the U.S. and Mexico, and that continued through festivals in India, China and through early Deals for Days events in the U.S. Walmex had a great quarter and so did Sam's Club in the U.S. as we continued our string of double-digit comp club sales growth. Kath and the team at Sam's have run double-digit comps for almost 3 years. We like the way those numbers compound. As a total company, we're seeing strength in stores, clubs and e-commerce. Transactions are positive, and our penetration of e-commerce sales continues to climb. So far this year, 13% of our total sales as a company now start in a digital fashion, and that's led by Walmart International, which is already at 20%. With the cost of everyday items still stubbornly high in too many categories, more customers and members are choosing us for the value and assortment we're known for and they're responding to the changes we've made to save them time. With this in mind, we're focusing on earning repeat business from customers who are now shopping with us more frequently than before. For example, a strong presentation throughout fresh and apparel are priorities, along with executing pickup and delivery to create a delightful experience that saves them time. And in the case of Walmart U.S., it also means selling more Walmart plus memberships. As more people look to us for value, we want them to see that the experience of shopping with us is also compelling due to the new capabilities we develop. Our app experiences around the world are a place where we introduce these newer capabilities. As our app becomes more a part of daily life for our customers and members, they find that they can do so much with it, like easily build a shopping cart, schedule a time to pick up an order or have it delivered when it's convenient for them, skip the line with scan & go or find an item in their local store. As you would expect, we're helping families stretch their dollars as we head into the holidays. The Walmart U.S. team has set the retail prices for a typical Thanksgiving meal the same as last year. We're removing inflation on a basket of traditional Thanksgiving food items, including whole turkeys for under $1 per pound. The members' dollar's going further at Sam's Club, too, with racks of lamb and lobster tails priced more than 40% lower than last year. We're also making the everyday shopping trip better by lowering the price of the cafe hot dog combo by nearly 10% to $1.38. Around the world, our teams have this type of mindset. In Mexico, we've widened the price gaps in our popular Bodega format by 100 basis points this year. It's incredible value at a time when customers need it most. We're finding creative ways to relieve pressure for families across our merchandise categories and countries. I'm proud of how our associates continue to step up. We're grateful for how they've navigated our inventory challenges this year and continued to prioritize the customer and member experience while doing so. During my store club and DC visits, they inspire me by the way they work together, the way they serve others and how they're embracing change and contributing ideas to improve our business. Looking ahead, we updated our outlook for the year on results from Q3, yet we remain balanced in our approach to the rest of Q4 and next year. Inflation is being especially stubborn in some categories like dry grocery. Living with high prices through this year has a cumulative impact on our customers, especially for those that are most budget-conscious, and so we're focused on bringing our costs and prices down as quickly as possible by item and category. Regardless of income levels, families are more price-conscious now. So it's as important as ever that we earn their trust with value. In just a minute, John David will share more about the guidance we gave this morning. We're working to position ourselves to succeed regardless of demand levels through value and experience we offer and the way we're positioning inventory and expenses. We're into the details, business by business. This is not a time to paint with a broad brush. We're focused on the things we can control. We delivered good expense leverage during the quarter across our segments. Strong sales growth helps, but we're also doing a good job of managing costs, and we're doing it in a sustainable way. We can keep costs in line and continue to invest in our people and technology, including supply chain automation, and continue to deliver value for customers, members and shareholders. We've made good progress to improve our inventory position. Globally, inventory is up 13% for the quarter, including 12.4% for Walmart U.S. and 2.5% for International. Inflation drives the majority of the increase rather than units. In-stock on replenishable items and active management of seasonal item quantities and sell-throughs are the priorities. We expect this progress to continue through the fourth quarter and that will end the year in even better shape. Our merchants have taken an item-by-item, category-by-category approach to match inventory with demand. We've worked through a unique period in history as we chased inventory in 2020 and 2021 and were too heavy in some general merchandise categories this year. Given where inflation remains and that economic uncertainty seems higher than normal, the quantity choice our merchants make is even more crucial than in a more normal time back when there was such a thing as a more normal time. We can be more aggressive on shorter lead time items like food and consumables, but we're especially sensitive to quantity decisions on longer-lead time items that are imported. We're thankful to have so many experienced and talented merchants. They've accomplished a lot these past few quarters. Just like John, Kath, Judith and the rest of the team have done, they've demonstrated good judgment and a lot of hustle. Our flywheel continues to take shape. We're scaling our newer businesses and connecting them to our larger, established retail businesses, primarily by how we design digital interactions. One example is how our growth in e-commerce, especially the Marketplace, fuels our ad business. More items and sellers drive GMV and improved customer satisfaction. And it also drives success in advertising, they're mutually reinforcing. If we double-click on advertising with Walmart Connect in the U.S., we see it's benefiting from growth in e-commerce and from improvements made within the business itself, and we've seen strong growth in return on ad spend over last year. In turn, this helped drive the highest ad spend all year for sponsored search in Q3. These improvements underscore Connect's strengths and position the business for continued growth. We also continue to see strong growth with Flipkart Ads in India. Like much of what we're doing, advertising is working for us globally because we have something unique to offer media buyers, and these businesses create momentum for each other. As with advertising, growing our Marketplace business also unlocks fulfillment services opportunities through both fulfillment centers and last-mile delivery. We're scaling these businesses in the U.S., and we're starting to ramp up in Mexico and Canada. The team in Mexico increased the number of sellers on our Marketplace by 20% during the quarter. In the U.S., the Marketplace on Walmart.com now offers about 370 million SKUs. That's an increase of more than 50% from Q2. Many of these sellers want to leverage our fulfillment network. They also want to use our advertising capabilities to drive demand, and we're making that easier for them. We recently shared that all new Marketplace sellers in the U.S. will be automatically onboarded onto our self-service ad platform. We believe this seamless integration will help both businesses scale even faster. What you see in our results is that we can run compelling stores and clubs, scale a first- and third-party e-commerce business and connect them together in an omnichannel fashion that saves customers and members money and time. Our strategy unlocks growth opportunities for us in a thread that runs from digital retail to fulfillment and advertising and opens up even more opportunities with health and wellness and financial services. This quarter demonstrates, again, that we can navigate short-term challenges and build for the long term simultaneously. It's been my experience over all these years that Walmart is a well-positioned business and is inherently hedged. When times are good, we have room to grow. When things are more difficult, we sell things people want and need at a value and in ways they want to shop. And with new levers for growth across our flywheel, we're becoming even stronger and more resilient. I'll close today by saying thank you for your interest in our company. We like the momentum we are creating in our business, and we recognize the need for a balanced approach in the near term given continued strains on our customers and members. Our team is focused and alert. Happy holidays, everybody. Here's John David. John David : Thanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter. I will focus my comments on the themes Doug mentioned. First, our sales momentum and share gains. Second, operational actions we're taking to improve inventory and supply chain. Third, progress we're making to further connect our alternative value streams to our core business. And lastly, our guidance for the balance of the year. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations due to sales upside with operating expense leverage across all 3 business segments. While we're encouraged by our position and our confidence in our business remains high, the macro backdrop remains challenging as persistent inflation is impacting the consumer and our business. As I discuss our results, it's important to note the charges related to the opioid legal settlement framework affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q3 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items. Total constant currency revenue grew 9.8% as our omni model and strong value proposition continue to resonate with customers during this period of broad inflationary pressures. Each of our segments delivered strong sales results. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated sequentially to 8.2% growth with increases in average ticket size as well as transactions. Constant currency sales in Walmart International were strong, up 13.3% led by Flipkart and Walmex, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 10.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco. Our purpose of saving people money has never been more important as inflation remains consistently high. High fuel prices and mid-teens food inflation have forced consumers to manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We continue to manage pricing in a way that preserves our price gaps while gaining market share profitably. Walmart is well positioned to serve customers and gain greater trip frequency during tougher economic periods, and we have even more tools to do so in this cycle. For example, we've continued to gain grocery market share from households across income demographics, with nearly three quarters of the share gain coming from those exceeding $100,000 in annual income. This quarter, our private brand penetration in food categories increased about 130 basis points, reflecting customers' increased focus on quality products at value prices. We observed incremental trade down in categories, including proteins, baking goods, baby and dog food. We're working hard to keep prices low and help ease the burden to make customers' lives better. This includes working with vendors to reduce product cost and minimize inflation impacts on final goods' pricing. Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points. More than half of the decline was due to markdowns and sales mix in the U.S. The remaining headwind reflects a $113 million LIFO charge at Sam's Club due to inflation and the timing of sales events in International, including Flipkart's Big Billion Days. Notably, the rate of decline in gross margin improved from 2Q as inventory remediation efforts are progressing. We've been very targeted in reducing certain categories of inventory in our system and our actions included cancelling orders and increasing the level of markdowns. The team has done a really good job addressing our inventory situation, as reflected by Q3 inventory being up only 13% versus last year, including 12.4% growth in Walmart U.S. In aggregate, this level represents a more than 10 percentage point improvement versus the end of Q2. Notably, about 70% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. We feel good about our ability to sell through the majority of this in Q4 and expect continued year-over-year improvement even when including the effects of inflation. We saw stronger expense leverage this quarter as selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 75 basis points due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID cost. We're focused on what we can control and continue to work down inventory levels and manage general and administrative expenses tightly. Taking all this together, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis increased 4.6%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.66 but adjusted EPS was $1.50. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.11 impact from unrealized losses on equity investments, primarily JD.com and a $1.05 charge related to the opioid litigation settlement framework. We're pleased that our adjusted EPS outperformed the guidance we provided in August due primarily to better operating expense leverage on higher sales across the business. Operating cash flow for the year-to-date period decreased $600 million to $15.7 billion primarily due to the timing of certain payments and a decrease in operating income, partially offset by moderated inventory purchases. During the quarter, we returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. We're committed to continuing to provide strong cash returns to shareholders while still appropriately investing in our business for the long term. And our Board has just approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization that we expect to utilize over the next several years. Let me briefly reference key highlights by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales momentum accelerated in Q3 with a 2-year stack of 17.4%, up 570 basis points from Q2. Monthly sales gains were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. Food sales continued to lead with mid-teens growth. We're particularly encouraged to see year-over-year growth in food units sold after experiencing a slight decline last quarter. We also continue to make good progress on improving in-stock levels in our grocery business despite the heavy volumes we're experiencing. Inflation remained high, up mid-teens percentage in food categories reflecting an 80 basis point step-up compared to levels at the end of Q2. We've seen incremental levels of inflation month-over-month be less significant, but it's not clear if this represents a sustainable trend. However, we believe our strong price positioning is contributing to share gains as we attract value-seeking customers across the household income spectrum. General merchandise sales declined low single digits with softness in electronics, home and apparel. E-commerce accelerated sequentially to 16% growth, even as store transactions continued to grow. We experienced strength in pickup and delivery from stores, Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising. Gross profit rate decreased 77 basis points due primarily to higher markdowns and product mix headwinds, but the team delivered strong SG&A expense leverage of 60 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs. As a result, we delivered better-than-expected operating income growth of nearly 5%. Walmart International delivered strong sales results, with sales up 13.3% in constant currency despite continued macro headwinds. E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis were exceptionally strong. up 46% in the quarter. The earlier timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event was also a benefit to sales results. Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $1.5 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, led by a great quarter from Walmex, with comp sales growth of 11.7%, reflecting strong performance in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs and 17% growth in e-commerce. In China, comp sales were up 5.6%, reflecting strong e-commerce growth as well as strength at Sam's Club. E-commerce sales grew 63% and penetration reached 41% of sales. Canada comp sales increased more than 5%. And in October, we launched Walmart fulfillment services in Canada, where sellers of all sizes on the digital Marketplace can now contract with us to take care of their inventory storage and logistics needs. The new offering will provide faster shipping of customer orders within a 2-day window to 95% of Canadians. In India, Flipkart had a great quarter with strong customer response to our Big Billion Days event, which moved forward into Q3 this year from Q4 last year. We had over 1 billion visits to our site during the 8-day event and, importantly, saw more than 60% of those customers coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. PhonePe also continues to perform well with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, now over $920 billion and reaching a record level of monthly transactions to about $3.6 billion. This was the first time PhonePe had a quarter with more than 10 billion transactions. International segment operating income was better than expected and increased 3.2% in constant currency, led by Walmex in China. In Sam's Club U.S., we had another strong quarter with comp sales up more than 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and an increase of more than 25% on a 2-year stack. Both comp transactions and average ticket increased about 5%. And e-commerce sales grew 20% with strength in curb side orders and ship to home. Membership income was up 8% with another record high quarter in overall member counts, at an all-time high, plus member penetration. Sam's leveraged expenses 68 basis points due primarily to higher sales. This helped offset a decline in gross profit rate due primarily to a 53 basis point or $113 million inflation-related LIFO charge. For the quarter, Sam's operating income increased more than 18% with fuel and nearly 8% excluding fuel and including the impact of the LIFO charge. Combining these results with my comments about International, you can see Sam's Club is performing well around the world, and we're pleased with the leverage we see across markets with Member's Mark as an example. As we navigate changes to our external environment, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives that were enabled by our omnichannel retail capabilities. Globally, as we're building a larger e-commerce business, we're scaling our Marketplace which unlocks and strengthens our fulfillment and advertising businesses and expands the number of families that choose to be members. Across our segments, e-commerce is enabling deeper engagement with customers and members that helps drive strategic growth in our alternative value streams. New sellers in our U.S. Marketplace are contributing to our advertising growth and we added more than 8,000 sellers in Q3. Third-party build-out helps diversify and strengthen our product assortment, which now includes more than 370 million SKUs. Strong digital advertising growth continued this quarter, increasing over 30% on a global basis, led by 40% growth in Walmart Connect in the U.S. and Flipkart Ads in India. As we focus on membership, our ability to leverage our data improves, so we continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering, Walmart Luminate, and the number of Walmart plus memberships continues to grow. We gained some of these new Walmart plus members after expanding our last mile delivery capabilities through a fourfold increase since January and the number of pickup points serviced by the Spark Driver platform. We're making good progress in fulfillment and automation. The Spark Driver platform now serves customers in all 50 states for more than 10,000 pickup points with the ability to reach 84% of all U.S. households. This coverage includes a growing revenue stream from businesses utilizing Walmart GoLocal, our delivery as a service offering, has already made over 1 million deliveries since launching last year. Building Walmart fulfillment services in the U.S., Mexico and now also in Canada has been an important asset in growing our seller base as they seek an integrated omni sales and fulfillment solution. For example, almost 30% of orders on Walmex' marketplace are now being fulfilled using Walmart fulfillment services which was launched a year ago. In September, we opened a next-gen fulfillment center in Illinois. This 1.1 million square foot facility features robotics, machine learning and automated storage, resulting in increased productivity and a better service for our customers at faster delivery times. And last week, we acquired Alert Innovation as we expand our market fulfillment center build-out. MFCs are positioned inside or attached to Walmart super-centers and use robotics and AI to fill online orders more quickly. We're putting the building blocks in place to deliver powerful, mutually reinforcing ecosystem that not only benefits customers and partners, but also shareholders, with more durable and diversified earnings streams. Turning to guidance. In this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we are well equipped to continue gaining market share in an environment where consumers need to stretch their dollars further. We will continue to advocate for customers and work with our supplier partners to maintain strong price gaps and deliver lower relative pricing versus competitors. We're also navigating real inflation on our own cost structure and continue to seek ways to reduce cost and improve leverage potential. With these considerations in mind, we're maintaining a balanced approach to our guidance. incorporating a cautious view on the consumer together with our confidence in our ability to execute. We're updating fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the Q3 upside and leaving our sales and profit assumptions for Q4 unchanged. Despite a good start to Q4, our guidance assumes that the consumer could slow spending, especially in general merchandise categories, given persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables. Our guidance provides flexibility to compete in a promotional environment, accounts for pricing action to reduce remaining excess inventory and anticipates ongoing mix pressure. For Q4, we expect net sales growth of about 3%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S., with food and consumables growth continuing to outpace general merchandise. We expect year-over-year operating income within a range of a 1% increase to a 1% decrease. And adjusted EPS is expected to decrease 3% to 5%, including higher year-over-year tax and interest expenses. For the full year, incorporating the Q3 upside, we now expect net sales growth of about 5.5%, including comp sales growth of 5.5% for Walmart U.S. On an adjusted basis, we expect operating income to decline 6.5% to 7.5% and EPS to decline 6% to 7%. Excluding the effect of divestitures and on an adjusted basis, this would translate into net sales growth of 6.5% and a decline in operating income of 5.5% to 6.5% and a decline in EPS of 5% to 6%. Looking beyond Q4, we know some of the unanticipated costs experienced this year shouldn't repeat next year. That said, we're planning our business with the assumption that inflation remains somewhat elevated. In addition, we've had significant currency headwinds this year. Based on year-to-date results and current FX rates, we estimate a year-over-year sales headwind for this fiscal year of $4.1 billion from currency and a potential sales headwind of about $3 billion next year. Also, as we've had $236 million in LIFO charges this year at Sam's Club, we're likely to experience LIFO charges in Walmart U.S. as well next year. Based on current assumptions, these LIFO charges next year for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club could approximate roughly $1 billion of gross profit headwind. It's important to note that inflation, inventory levels and additional factors that are challenging to predict will influence the aggregate amount. We're committed to providing you ongoing updates to the assumptions as we report our quarterly results. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : We wanted to focus on inventories. We just wondered how much remains from the spring inventory, how you would describe your in-stocks for Q4 versus last year. And you also mentioned you'd be aggressive in some places when it came to inventories. Is that just in the shorter lead time categories? Or can it be anywhere else? Doug McMillon : We should answer that question across all 3 segments. But John, why don't you go first? John Furner : Sure. Kate, a couple of things on inventory. First, I think the team here and the merchants, supply chain teams have done a really nice job improving the year-on-year results from second quarter into the end of third quarter. As we said earlier, up about 12.4%. That's down from just over 26% in the second quarter. The first thing I think is important to consider, if you look back over the quarters of the year, in Q1 when we were the highest, the majority of the extra inventory was in supply chain and part of the backlog problem, then the second quarter that balanced more evenly between stores and the total, and in this quarter, at the end of Q3, what we see is an increase of 12.4%, but the stores are still heavy. So the inventory has moved from the supply chain to a balanced and now it's in the store. And when you look at the dollar amount that's up, about 70% of it, 3/4 of it roughly is inflation and the rest we can approximate to pretty significant improvements in in-stock over last year. Last year, we were quite low. So we see a really recent improvement in in-stock. And then specifically on your last question, probably around something just under $1 billion, around $1 billion would be what will we consider excess. That's down pretty significantly, about a third of where we were at the end of Q2. So we're making improvements. Apparel and certain categories in GM are the heavy categories, and we'll continue to work through those. And just a reminder, we said at the beginning of Q1, we needed a couple of quarters to work through the inventory and we continue to do that. And then John David did mention in his commentary that there is room in our forecast to continue making progress on inventory. But I was in an import center last week, and the inbound is in really good shape. The orders are in line. So I think the team have done a really nice job adjusting to the end of the year. Judith McKenna : Yes. For International, we're up just 2.5% for the quarter. While there's some helpful tailwinds in that from currency, the underlying quarter-on-quarter has reduced over the last 3 quarters, and we're in a pretty healthy shape across all of the markets around the world. Of course, there are a couple of pockets here and there that we'll continue to focus on as we go through Q4. But I'm actually really pleased from an in-stock level, because last holiday season, we definitely had areas where we were light. And I'm encouraged to see each market being in a good place going through to this holiday season. Kath McLay : Yes. And from a Sam's perspective, our inventory is up 36%. I think 50% of that increase is actually being in-stock to your question. So as Doug and John David talked about, we've had 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit comp growth. We have been chasing in-stock for the last 2.5 years, and we're in -- we're finally in a great position from an in-stock going into the -- into the holiday event period. So strong in-stock, 50% of it. 30% of it is inflation. And the rest is kind of some big bets we did going into kind of Christmas. So we're really happy with the quality of our inventory and kind of leaning forward into the rest of the year. Doug McMillon : Kate, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. I would just point out that we handle inventory and think about inventory in 2 different categories. The first category is replenishable merchandise, where we want to be in-stock all the time. We -- even though we were heavy in inventory through the course of this year so far, we did not let up on trying to get in-stock on replenishable goods and wouldn't want to do that. That second category of non-replenishable items, which are often features, we're managing that aggressively category by category and don't want to get too conservative. There are some places where we should still play offense through this quarter and into next year. And then lastly, I think it was appropriate for us the last couple of quarters to break out how much inventory we wish we didn't have. That number is getting down to the point where we probably won't be talking about that going forward, because we always have some inventory we don't want, even in a more normal circumstance. So we've made a lot of progress, feeling a lot better about it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Bob Drbul : Just following up a little bit on the inventory side. A couple of things. Can you talk about sort of the vendor reception to reducing product costs that you mentioned on the call? And I guess, the other piece of this is, I think it was $1 billion LIFO charge or the expectation. Can you just talk about your assumptions around inflation over the coming quarters and what the offsets are as you think about that as we proceed throughout the next year? Doug McMillon : I'll take the supplier question first. we're not really changing what we've always done. We are trying to find ways with our current suppliers to get costs down, provide value to customers and members, and we're trying to be creative about it. And in some instances, some suppliers are more aggressive than others, and we welcome that. And we're going to try to do the best job we can category by category, item by item of getting prices down as we head through next year. That's been consistent. That's the way we always behave, and there's not really anything different as it relates to that. John David : Sure, Bob. This is John, David. I'll take the LIFO aspect of your question. First, I'd say the core business is continuing to perform pretty well in the face of a difficult macro environment. But we do have headwinds next year, as we called out, both currency as well as the LIFO charge. The LIFO charge is a result of the inflationary environment that we're in, and it's heavily dependent upon what our inflation and inventory assumptions are next year. For planning purposes, we're basically assuming that prices stay where they are. The result on a year-over-year basis from an inflation perspective would be a little north of 3%, it's a little greater than 3%. And to the extent that, that changes, that affects that $1 billion estimate. But I think it's important to note that to the extent that we get back to a deflationary retail cost environment, this $1 billion headwind actually reverses out as a benefit in latter periods. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Robbie Ohmes : Great quarter. Just actually I had 2 questions. One, just a follow-up. I think, Doug, you might have mentioned a strong start to the fourth quarter. The others have sort of mentioned maybe a slower start to the holiday shopping season because of the [indiscernible] last year. And I was just curious if you could give any color on if you're seeing any of that kind of behavior. And then my second question, just a separate question, which is private label was called out. Could -- can you all remind us the private label capabilities at Walmart U.S. and how much that could grow from here? Doug McMillon : As it relates to the strong start, Robbie, this is Doug, and then I'll toss it to John. The quarter just started, and as John David said in his remarks, we're trying to build in some conservatism. I think the fact that we're strong in food and consumables is relevant here, and we mentioned that annual event activity that we've experienced so far is in the range of what we would expect generally. So it's just early days, we'll see how the rest of the quarter goes. John Furner : Robbie, let me talk about private brand, but more broadly first, we want to be positioned for customers whatever they want, whenever they want it between the stores, pickup, delivery, e-commerce, Walmart InHome, we're prepared and positioned well to serve a variety of customers. And that would include merchandise strategies like private brand. And we've been pretty open over the years that we don't necessarily manage private brand to a specific target, but what we do in private brand is develop great quality items and great values and then we are there for customers in whatever situation that they're in. And we've seen some customers this year trade into private brands more than they did in the previous year. That's not necessarily true of all customers. Customers shop differently, depending on the position that they're in. And one of the things John David said that's important is a large percentage, the majority of our share gains in the last quarter have come from high-end customers. So we want to be ready to serve customers with great quality, great value, private brand items. We also want to be able to serve customers well with premium items. And we definitely see that in channels like e-commerce and pickup. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Corey Tarlowe : Congratulations on the strong quarter. So I have a two-part question, first on International for Judith and second on Sam's Club for Kath. So firstly, on International, net sales were up a strong 13%. I know you highlighted Flipkart. But can you further unpack maybe what drove that growth and what you see driving continued success in this segment ahead? And then secondly, on Sam's Club, I believe the company has driven close to 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit comp growth or close to 3 years. What do you attribute this continued and consistent growth to? And how should we be thinking about this momentum as we head into holiday and next year? And then could you also touch a little bit on how you're seeing memberships trend? I know you mentioned that there's an uptick there that continues to be strong as memberships are reaching record levels. Judith McKenna : Yes. Let me start with the International business, and thank you for the question. Yes, we saw a really strong quarter for international at 13%. Sales growth was encouraging. The real stories in here are that we are really starting to see the benefits of the diversification and portfolio work that we did over the last few years. That's led us to being able to focus where it matters across the International portfolio. And I'm definitely seeing the benefit of that as we look across the last couple of quarters of growth and profitability that we've seen. For the quarter specifically, maybe 2 markets to call out. We called out Flipkart, but to give you a little bit of color on that. The Big Billion Days event fell into Q3 for this year. It was in Q4 last year. That created some kind of differences in our results between Q3 and Q4, which we've called out. But that is an event which is designed to try to bring new customers onboard for Flipkart. And it looks to have been successful in doing that again. A billion visits over the 8 days of the event shows you the amount of traffic that, that generates and those customers shopping many of them for the first time. So Flipkart continues to meet our expectations, and we've been pleased with the quarter. The other market I would call out is Mexico. So a really strong result from Mexico. They saw double-digit sales growth and strong profit growth as well. What's really encouraging there is not only their focus on their core business, but equally the focus that they're having on building up solutions for customers across their ecosystem. So their cash e-payment business that bites telecom business, the emerging health care businesses are all helping drive that customer connectivity back into the business. And they're proving to be a real powerhouse for the International segment. Across the other markets, maybe the only other market that I would highlight is China, which leads the way from an e-commerce perspective. So our e-commerce penetration for the quarter was 23%. But we also saw in China a 41% e-commerce penetration, and we're learning a lot from that market about how to deal with those kind of volumes, of deliveries and e-commerce as well in Sam's Club and is a real great format therefore in sharing much of the private brand and much of the innovation that Sam's Club in the U.S. is bringing through. I think it is that focus on the core business, making sure that our omnichannel capabilities around the world that are strong and also in looking at how we can make sure that we build out these ecosystems which are mutually reinforcing is what will help drive us for the future, too. Kath McLay : And thank you for the question about Sam's growth. I think we have a pretty simple flywheel that's been sitting at the heart of driving the growth over the last 3 years. And it all starts with creating a member-obsessed culture. If you do that, you can't help but create items and services that members love. If you create items members love, you can buy deep and get cost advantages that you pass on to the member. And if you have great items at disruptive prices and you open up the channels of access like Judith talked about, then you can't help but drive membership income. And as we've driven that, we've been able to take some of the funds back and invest it in our associates to then help create this member-obsessed culture. And that is the flywheel that's just been fueling the 11 quarters of double-digit comp. I think as you kind of look at that, you can also see our membership income has been up kind of high single digits over the -- kind of over the 3-year period as well. And so it's really just reinforcing flywheel. If you think about Member's Mark, our Member's Mark item is actually made with and for our members. So we have 40,000 members who give us counsel on the items before we launch them to market, which means that they always launch successfully and we end up with about a 4.2 star rating minimum on our Member's Mark items. That's creating items that members love and they ensure that they're successful when they're launched. That's part of the magic that's sitting in that growth of 11 quarters. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Wanted to just talk a little bit about the general merchandise business at Walmart U.S. Just curious how you think you're performing on that side from a market share perspective and if there's strategies to better leverage the very strong traffic on the grocery side of the business. And also, just how do you think the promotional activity continued -- or contributed to the performance there? Because it looks like some of the categories that did perform well, lawn and garden, automotive, were maybe the categories that were not quite as promotional. But maybe you could just help us understand how that played out in the quarter? John Furner : First, I think something you said that is really important, the traffic that comes from food and consumables is where a lot of our shopping journeys begin. And over the last few years, we've positioned the business to have a strong online pickup delivery business from stores, which includes an omnichannel approach, which enables customers to shop the entire business any way that they want to. In the last quarter specifically, I think there's been really good progress with a number of items that have come on to the Marketplace, including the number of sellers. The offering has grown pretty significantly just in the last quarter. The count of item's up about 50% which positions us well in categories like apparel as we look forward and also other strong categories like home. On the share point, I think the categories you mentioned, in one of our reports would show share gains and others, we feel pretty good about the overall market share remaining in a positive position through the quarter. So for the next 3 months, we're really focused on delivering and executing well for all of our customers. There will be a lot of holiday spending as people prepare for gifts. Doug mentioned earlier that our first annual event was basically in line with expectations. But there's a lot of daylight between now and the end of the quarter, still 75 days to go. So we're really focused on the next few weeks as we lead into December and get ready for the holiday period. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Two-part question. First, on the third quarter. You had set it up conservatively and this came in much better. Can you talk about what's changed? Is it clearing of inventory? Inflation definitely picked up but your transactions did, too. And maybe -- it seems like you have some pricing power. And then the second question is maybe to John David, the timing of LIFO. Is it -- a lot of companies experienced a lot of LIFO pressure during '22 because of how high inflation was. Why has it lagged? Is it because you lagged, the pricing that led, grew into your price? Is it other -- is there some other dynamic with LIFO that you had some reserves? Anyway, just wondering why it's hitting you next year. John David : Sure, Simeon. I'll take both those pieces. On 3Q, I think there's a couple of things that stand out in terms of the performance relative to our guidance. First is, as we talked about it in our prepared remarks, we gained share during the period, which in this time of high inflation that's putting pressure on the consumers, it shows that our value proposition is more relevant than ever. At the same time, there's also been an extreme focus on the expense side of the business. And so you see that we leveraged by almost 80 basis points in the quarter as we're continuing to focus on providing the best products to our customers but in the most efficient way that we can. And so those will be the two areas that I would call out that are most notable in terms of the outperformance. With respect to LIFO, what we've experienced this year with the over $200 million of LIFO charges has been entirely related to Sam's. Sam's uses the weighted average cost method for their inventory accounting. Walmart uses RIM, a retail inventory method. And so there's a slight nuance difference there that results in the lag. But our expectation, given that we think that these prices will persist, is that Walmart U.S. will then -- will soon begin incurring these charges as well. In terms of the timing of next year, it's more front-loaded than the back half of the year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Grom : Congrats to the team. Doug, in your prepared remarks, you said customers that came to us less frequently in the past are now shopping with us more often. Can you flesh that comment out -- comment out a little bit more for us. I think it's interesting. I'm curious the time frame that you're speaking to. And then regionally, just curious if there was any call-outs in the quarter, particularly in California with the rebate checks paid out in the month of October. Doug McMillon : Yes. I'll respond to the first one, and then John, you can help. As it relates to customers shopping with us more frequently, this share gain with people making more than $100,000 household income is what I was referring to. As you would expect, just about everybody, if I think about the U.S., it's probably true in Mexico and other places, too, shops at Walmart at some point. A lot of people may come to us for Tide or come to us for bananas, but they may not buy a T-shirt or a sweater. We've got really high market shares in some general merchandise categories which would tell you a lot of America shops at Walmart. And during a period of time when people are more sensitive to price, it makes sense that they would increase the amount of their wallet that would be coming to Walmart because of value. So that's what's happening. So that leads you to the second question, which is can you keep them? And I think some of the things John mentioned a minute ago, like pickup and delivery help. But as I mentioned in my remarks, fresh food and apparel are other areas, home's another one, where if we can stand tall during this period of time, we think they'll keep coming back to us because we do have quality, we do have value and we've created a lot more ways for them to save time in the store and we pick up in delivery. So that's what we're out to do. John Furner : Yes, exactly right. Chuck, yes, the business has really positioned itself to be an omni business. So we are ready for customers however they want to shop. Certainly, I would just repeat that in higher income customer groups, we're seeing more and more often. We're also seeing more digital engagements with customers, more app demos, more users, people shopping more frequently. And I think that speaks to the strength of the flexibility of what we've built. And for a long time, we talked about the value of a store customer plus shopping on e-com, how much more valuable that was. We see that accelerate when it's pickup, e-commerce and stores. So going forward, you'll hear us talk about this more and more as an omni offer which is really flexible for the customer and doing things like having options for Thanksgiving meal that are priced the same as last year are really helpful at a time when customers are feeling the pressure of inflation. And then the last thing, regionally, no real differences to report in the third quarter across the geographies. We saw strength in many geographies. So I wouldn't say that there's anything that would be a real standout in terms of one region being much stronger than others. The formats were strong across the board, and we saw consistency throughout the quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : I have two questions. First for Doug. At the start of your prepared remarks, Doug, you mentioned that you're aiming to bring down prices for consumers. As we move into next year, it's likely that some of the pressures that caused all the inflation in consumer goods will start to recede. How is Walmart going to handle that? Could you actually see prices come down? And that's important given that Walmart tends to be the price-setter across a lot of consumer goods, and you're going to have this growing pool of alternative profit from what you can actually support lower prices into next year. And then my follow-up question is for John David. John David, you provided a couple of lease parameters for how to think about 2023 between the $1 billion LIFO headwind to gross margin and the $3 billion of FX drag to sales next year. Does that mean we should expect that 2023 is going to be a sub algo year for Walmart of achieving 4% top line growth and 4.5% operating income growth? And then you'll get that back in 2024 and some of those headwinds we see such that the combination of those two years should produce the algorithm. Doug McMillon : Yes, Michael, this is Doug. The algorithm is the first thing that came to mind when you asked the question about how we'll approach prices. The 4% and greater than 4% numbers are certainly on our mind, and that indicates that we think we can grow the operating income percentage of the company over time. As we navigate next year, that will be one factor that we're thinking about. Obviously, we'll be thinking about customers and members as well and driving top line and growing share. So we'll be navigating it basically week to week, month to month as things change. And commodities like protein categories have already started to respond. They moved quickly based on demand, there'll be volatility in categories like fresh food. The general merchandise categories have started to move as demand softens. And things like transportation cost change. We've seen some downward movement in general merchandise. And I think that will continue by the guess in the next year to some degree. And we'll manage margins in a price gap in general merchandise department by department, category by category as we always do, but have an eye towards leading down while protecting profitability as much as we can. I think dry grocery and consumables will be more stubborn. Wage rates have gone up, and that won't change. And some input costs have been high for those categories. That's the area where we need to partner even more with our suppliers and come up with more creative solutions and try to do the best we can of relieving that pressure for customers and members. When you add it all up, we'll watch our price gaps. We like where our price gaps are. As you've heard us say many times, we understand where price gaps need to be to drive our sales. And then we manage the rest of the pieces to consider operating income and return on investment. John David : Michael, with the second part of that question, while I wasn't here when we first talked about the growth algorithm, I'm quite certain that the team did not contemplate the $1 billion LIFO charge in that number or the FX headwind. So I would encourage you to think about that over a multiyear basis. That's a framework to think about the opportunity that we have in our business. We're calling that out now because it's a headwind that we recognize we're going to encounter. But shouldn't take away from the tremendous growth opportunities that we have with our changing business model, moving more to a scaled omnichannel retailer as we invest in things like Marketplace, advertising, fulfillment services. And so all of those things give us a lot of conviction that, that growth algorithm is well in place. But I would encourage you to think about that over a multiyear period. Michael Lasser : Could I clarify that one, please? If you're expecting the $1 billion headwind to gross margin from LIFO in, let's say, the next two or three quarters, does that mean you would get it back in the subsequent two2 or three quarters based on everything that you know today? John David : That's the right way to think about it, Michael. I don't want to be so specific as to say the number of quarters or which quarters. But over the past, call it 35 years, we've generally been, either because of our business model of everyday low prices or just what's happening with retail prices, in general, we've generally been in a deflationary retail cost environment. We don't expect to live in this era of high inflation forever. I certainly hope not. And so if we do get back to what we've seen over the last three decades, you would expect that to reverse out in a reasonably quick time period. So this is not something that if we get back to a normal environment, it's going to take years to reverse out. So what you said is generally correct. I can't be so specific as to be, say, which quarters they're going to happen though. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Just a couple of quick ones. First, just John David, maybe you guys -- you talked a lot about the flywheel new capabilities. Understanding that those are all integrated into the business in different ways, how should we be thinking about the impact that can have on the business, either currently or over the next few years? Any way you can help us frame that? And then the second question is just around the trade down and the increase in private brand penetration. Just curious how the pace and magnitude of that shift that you guys are seeing compares to maybe past periods where we've had economic stress? Is it similar? Is it happening more acutely? Just those are my two questions. John David : Sure. I'll take the first part of that and then pass it on to John for the second part of the question. One of the things, Peter, that excites me the most about this business is the opportunity that we have going forward with a changing business model that is really reflective of where consumers -- consumer patterns are shifting to. We see in the world move more online. I think we are unique in our ability to be a skilled omnichannel retailer. And so when you consider things like advertising or fulfillment services, these are areas of our business that not only are faster-growing, they have a higher margin associated with them. And so that's included when we contemplate our growth algorithm. So hopefully, we look up a number of years from now and we've got a much more diverse and durable earnings stream that also there's a different multiple ascribed to those earning streams than what exists today. We're quite excited about the opportunity in front of us. John Furner : And Peter, it's John. I'll just talk about private brand for a second. What we've seen really for the last three years up until Q1 of this year was a flat private brand penetration, not much movement in '19, 2021. And then the movement, the trading to private brands from other brands really started in about March of this year. And then as we said in the quarter, it's increased its penetration in the food categories by about 130 basis points. So a relatively decent amount has moved into private brands. As far as comparisons to prior periods, I think the last time we would be able to say anything about this is probably 12 to 13 years ago. So I don't think I have anything today to offer with specificity other than what we've seen in the last three quarters is quite a bit of switching amongst some consumers. Now there are other consumers that are trading to Walmart that are not trading in private brands. They're branded customers and they're buying more premium items. So again, I would just repeat the fact that we positioned ourselves in terms of merchandising in the portfolio and with the channels by which we serve customers in a very flexible way so that we can help customers in whatever economic situation they're in and we'll be ready for the rest of the year. Doug McMillon : I think what you guys have done on the Thanksgiving meal is a great example of how we're helping relieve pressure. There, Peter, a group of items that make up kind of the scratch cooking aspects of Thanksgiving, 25 items for $88, the same as last year, that's one basket. We've looked at Thanksgiving baskets in different ways and taking other actions on products that are more convenient, not scratched, like our $71 for 17 different items. That alleviates the need to switch. These are -- some of these are branded items. I think that's a great example of how we can step up and absorb some of this to help families that need it most. And I'm really pleased to see you guys take that action. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : So I guess I wanted to get back to the idea of next year and what Michael was talking about with the inflation receding. I guess the big wildcard in that is if we get a big inflation going away, where does demand -- underlying demand would suggest maybe underlying demand is being destroyed potentially. And so how do you guys think of your business if we move through that type of environment? John David : Sure. I'll start and others can jump in. This is John David. Look, one of the biggest impacts in our business this year has been the change in mix, particularly as we think about the U.S. business, where the margin profile is different on general merchandise versus food and consumables. We don't have an assumption that, that bounces back rapidly next year. And with continued high prices, the consumer continuing to be pressured, we expect to have that mix effect effects prolong into next year. So I know there's hope that things would bounce back. And certainly, some of the onetime costs that we've incurred this year related to supply chain are not going to repeat next year, but the consumer is stressed. One of the things that's assisted that thus far is relatively strong balance sheets among consumers assisted by stimulus payments. That's not going to last forever. So that's why we take a rather cautious view on the consumer. But at the same time, as all of us have mentioned, this is when our value proposition really shines, when customers are looking for value. And it's not just value, it's also product assortment. One of the things that John mentioned, and I think it's worth repeating, but it's not just the 370 million SKUs that we're offering between first-party and third-party e-commerce, it's the acceleration of that. That's a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter. And it shows you that not only are we providing products at the price point that customers want, we're providing additional products and assortment for them to buy. John Furner : Scott, the thing I would add, and I agree what John David said, really 3 parts of this. First, we have to focus on what we can control in any environment. And that would consist of great merchants, positioning our sales for value, which is relative value and taking a longer-term approach to the consumer; and then finally, strong execution. We've made some progress with inventory, as we said, quarter-to-quarter, from high 20s to just over 12% over the last year. So having an inventory position that's strong going into the year with some flexibility is a really important part to be able to manoeuvre any environment that we get into. So we'll continue to focus on those three, and we'll be ready for customers in any scenario that we find ourselves in, in the next couple of years. Scott Mushkin : So as a follow-up up to that, John, like if you look at the U.S. business ex LIFO, do you anticipate EBIT growth? John David : We're not prepared to give guidance for next year yet. We'll talk about that more on the fourth quarter call. Doug McMillon : So a really good try, though, Scott. We were all tempted to jump in and say something, but I think John David gave you the appropriate answer. Operator : Our final question today comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez : Just curious, you mentioned again seeing a higher-income consumer trading into your store. I'm curious that you're seeing them shop other parts of your store outside of food and grocery. Are you seeing them show up in general merchandise? And I'm kind of curious, just as you look out to the competitive environment for holiday, what do you expect in terms of the promotional cadence out there? And maybe just talk about the opportunities that you have for holiday this year as well as challenges. John Furner : Hey, Paul. What's exciting about the rest of the season is we still have a couple of big events this month. We're excited about Thanksgiving next week because of the way we prepared in the food business. And then we have an event in December that we're looking forward to as well. The customers that are trading into the brand, as I said earlier, it's a mix, which is great. We're seeing more customers more often. We're seeing them in more categories. Historically, in the last quarter, we do see a lot of new customers who come in via food and consumables. And then through the digital experience, what we did over the last really 12 months was integrate the original Walmart grocery shopping app and the Walmart.com app into one place. So the entire assortment, up to 350-plus million items, are all there in one place. So I think we're positioned well to be able to navigate. As far as promotions, as we said earlier, the guidance would include the ability to react to a more promotional environment, but we don't know yet. It's still mid-November, and there's a lot of room between now and the end of the holidays, including New Year. So again, we'll be prepared for any environment that emerges over the next few weeks. Doug McMillon : More promotional than normal. Late -- some seasons are later than others. Christmas is a day later. This will be one of those years where we're watching sales closely up until the last minute of Christmas Eve. And then we'll do a lot of business after Christmas. We don't finish until January 31. And sometimes these quarters work out where the very end of December and January end up being stronger when people are particularly price-sensitive. So that's kind of what I'm expecting. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : As always, thanks for your interest in the company. We are pleased that we had a stronger quarter. I think there's a lot to look at in the metrics that we shared, we've shared a lot of information this morning, that would indicate not only are kind of the key short-term operational metrics being managed well but we are building a different business model. John David talked a bit about that in his prepared remarks. We're excited to see progress in terms of how Marketplace is scaling and how these businesses connect to each other. So we're not just focused on the short term, but we are focused on the short term as we build for the long term. The key issue has been inventory management, and I'm really thankful to have a team with a lot of experience and able to consume a lot of data to make good choices about where we position inventory by country, by category, for the rest of this quarter and into next year. I'm sure there will be some things that surprised us, but we are engineered for flexibility. And as I mentioned in my remarks, one of the things I love about this business, there's a long list of things I love, but one of the things I love are all they natural hedges. If they don't want to buy something, we'll sell them something else. If the price needs to be a little lower, we'll figure that out. If a problem needs to be dealt with, we'll deal with it, and there'll be something else going well that helps us manage the total portfolio. That's the way that I think about it. I'm excited about this holiday and the challenges in front of us, and I hope you guys have a great holiday yourselves. Thank you all. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin. Stephanie Schiller Wissink : Thank you, and welcome to our Q4 Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today from Walmart's home office in Bentonville are CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. We'll follow a similar format to prior calls, where Doug and John David will share their thoughts on the quarter, year and year ahead. Following, we'll open the call to your questions. For the Q&A portion, we've asked our segment CEOs to join, including John Furner from Walmart U.S., Judith McKenna from Walmart International and Kath McLay from Sam's Club. Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. We are now ready to begin. Doug, over to you. Doug McMillon : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're excited about our momentum. The team delivered a strong finish to the year. And as our results in the last 2 quarters show, we acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year. We built momentum in the third quarter, and that continues. We're well positioned to start this fiscal year. For fiscal '23, we added $38 billion in sales globally, and we crossed $600 billion in revenue for the first time in our company's history. Globally, e-commerce now represents more than $80 billion in sales and over 13% of our total sales. Walmart U.S. grew sales by more than $27 billion. International had another strong year with sales and profit growth of about 9%, excluding divestitures, restructuring and currency. And Sam's Club U.S. grew sales by more than $10 billion as we delivered double-digit comp growth for the third consecutive year with membership count at a record high and strong growth in membership income. All 3 segments have momentum. We're grateful to John, Judith, Kath and their teams for how they're leading these businesses and showing results. The holidays were strong for us. From Thanksgiving to Christmas to Diwali to Singles Day, our teams were ready. We had aggressive plans and we delivered. Around the world, the teams leaned into our food and consumables strength, taking share in places like the U.S. and Canada and delivered a good experience for customers and members in general merchandise. They drove sales and landed the seasons in a very good inventory position when it was all said and done. We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year, which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number. And they did it while improving in-stock levels. I'm impressed with how they brought it all together, and want to highlight our store, club and supply chain associates who handled a lot of volume to make this happen. As we navigated the short term, we also advanced our strategic priorities. Big picture, our strategy is simple. It's to bring our purpose to life for those we have the privilege to serve. We're a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer that's dedicated to helping people save money and live a better life. That's who we are. Why do we exist? It's to help people save money and live better. How do we do it? By being people-led with clear values, a unique culture and tech-powered. We're a people business focused on customers, members and associates. We're constantly adjusting to put the right combination of wages, benefits and education in place so that our people can build lifelong careers and achieve their full potential. You can start your career assembling bicycles and end up leading all of our U.S. stores. You can start as a cashier and become a truck driver. You can start unloading trucks in a DC and grow to oversee an automated system moving freight through that DC. We provide opportunity even as we continue to innovate through technology and prepare our business and workforce for the future. One of the things I have always appreciated about this company is that it's naturally hedged. If customers want more of something and less of something else, we shift our inventory. If the economy is strong, our customers have more money, and that's great. If things are tougher, they come to us for value. With today's inflation, we're continuing to see that happen. We're gaining share across income cohorts, including at the higher end, which made up nearly half of the gains we saw in the U.S. again this quarter. And we're also capturing a greater share of wallet at Sam's Club in the U.S. with both mid- and higher-income shoppers. Our goal is, for the experience they're having in our stores and clubs, combined with our current capabilities for pickup, delivery and membership, to result in them choosing us even as inflation eventually subsides. As we plan this new fiscal year, we've anticipated stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables in particular, which will have some mix impact. We'll stay focused on general merchandise and earn sales in those categories to offset that impact as much as possible. When we think about our business today compared to what it was during prior economic downturns, we now have a more compelling offer, a true omnichannel experience that makes us optimistic that more higher-income families will continue shopping with us across categories because we have pickup, delivery and membership. And we're improving in categories like apparel and home. Our recently remodeled U.S. stores have a focus in those areas, and the early response from customers is promising. We're also improving our e-commerce assortment and presentation in those categories. We've always been known for great prices. And because of the work we've done around pickup and delivery from stores, clubs and expanded assortment through FCs, we're increasingly known for the convenience we offer. In fact, our U.S. customer feedback showed strength in price and convenience. Our reputation for price remains strong, and our score for convenience has risen to nearly the same level. Our Walmart+ members recognize our strength for convenience even more than the average customer. As it relates to our customer or member value proposition, we continue to have a strength with respect to value, while we're expanding choice by growing our assortment on Walmart.com, and we're improving as it relates to experience. Being an at-scale omnichannel retailer creates unique opportunities to innovate in the area of experience. That includes products like Scan And Go at Sam's Club and a newer in-house conversational AI platform enabling a voice and chat capability being used by more than 50 million customers and an average of 1 million associates across the U.S., Mexico, Canada and Chile. We're driving a lot of change inside our company. We know where to tap the brakes on cost and inventory, but our focus is more on the gas pedal with respect to our strategic improvements related to assortment growth and our customer and member experience. We'll keep shaping the business model by scaling our newer mutually reinforcing businesses in areas like marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising. It's exciting to see our global advertising business grow to $2.7 billion for the year we just completed. That's nearly 30% growth. Over the last 3 years, while our frontline focus was on navigating the pandemic and inflation, we still launched and started scaling new complementary businesses using the technology and expertise we developed over time. You can see this in some of our recent announcements. The partnership we announced with Salesforce to help scale local fulfillment and delivery solutions for customers on their e-commerce platform is a good example; or our new Walmart business e-commerce site is another, where we're helping small and medium-sized businesses and nonprofits save money and spend less on purchasing the items they need every day. Our fast-growing businesses in India, Flipkart and PhonePe, announced a full separation, which will allow both companies to focus on their own growth paths independently and help unlock value for shareholders. Flipkart has continued to strengthen its market leadership position in e-commerce and is entering this year with good momentum. PhonePe also announced the closing in January of the initial tranche of a fund raise that values the business at $12 billion pre-money. This is more than double the previous valuation just 2 years ago. And our Sam's Club U.S. team announced expansion plans that will have us opening more than 30 new clubs across the country over the next several years in addition to a multiyear plan to invest in and modernize our supply chain, especially in the U.S. I'll wrap up my comments today by saying thank you to our associates. I'm grateful for how they continue to step up for our customers and members, and I'm impressed by their creativity and resilience. We've worked through a lot of the operational stress in our business from last year, and we made progress on strategic initiatives as we did it, and we're doing it in a way that's uniquely Walmart. John David, over to you. John Rainey : Thanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to wrap up the year. We're pleased with how we finished the year. Our team demonstrated our agility and responsiveness to overcome the operational challenges, from supply chain disruptions, excess inventory and the shift in our merchandise mix. For the full year, enterprise sales on a constant currency basis grew more than 7%, and we surpassed $600 billion in annual sales for the first time. Adjusted EPS declined 2.6% for the year. Our performance in Q4 was better than our expectations due to sales upside and good expense leverage. Constant currency sales grew 8% with strength across all segments, including strong performance throughout the holiday season. Walmart U.S. comps increased 8.3%, including 17% growth in e-commerce, with a combination of pricing due in part to inflation and share gains. Sam's Club U.S. delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 12.6% excluding fuel and tobacco. And constant currency sales in Walmart International increased 5.5%, led by Walmex. As I discuss our profitability, it's important to note the reorganization and restructuring charges within the International segment affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q4 results will focus on the business excluding adjusted items. Gross margins were down 83 basis points, largely resulting from additional markdowns taken to address carryover inventory balances, mix headwinds and underlying inflation in our cost structure. With strong sales growth in the quarter, we levered SG&A expenses by 89 basis points. Taking all this together, adjusted operating income grew nearly 7%. Adjusted EPS of $1.71 was better than we expected going into the quarter. GAAP EPS was $2.32. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.16 benefit from unrealized gains on equity investments partially offset by a $0.55 charge related to business reorganization and restructuring in International. Inventory at quarter end was relatively flat to last year. This includes a nearly 3% decrease from Walmart U.S. I'm pleased with how our teams responded to the challenge early in the year to aggressively rebalance inventory for the current environment, and it sets us up in a really good position going into the year. Let me briefly reference key highlights for Q4 by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales were strong throughout the quarter, and December was the largest sales month in Walmart U.S. history. This was led by strength in food sales, which increased high teens, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in general merchandise sales with softness in toys, electronics, home and apparel. The effects of product mix shifts have negatively impacted our margins. Over the last year, grocery and health and wellness sales, which have a lower margin than general merchandise, have increased by 330 basis points as a portion of our mix. We continue to see strong share gains in grocery with nearly half coming from higher-income households, and private brand penetration increased over 160 basis points as customers prioritized value. Inflation remained high, up mid-teens in food categories, which was similar to Q3 levels. E-commerce sales were led by continued strong growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery in Q4. Over the last 2 years, store-fulfilled delivery sales have nearly tripled, and we're now doing over $1 billion a month, which gives you an indication of why we're so excited about the progress here. Advertising sales were also strong this quarter, up 41%. Higher sales and lower COVID costs contributed to SG&A expense leverage, which offset gross profit pressure, resulting in operating income growth of 3.8%. In International, strong sales trends continued with growth of 5.5% on a constant currency basis led by double-digit growth in Walmex and China. Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $900 million or an approximate 340 basis point headwind to growth. Q4 sales benefited from successful festive events across our markets. Year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by the timing shift of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event to Q3 this year versus Q4 last year. Looking at the second half of the year in total, International sales grew more than 9% in constant currency. E-commerce sales were strong with penetration at 21%, with China leading the way at 48% penetration for the quarter. Walmex had another great quarter with sales strength in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs and 14% growth in e-commerce. Segment adjusted operating income grew faster than sales, up nearly 17% in constant currency, helped by effective cost management across markets. In India, Flipkart continued its strong momentum through Diwali and other seasonal events. We are particularly pleased to see Flipkart's positive contribution margin expanding. PhonePe's recent valuation that Doug talked about was supported by annualized TPV reaching more than $950 billion, about 50% higher than just 1 year ago, while also exceeding more than 4 billion monthly transactions. Turning to Sam's Club. Our strong momentum continued, with comps up 12.6% in Q4 and up 23.4% on a 2-year stack. The segment delivered another quarter of record member counts and membership income growth was above 7%. In addition to solid increases in both transaction and ticket, Sam's e-commerce sales were up 21% year-over-year with contributions from both curbside and ship to home. Operating income was pressured in the quarter by elevated markdowns lapping higher co-branded credit card income last year and an inflation-related LIFO charge of $14 million. With the strong trends at Sam's over the past several years, we're excited to expand our physical footprint through a multiyear investment in new clubs and supply chain optimization. Turning to guidance. As we sit here today, we find ourselves in a similar position to each of the last 3 years, where there is a great deal of uncertainty looking out over the balance of the year. While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high and there is considerable pressure on the consumer. Attempting to predict with precision these swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer behavior is challenging. As such, our guidance reflects a cautious outlook on the macro environment, but at the same time, our excitement about our recent results, momentum in all segments and progress on our strategy both for this year and the years that follow. We are positioned well and convicted about our plan. In FY '24, we expect operating income growth to outpace sales growth. Given the persistence of high prices and the potential for further macro pressures, we are taking a cautious outlook for the year. We are guiding enterprise sales growth of 2.5% to 3% in constant currency and operating income growth of approximately 3%. This guidance assumes product mix pressures persist, but that our business mix continues to improve. Even with an estimated 100 basis point impact from LIFO charges, we still expect to grow operating income more than sales. We also expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 2% to 2.5%, International sales growth in constant currency of approximately 6% and Sam's Club comp sales growth of approximately 5% excluding fuel. Based on FX rates at the end of our fiscal year, we estimate a potential year-over-year enterprise sales tailwind of about $1.2 billion from currency. Our purpose starts by helping people save money and live better, and it's more important than ever in this environment as consumers manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We're reinforcing our value proposition across our merchandise offering, including featuring high-quality owned brands and leaning into opening price points. We're accelerating share gains in our food categories and seeing signs of improved attach rates in consumables and high-frequency purchase areas of general merchandise. Our multiyear sales and operating income targets are just that, multiyear. In some years, our performance will be higher; and in some years, lower. We are confident, however, that we're building a business that allows us to grow our top and bottom line throughout an economic cycle. Over the past 5 years, sales have grown approximately 6% on average, excluding divestitures. This year will likely be lower, but we look forward to getting back to a sales growth trend more in line with what we've delivered over the last few years. Over that same period, operating income has grown at about half the rate of sales growth on an adjusted basis, excluding divestitures. This is the result of important investments we made in associate wages, pricing, technology and supply chain, which together strengthened our core business and position us well for the future. Importantly, while we navigate some of the short-term challenges, we're continuing to invest for the future, invest in ways that strengthen our retail advantages by expanding our capabilities in marketplace, ad platform, data ventures and fulfillment as a service. We're providing more convenience for customers, including pickup and delivery, Scan And Go and Walmart+. We're working in partnership with our suppliers and sellers to use data, scaled fulfillment capabilities and our rapidly growing ad platform to elevate inventory accuracy and in-stocks, lower the cost to serve and drive improved conversion. All of this improves the trajectory of our ROI and our margin profile. We will continue to invest in our associates through increased pay and benefits to reinforce the ladder of opportunities at Walmart. But we're managing our costs in a way that allows us to achieve our operating income goals with these investments. In other words, we're staying true to our commitment of everyday low cost, enabling everyday low prices. We expect FY '24 CapEx to be flat to up slightly in total dollars compared to last year as we continue the multiyear investment in technology and innovation to optimize our supply chain in stores. Many of these tech enhancements are reaching the stage where we can rapidly deploy them across our network, and we have clear line of sight toward better efficiencies and ROI on these investments in the medium term. I want to call out a few other assumptions for our guidance for the year. Gross margin rate is expected to increase this year, though not back to FY '22 levels yet. We expect gross margin to benefit from the lapping of higher supply chain costs and markdowns from this past year as well as growth from our newer initiatives, many of which have a higher profit margin. Partially offsetting this, we expect product mix and inflation-related LIFO charges to be gross margin headwinds. Based on current assumptions for inflation, LIFO charges for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club could approximate roughly $500 million this year with the headwind equally proportioned across quarters. This is an improvement from the $1 billion LIFO estimate we provided on the Q3 call due to moderating inflation in key merchandise categories and reduced inventory levels. It's important to note that inflation, inventory levels and additional factors will influence the aggregate amount. We'll commit to providing updates as we go through the year. With sales growth expected at a lower rate versus the prior year and our commitment to continuing to invest in our people and technology, we expect SG&A to delever slightly in FY '24. There are also several below-the-line items that will pressure EPS for FY '24. First, interest expense is estimated to be about $750 million higher than last year. This translates to an approximate $0.20 year-over-year EPS headwind with Q1's impact less than the remaining quarters. Second, we do not expect a repeat of the benefit we realized from certain discrete tax items last year, and as such, expect our tax rate to be more normalized in FY '24 at 25.5% to 26.5%, resulting in an approximate $0.10 EPS headwind. And lastly, in our noncontrolling interest line, we expect an approximate $0.12 EPS headwind related to acquiring full ownership of Massmart and Alert Innovation as well as the impacts to minority interest of strong expected performance at Walmex. In total, these below-the-line factors account for approximately $0.42 of year-over-year EPS headwind. The impact from these below-the-line items offsets the gains we're making in our core business, resulting in EPS being slightly down for the year. We expect full year EPS of between $5.90 and $6.05, including a $0.14 headwind from LIFO. For the first quarter, we expect to see a higher rate of sales growth of 4.5% to 5%, largely due to inflation. We expect operating income to increase 3.5% to 4%, including the negative impact of a LIFO charge of approximately 235 basis points. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.25 to $1.30, including an approximate $0.03 headwind from LIFO. While we're not providing quarterly guidance beyond Q1, I want to offer the following perspective. We currently expect sales growth to be strongest in the first half then moderating in the second half, reflecting our macro assumptions and a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Because we will lap the benefit we received last year from insurance proceeds in 2Q, we expect operating income to be flat in 2Q relative to last year. We expect operating income growth to begin to outpace sales growth to a greater degree in the second half of the year versus the first half. In closing, I want to echo Doug's Sentiment on our business. Over the last year, our team responded to some of the external challenges with the speed and nimbleness rarely seen in a company of our size, and we exited the year in a much, much better place. As I reflect on where we are today, I'm more excited about our future than at any point in my time here. The opportunity in front of us is incredible. Our customer, member value proposition has never been stronger. Perhaps that's more obvious during times like this, when the consumer is pressured. We have become an omnichannel retailer. Who else has the stores and clubs so close to so many customers and members, combined with first- and third-party e-commerce and the combination of grocery and general merchandise and in multiple attractive countries? We're in the right markets with a breadth of assortment and ways of shopping like no one else with impactful and emerging digital and technological capabilities. Our plan leverages our strengths to serve our customers and members in more ways. We meet them where they are, to continue to help them save money and time, to help them live better. But what you're going to see in the years to come is that we will keep changing, and the changes will improve the composition of our P&L. We will have related, diversified, higher-margin earning streams that are scaling rapidly. You will begin to see the significant benefits from the investments that we're making in things like our supply chain automation and our expanded e-commerce capabilities. We're at an inflection point to begin to accelerate margin expansion, reinforcing that the algorithm is in place. The macro pressures this year may obscure some of that progress, but won't take away from the long-term promise of many of these initiatives. We look forward to sharing more at our Investor Day in April. Thank you. Let me turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Great quarter. Would love your thoughts on consumer health and what you're seeing with respect to unit growth in terms of your guidance and your thoughts about how that may manifest. And then John David, on the technology call-outs, advertising, Walmart+, artificial intelligence. What are your thoughts on things we should focus on in terms of those scaling? And finally, Judith, you had impressive momentum, double-digit growth at Walmex and China. On the China reopening, would love any comments. And on the price investments at Walmex, that would be helpful as well. Doug McMillon : Oliver, you did a great job working in like 6 questions, 5 questions? No. This is Doug. We'll try to make sure we cover all of those. You may have to remind us of 1 or 2. Let's start with consumer health. And I'll just ask Kath, you, John and Judith to quickly comment. And Judith, you can work in the answers to the questions he asked then, if you want to. We were talking just before the call, Oliver, about which adjective to use, and we were coming up with words like choiceful, discerning, thoughtful. I think you can see it in the mix impact. Customers are still spending money. When you think about our guidance and the place we positioned it, it's obviously not as clear to us what the back half of the year looks like as what we're experiencing right now and the momentum that we had coming out of the fourth quarter. But that's the way we would characterize them. They're making choices. We expect that to continue through the year. Kath, you want to add something for Sam's? Kathryn McLay : Yes. I'll just say, as we went kind of through Q4, we were watching with interest to see how they behaved in home and apparel, GM, discretionary. We're happy to see high single-digit comp growth there. And we're watching, as we went through Super Bowl and Valentine, and we're still seeing kind of that hold. So yes, positive with where we're at, at the moment. John Furner : Oliver, thanks for the question. First, I just want to say thanks to all of our associates for delivering a great quarter and everything they did last year. There are so many things that they went through collectively, and they just did a great job building momentum as the year went on. On the consumer. I think choiceful is a great word to describe it. There certainly was momentum coming out of the fourth quarter. But Walmart's built a lot of options for customers, and we'll be more flexible than we have been in the past, whether it's in the store or pickup or delivery. John David mentioned the momentum that we have with delivery from stores. So we'll be there for customers as things continue to shift. Judith McKenna : Yes. Maybe, Oliver, for International, it actually was a strong quarter, which ended a strong year for us with that top line and bottom line growth of around about 9%. That strength came out of a number of our markets. And you touched on Mexico and China, but India as well had a good year. Maybe just talking about the consumer. What never ceases us to amaze me, as you think about being a global business, is how similar the consumer is around the world, which we can take a lot of learning from. And certainly, events, moments that matter, were important to consumers. We also saw a continuing rise in their digital capabilities and what they're looking from for the businesses. And then the third area that I will talk about is the rise of private brands in terms of the way consumers were shopping as well. And that's pretty much held true in every market in which we operate. Maybe turning to Mexico. So I'll pick up the third part of your question within this first piece. Another strong quarter for Mexico. This actually tops off the ninth year in a row that Mexico has gained market share. And I think none of those things is testament to the strength of the formats in Mexico and the way that they appeal across all sectors of the Mexican and Central American population as well. The consumer health there, again, choiceful, thoughtful are really good words to describe it. But that breadth format allows us play right across that spectrum. And in the quarter, Mexico continues to invest in price. They saw the largest ever price gap in Bodegas, which is the key format. But that strength really comes from a 3-point advantage that they have. The first is they continue to open new stores, which customers still want to be able to shop in physical stores. We opened 126 stores last year. We continue to expand our e-commerce footprint in omnichannel, on-demand. So grocery online and pickup is going from strength to strength. And then, interestingly, and I think this speaks to consumer as well at building out that ecosystem. Where you can get trust, value and convenience in offers such as our BAIT, which is our MVNO in Mexico; or our Cashi payment capabilities, we're seeing strength there. So China, turning to China. Clearly, the big news in China was the opening of China. As I look though into last year, we saw continued strength in hypermarkets, which is the higher-end offering that we have within China, slightly different positioning to Sam's Clubs in the U.S. and in Mexico. They continued very strongly. But also, people shopped back into hypermarkets again, and we saw some of our best performance in hypermarket than we have for some time. But the real consumer trend, and it's probably one that is worth taking note of globally is what's happening in e-commerce in China. So you'll have seen in the results that we talked about, 70% growth in Q4, which was 163% 2-year stack for China on e-commerce growth and a penetration now reaching 48%. That is undoubtedly helped by the buildup into Chinese New Year. That buildup fell into Q4. But we continue to see that as part of economic behavior. With the opening, we have seen people returning more to stores, which is what you would expect and also wanting to celebrate events and I think that Chinese New Year position speaks to that. So overall, strong for international consumer behavior, similar around the world. It holds up as well in India, which also had some strength in that, and nowhere more so for the digital economy than our Flipkart and PhonePe businesses. John Rainey : Oliver, this is John, David. I'll take the question on the initiatives. And one of the exciting things about this is actually how they all work together and importantly, not just working together, but how the investments that we're making in our supply chain helped to make this a profitable operation for us. It's tough to single out one particular area. But if I had to, I'd say Marketplace is perhaps the linchpin of all this because that gives us the ability to sell third-party merchandise as well as first party. And just this last quarter, we now have over 400 million SKUs on our Marketplace. And a significant portion of those are -- actually avail themselves of our fulfillment services as well, which is a great benefit for us. But as we get more assortment on the Marketplace, we get more eyeballs coming to our website. That allows more advertisers or makes advertisers want to spend money there to -- with the larger audience. And this all sort of works together. And if you look at our e-commerce business today, it's an $80 billion business and still growing, and we have a lot of opportunity there going forward. And so we're we've always been known for price. But as Doug noted in his remarks, we're also now being known for convenience. And a lot of the things that we're doing are helping our customers live better with the convenience that we're offering. Operator : The next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : One theme of a question is the flywheel and the balance between investments and bottom line growth. The near-term question of the theme is the '24 outlook looks like it's burdened by some maybe fleeting items, LIFO in particular, some of the bottom line. So what's the right way to think about it? Are these good guys into '25 and/or the house money that you invest? And then the conceptual question on the flywheel is what do you do with the high-margin earnings streams John David mentioned? Have you set out whether or not that goes back in the business and you grow your EBIT dollars faster? Or you do let your margins expand at a faster rate? Doug McMillon : Simeon, this is Doug. I'll kick it off and then John David can add. I think generally it's the latter. We feel like that our price gaps are in a good spot that we've made, the thoughtful wage investments that we need to make. That doesn't mean that wages may not continue to go up over time. But generally, the shape of the income statement is in pretty good shape. And then we've got these other items that are scaling that have changed the business model. And so you end up mixing yourself. I think John David did a great job in his remarks describing we're going to face some merchandise mix pressure this year across markets, but the business model itself, the business mix, is changing. That's been our strategy, and now we're starting to see some of those numbers grow as in -- with advertising income. I think in the investment category, the thing that we're most excited about is the automation opportunity we have, and that's reflected in our capital guidance. We've shared with some of you how excited we are about some of the things that are in front of us in distribution centers that will impact stores in a positive way. But that's more of a CapEx and balance sheet investment view than shaping the income statement differently, as we've done in recent years. John Rainey : Sure. And I'll add, Simeon, that we do expect to see our return on investment improve marginally this year. That's what's in our plan. But that's really before we expect a sharper acceleration in the years to follow. And we'll give you more insight into that at our Investor Day, but we're very mindful that we need to show a return for these investments, but the good news is the early reads on some of the things that we're doing are really exciting and support that continued level of investment. I'll give you an example. Like our perishable DCs, where we put some automation in place. We had a plan around what that would result in increased throughput in terms of cases per hour. The actual results are almost 50% better than that. And so that like gives us conviction to want to accelerate some of this. Same story with some of our e-commerce DCs, where we see a 12-step process going down to 5 steps, making us a lot more efficient. And so these are high-ROI investments where we've got clear line of sight into the return. So to your point, this allows us to not only invest appropriately with our associates and continued technology but also to see margin expansion over time. Doug McMillon : I'd just quickly add. Our sales have been stronger these last few years. I mean, the 6% CAGR over the last 5 is a much higher number than you look -- than you would have experienced with the company previously. But then we had these unusual things happen with COVID costs and last year inflation and supply chain costs. And we're hoping for something that looks a little more normal going forward that would enable us to push through the strategy in a way that you see it in operating income growth. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Horvers for JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : So can you talk about how you're thinking about the Walmart U.S. comp guide of 2% to 2.5%? Inflation has barely ticked down in recent periods, it's still up double digits. Are you expecting grocery unit trends to deteriorate? Is gen merch still down this year? And ultimately, do you expect the U.S. business to go negative in the back half on a potential recession? And speaking in a second. On the Sam's side, the business has a lot of momentum with comp and strong KPIs. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the opportunity to grow clubs? Over the next 3 to 5 years, do you see it as an opportunity to fill in existing markets or expand in sort of less dense markets than new geographies on the coast? John Rainey : Chris, this is John David. I'll start and then turn it over to Kath and John for a little more color on their segments. But with respect to our guidance. Look, guidance is -- it's tricky in so far as you want to provide transparency, but you -- and also you need to balance that with reliability. And as we sit here today, we look at the progress that we're making in our business and we've got a lot of conviction and excitement around that, but there's a lot of uncertainty with the macro backdrop. We've not been in a position where we've seen the Fed tighten this sharply. We see issues where delinquencies are up, and things like auto loans, you've got savings rates that are coming down. And there's a lot of unknowns in the back half of the year. And so what we've attempted to balance with our guidance is a cautious outlook on the macro environment, but coupled with a lot of excitement about the progress that we're making. And so I think the read-through on our guidance is just that there remains to be a lot of unknowns as we're sitting here just a few weeks into the year. John Furner : Yes. And Chris, this is John. I'll just build on that. Certainly pleased to see some of the momentum in food and other categories, including unit growth in the last quarter. There was both traffic and basket expansion, which are both positive indicators. I think John David described well the way we're thinking about the year cautiously given all the unknowns in the operating environment. But I would just highlight the team here in Walmart U.S. have done a great job expanding our ability to deliver from stores, deliver from fulfillment centers. You heard a bit about automation. So there's a lot of investment that we feel great about the return possibilities given the experience we've had with some of these technologies. And as you bundle all this together, we're positioning ourselves well, I think, to be able to grow and continue to grow like we have last few years. Since we merged our e-commerce and store business together just about 3 years ago in Walmart U.S., we see growth of almost $79 billion, almost $80 billion for the 3 years. So quite a bit of growth there. And the team is really focused on top line, as you'd expect of a big merchandising organization like this one. Kathryn McLay : And if I just pick up on the Sam's growth. I think we've talked quite a bit about the 12 quarters of double-digit comp growth. But if you look underneath that strength and growth across traffic every single one of those quarters, across ticket, our membership income has grown solidly across those 12 quarters. We've grown in e-com. We're growing with Scan And& Go. If I look at the actual membership composition, we're growing with mid- to high household income groups with share of wallet. We're growing with millennials and Gen Z as the largest growth area in our membership base. And then if I look at market share, we're growing market share in our club channel despite no opening clubs while our competitors were opening clubs. So if you look at that suite of kind of metrics, you look at it and you realize that the value proposition we have at Sam's is winning and it's resonating with our member base and it's resonating with new members. And so we are looking at growing both in fill-in opportunities as well as into new geographies where we don't have as a large a presence. So we're excited about opening clubs, it will take us a minute to build up that pipeline, but we've already got some exciting areas we're looking at. Operator : Next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : On this call, there's been a few different references to an algorithm to 6% top line growth compounded over the last few years to growing operating income faster than sales. Previously, we were under the expectation that Walmart was managing its business over the long term to a 4% top line growth and greater than 4% operating income growth. It's going to fall short of that this year. Is it still a realistic expectation that Walmart is managing the enterprise to that 4% top line, 4.5% -- better than 4.5% operating income growth number? And is it reasonable for that to kick in as early as next year? John Rainey : Michael, this is John David. Yes is the short answer. It's absolutely realistic to assume that. But when we put out multiyear targets, they're not designed or not intended to suggest that we can hit that in any economic environment, in any year. And so we're certainly -- our guidance this year reflects some of the pressures that we see broadly in economies around the world. But we'll be able to give more insight into both our top line and bottom line in terms of what we anticipate over the next several years at our Investor Day in April. But we absolutely 100% believe that we've got a business that can drive that kind of outcome, where we've got sales growing at 4% or higher, frankly, as well as operating income outpacing that. Again, it goes back to my earlier comments around some of the investments that we've made, not only in our supply chain, but in investing in our associates and some of our technology that really put us with a -- give us a footing to realize some of these results of margin expansion and outsized growth in our bottom line over the next several years. Doug McMillon : Oliver, this is Doug. I'll just second what John David said and then call out this last 5 years' performance again and say, 6% and 3%, 6% top line, 3% bottom line, is obviously not 4% and 4%. But we don't feel too bad about the 6%, and we just wish that, that 3 was a 6.1%, and we'd be in really good shape. So we don't know exactly what the external environment is going to enable us to do. But because this business is based on value and has a breadth of categories, we are positioned to do well relative to the market regardless of what happens in the environment. And as we're doing it, as you've heard us say for a long time now, we're changing the business model so that operating income can grow while still having low prices. Do both at the same time. That's what we've set ourselves up to do, and we're making progress at that, and you can see it in the results in the pieces that we've shared with you already. John Rainey : If I can just say one more thing, Michael, what we're fundamentally focused on is growing the absolute dollars of free cash flow each year. It's -- when we look at the composition of our business and how it's changing and the returns related to some of these initiative areas, it's just such that the financial architecture suggests that the operating income should outperform sales growth over the next several years. But fundamentally, we understand what creates value for shareholders, and we're focused on growing the absolute dollars of free cash flow. Michael Lasser : And just to clarify that, John David. To the extent that you do better, especially in the U.S. business this year, should your incremental margin on that upside be consistent or better than it's been historically, given you'll be lapping COVID costs, a lot of inventory disposition and other factors that shouldn't repeat this year? John Rainey : Yes, it's a good call out. I appreciate the opportunity to address that. You're right. If you look, particularly for the U.S. business, the incremental margins will be higher year than what you typically see, and in large part for the reason that you mentioned. We're lapping -- like even in the last quarter, we lapped $500 million of COVID costs alone in that quarter. But when you look at it on a full year basis, that creates a tailwind in terms of incremental margins. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : We were just wondering, with regards to the promotional environment within grocery, are you still finding the promotional environment rational? Are there any areas that maybe aren't as solid as others? And I think you've alluded to this on the call today, but your view on the need for price investments in food going forward and the possibility of that being incorporated in your guidance for this year. John Furner : Kate, it's John. Thanks for the question. First, I'd just anchor what we're doing in the purpose of the company is to help people save money and live better. So we're constantly thinking about making sure that our values are appropriate given what's going on in the relative marketplace. And as Doug alluded to earlier, we're encouraged by the price positioning relative to the market, and we'll continue to work on that. Externally, I wouldn't call it any major shifts in what we're seeing. In terms of promotion, there has definitely been a shift, and we see this internally as well, and an acceleration in the fourth quarter to more private brand versus branded product. That shift really began last March and continued all year, and the fourth quarter got a bit stronger. We don't set targets for branded versus private brand, and we want to be there for any customer and make sure that quality and value are right across all product lines. But there is definitely some acceleration to private brands in the last 90 days. Operator : Next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Curious if you could talk about what the net impact of Flipkart and PhonePe was on consolidated results this past year, and what your expectations are built in to guidance for the upcoming year. I'm also just curious what the plans are for that business and your ownership of those businesses? And then just a quick one. Sorry if I missed it, but your share repo or share count assumptions that are built into your guidance for this upcoming year. Doug McMillon : We had a difficult time hearing you. The question was about Flipkart and PhonePe and is it reflected in our guidance for the year forward. That's all we got. Can you clarify a little bit more for us? Paul Lejuez : Sure. It was really about how much Flipkart and PhonePe contributed to results this [indiscernible] upcoming year. Also the ownership of them, I guess, what are the plans there? And then the last question was just on share repo assumption or your share count assumption that's built into guidance for F'23. John Rainey : Paul, this is John David. There is a little bit of a bad connection, so I'm going to attempt to answer this. And if we don't completely address your question, then we can follow up after the call.  But the onetime costs related to the separation were called out separately from our results related to restructuring. But in terms of the core business and the way that, that affects our results, a lot of our GMV growth, a lot of our revenue growth is coming from, in particular, Flipkart. We see great progress over there, where they continue to be a strong player in the market that they operate in. And as I noted in my comments on the call, we're in much better position right now with respect to some of the investments that we've made historically. Any e-commerce or any digital platform, you need an infrastructure that you can scale at a low marginal cost, and that's what Flipkart has done. They've invested in that infrastructure over the last 3 years. So now we're able to see that contribution profit continue to expand. And so we're excited about that. I think there was a part of your question that was related to the separation of PhonePe and Flipkart and what that allows them to do. And Judith, feel free to jump in here. But to me, this is in some ways very analogous to eBay and PayPal, where each of them operating independently can pursue their own initiatives. And are -- they don't necessarily need to be tied together. And so this is an opportunity for them to unlock and realize more value independently than they can by themselves. Judith, anything you'd add before I go on? Judith McKenna : Maybe just comment on the separation of the 2 businesses. So you have to remember, we've -- when we first invested into Flipkart, PhonePe had only just launched. It was 4 months old, and it had an annualized TPV as kind of like in the tens of millions of dollars. As that business has grown and as the Flipkart business has grown, whilst there are partnerships between the 2 commercially, actually, we recognize that each has been successful, and we're setting them up on a path for long-term success. As I look at Flipkart now, and John David referenced it and so did Doug, I'm really impressed with the contribution margins which are positive and been consistently positive for some time. And that structurally well, not only from a cost perspective, in terms of the infrastructure investment that we've made for their e-commerce business, for their delivery and distribution business, but also the way they're working on their margin mix. In PhonePe, I think the highlights there are, clearly, I talked about the size of their annualized TPV when we acquired them. That has reached $950 billion in last year. At the end of last year, that was their run rate. And then now doing 4 billion transactions a month. So that separation allowed us to put both of them on the path to being the very best businesses they can be in the long term. And the fundamentals of India remains strong and in fact are strengthening all the time. So it was a challenge from some of the adjustments that we needed to make in order to do that, but really testament to the strength of both businesses and the economy in which we operate. John Rainey : And I believe the last part of your question related to share count assumptions for this year. Let me take the opportunity to just talk about capital allocation broadly in answering that question. We've been historically very balanced with respect to our capital allocation, both investing organically done in mergers and acquisitions as well as dividend and share buyback, and we will remain balanced going forward. But as we sit here today, I think the scales tilt a little bit more towards organic investment when we look at the returns related to that. Every dollar of capital has to compete for the highest returns. And as noted in my comments earlier, when we see the returns around some of these technology and supply chain investments, these are ones that we think translate into increased shareholder value. And so relative to last year, you'll probably see us do less on share buyback. And therefore, it will have less accretion in terms of the earnings impact. But last year, we saw a dislocation in our stock and we were opportunistic and more aggressive at that period of time, and we'll always be responsive to factors like that in the market. But our planning assumption is to buy back less stock than we did last year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Karen Short : Just 2. First of all, I wanted to talk about the Walmart U.S. EBIT margin structure specifically within your guidance. Obviously, '22 or your fiscal '23 had its own separate challenges, and we know there is a LIFO headwind in fiscal '24. But I guess I want to talk a little bit about what the U.S. EBIT margin structure could be like going forward in fiscal '24 relative to pre-pandemic. And then the second question I would just ask is that you are obviously cautious for the reasons that you called out. But prior evidence is that you actually tend to do very well in weak macro environment/recessions. So I'm just curious on why there's such a much more cautious tone. John Rainey : I'll start, Karen. And it's good to speak with you. John may want to jump in. But I'll start with the first part of your question. So the EBIT structure related to the U.S. business, there's a couple of factors there. One is, if you look over the last 12 months, we had a mix shift in our business from GM to food and consumables of over 300 basis points. And we actually don't expect that to improve this year. In fact, we expect it to get a little bit worse, not by the same magnitude, but slightly worse. So that affects the margin structure. But as noted, our business composition, or the things like our initiatives, advertising, Walmart fulfillment services, those are contributing to a larger share of our overall business, which has less of an impact as we look at this fiscal year. It will be more pronounced as we get into the next year and the year thereafter that, where you see the margin structure change a little bit more. And certainly, LIFO is something that we expect to have some impact this year, but not a prolonged effect in the years that follow. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the EBIT profile. With respect to our cautious tone and the fact that we tend to do well when the consumer is pressured. Look, we recognize that. We also think that we've got a great value proposition for consumers, and in good economic times too, and we're eager to demonstrate that. But again, I would just point you to the fact that there's just a lot that we don't know. We could tilt into a recession. We don't know what happens to consumer spending. We don't know what happens to layoffs, household income. And so given that we're so early into the year and there's a lot of unknowns right now, we're simply taking a cautious outlook. Operator : The next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : My question was just if we could get maybe a little more color maybe from Doug on Walmart+ and sort of how it's doing versus your -- more on how it's doing versus expectations. And what the customer is responding to for the new signups in Walmart+. And how do you see profitability for first-party e-commerce business evolving? Is that key to getting back to that long-term algorithm of growing operating income faster than sales? Doug McMillon : Robbie, I'll go first. This is Doug. John is going to jump in here, too. I just say that the way that the business model is evolving, that includes 1P plus 3P, plus the services that go along with that, including advertising income, to us, make a ton of sense. They're mutually reinforcing. We're excited about the progress that we're making there. And Walmart+ is one ingredient of that. And we'll continue to describe Walmart+ to you, but not do that in such a way that the market gets overly focused on that metric. Because we want to be evaluated on several metrics, not just one metric. And we've seen other companies with some sort of shorthand where people are watching one metric to determine the future of the company. That is just not that simple in Walmart. Obviously, people want to pay for delivery in bulk with an annual membership, not per delivery. That's what led us to this point. And now it opens all kinds of opportunities to us. And we like what's happening behaviorally with Walmart+, but it's just one component of a plan. John Furner : Yes, I think that's a great way, Doug, to describe it as an important part of what we're building. And it's a way that customers can access an interesting combination of all of our assets from our digital front end, which has become one experience over the last couple of years. The fact that we have inventory within 10 miles in 90% of the population is another way that this all comes together. And the business model itself, and we've said this before, and I'll just repeat it, it's becoming more difficult to measure the differences in e-commerce and stores because stores are acting as fulfillment centers at times. They're stores primarily, and then there are fulfillment centers, so there are a lot of blurred lines between all these channels. So having an offer that is great for consumers in terms of the behavior they're seeking, which is convenience, and not worrying about incremental delivery fees is working fantastically. Now it's also important to note that this tends to be a younger, more tech-savvy consumer, which is great. In some cases, a higher-income customer. So as we've said in the most recent quarters, we've gained share with higher-income customers. Walmart+ with delivery, and then these other businesses, like advertising, fulfillment services, Marketplace, all add up to a better proposition for both the customer and the company. Operator : Next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I was hoping to ask more on food inflation. As your team looks forward, what's your expectation for food inflation? And then I'm also curious on what you're seeing right now on the inflation front for non-foods. John Furner : And generally speaking, food inflation has been the most stubborn of all the categories. We were in mid-double digits in Q3 and Q4. Hasn't come down all that much. A little bit, I guess we could say, has come down the last couple of months, but it still would be a high level of disinflation at this point. So this looks to be a little bit higher than what we were expecting going into the year, but this all leads back to the comments earlier on uncertainty. We would have hoped and expected it have -- to have come back more than it has going into this year. There are other parts of the business where prices have come down more, like in general merchandise. But overall, I think we're taking a very cautious outlook and going to continue working on doing everything we can to try to keep prices as low as possible for our customers. Doug McMillon : The way to think about it is dry grocery and consumables are stubborn mid-double digit, and those are going to just be with us for a while. And it will get a little confusing because you'll probably hear inflation numbers that start to sound lower, but you'll have to remember that's on a 2-year stack. So if inflation in dry grocery and consumables is only 3% or 5%, that's on top of 15%. And that's still a problem for the customer and still a pressure to their wallet. In the fresh categories, things are a little bit different. Like eggs were at 200% inflated in January. They're down now to being just 50% inflated. That's still a problem. Milk is actually less than 1 year ago. Beef is lower in terms of pricing. So think of the fresh categories as kind of bouncing around, going up and down and being more volatile. It's dry grocery and consumables that we think are going to create the pressure that customers are going to feel and have the impact it relates to us on mix over the course of the year. And that's one of the variables that's a little hard to call, what will GM look like in the back half of the year? Operator : Next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to understand a little bit more some of the factors that were pressure or that were cycling from fiscal '23, including the pressures from markdowns, mix and supply chain. Wondering if you can just help us understand the magnitude of those pressures this year and what is baked into your guidance for fiscal '24. Particularly, I think I heard that you say maybe, correct me if I'm wrong, 300 basis point gap again between grocery and general merchandise again this year. So just trying to understand that, the magnitude of that mix. I'd assume markdowns are planned to be much lower, but maybe you can help us there. And then are you baking in some cushion for a more promotional environment? Or just help us understand really what is baked into some of those major margin buckets as we look to next year. Doug McMillon : Before these guys comment, I just want to quickly call out that we're profitable in food, and I don't want this to grow to the point where people think, \"Well, they make money in general merchandise. They don't in food.\" There's a delta between all things, food, consumables, but there are some really profitable businesses in fresh and other areas. So we want to manage that mix, but I just don't want this to get too far out of balance. John Furner : And on the -- great point, Doug. And on the 300 basis point, that comment was related to last year, the shift -- the difference in mix between food and GM in the year that we just experienced. So we do think we'll have some mix impact going into this year, which we stated. But we don't -- we didn't say it was 300 for the year we're going into. Certainly, food inflation and GM sales can change that number. And that's why we're, as we said, taken a cautious outlook because food inflation, amongst other things, has remained more unstable than what we have expected. So it's higher than what we thought it would be. But that point on food being a profitable business at Walmart is important. So we -- if the customer wants to spend more on the food categories, and general merchandise will be there for them, of course, we'd like to sell both because we have a really strong seasonal business. And like we stated earlier, we had a strong Valentine's, a strong New Year. Pleased with the holidays that we just went through in the fourth quarter. But we want to remain open and flexible for the customer given any environment that we find ourselves in. John Rainey : Yes. Kelly, this is John David. I'll add just a little bit more color. And maybe looking at the fourth quarter is a good way to frame this. Our gross profit declined a little over 100 basis points. I think it's 112 basis points in the fourth quarter. That was predominantly if you had to bucket that. The largest contributor to that was markdowns followed by mix. And so as we look at where we are today, with a much better position around inventory, and John, jump in if you disagree here, but I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns. Or more -- certainly more normal than what it was last year. And to John's point, the mix impact is appreciably less than what the 300 basis points, a little more than 300 basis points last year. John Furner : Yes. This is the time last year. Just to remind you, back in February, March last year, we were really getting caught up from ocean backlogs and receiving product that should have been onshore as much as 6 months prior to it being unloaded. And the cost, the markdowns, the impact and everything, from store labor to creating overtime, we expect some of those to be better. However, down 3% of inventory, we're proud of that position. But there are still pockets of inventory in stores and some fulfillment centers and some categories like apparel where there's still more work to be done. So we want to make sure that we have room to address those things as we get into first half of the year. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : Really, I had a follow-up on the U.S. traffic trends and then on Sam's Club. For the U.S., it sounds like in that guide, the deceleration of the second half comp is all from less inflation, and that you still expect traffic to be up through the year. Just wanted to be sure that, that's fair. And second, on Sam's Club, any more insight in terms of the members you've won? And I know you had a fee hike last year. Has that had any influence in terms of the rate of growth of at least member counts? Or any sort of inflection there or anything on renewal rates given the first in a decade fee hike? John Furner : Greg, it's John. Yes, certainly, I would expect that there will be growth in traffic. That's what we've been seeing over the last several quarters, led by food and consumables. The growth of pickup and delivery and then e-commerce to home are also helping. So stronger results in e-commerce at its core and also stronger from the delivery business. John David mentioned in his remarks that we had $1 billion month in December, which is really exciting to see what the team has scaled from and to over the last 5 or 6 years. Certainly some acceleration since the 2 channels, e-commerce and stores, were merged together last -- about 3 years ago. But it continues to be a lot of great work done, increased capacity and fulfillment all across the network. Kathryn McLay : Yes. I'll just pick up from the Sam's perspective. I think last year, we had a couple of big acquisitions around Super Bowl and then around July 4. And I think the marketing of those as well as offering, with curbside and Scan And Go and convenience, meant that we're attracting a lot younger member base than what we've previously had. So I think we're really happy with the way the membership kind of composition is trending. And then if I just look at like the renewal rate, we're not seeing an impact from the fee increase. Remember that this year, we did do an offset with Sam's Cash, and that's pretty much what we're seeing, is it's kind of neutralized any impact we could have expected to see to our renewal rate. But it's also meant that those members, because they get Sam's Cash available to them on the app, are becoming more digitally engaged with us. So this whole kind of approach around driving convenience and digital engagement is working, and we're seeing growth through the absolute membership numbers as well as staying strong in renewals. Gregory Melich : If I could, I'd love to follow up on the e-commerce part of the U.S. You talked about margin drivers with advertising, gave us some numbers there. Do we -- can you tell us what 3P is now as a percentage of that e-commerce business, or shipments, or any insight there? John Furner : That is something we haven't disclosed. What we did say earlier, which is important, is the absolute number of items is now over 400 million. We have a really strong leader in the business who's building capabilities. And we know that their seller demand, sellers all across the market are looking for more ways to diversify their own business. So this is a great time for us to make the improvements we're making with things like sign up and the ability to list catalogs more easily, and that's led to the item and SKU count growth. Operator : At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : Thank you all for your interest in the company. I think the 3 headlines are strong results, great team, bright future. On the results side, we have momentum. The fourth quarter was really good. We got the inventory into a good place. We're on our front foot as we start the year. As it relates to having a great team, just look at what they did last year. When the world changed, they moved quickly at scale to deal with issues. They got them resolved. Q3 was better. Q4 even stronger. And as it relates to our future, we're now positioned to serve the customer how they like to be served, stronger on convenience as well as being known for value. If they want to pick up, we can do that. If they want delivery, we can do that in various forms. And obviously, we've got great stores and clubs. And then secondarily, the business model is changing. Some of the things we've been working on for these last few years are starting to scale, and we're excited about that. So as we begin the year, we're going to stay focused on those things and drive them and have the best possible year. And we'll talk about our guidance at the end of the year to see how we did. We'll go drive the results, and that will be our focus. Thank you, all. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin. Steph Wissink : Thank you and welcome everyone. We are excited to discuss the results of a strong first quarter and our upwardly revised outlook for the year. Joining me on the call are Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. Following prepared remarks from Doug and John David, we will take your questions. At that time, we will be joined by our segment CEOs John Furner from Walmart U.S., Judith McKenna from Walmart International, and Kath McLay from Sam's Club. In order to address as many of your questions as we can in the time allotted for this call, please limit yourself to one question. The operator will mute your line after your question has been post. After management has responded we will move to the next person in line.  Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire Safe Harbor Statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, we are now ready to begin. Doug McMillon : Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss our Q1 results. We had a strong first quarter. Sales growth was strong globally, including growth of 26% in e-commerce. Profit grew much faster than sales and we made further progress on inventory levels. The omnichannel model we're building continues to resonate with customers and members. As expected, a higher mix of sales in the food and consumables categories negatively affected gross profit, but strong expense management and progress with our newer mutually reinforcing businesses helped us grow profit ahead of sales at 17.3%. The business model we outlined at our recent investor conference is taking shape.  International had a great quarter, continuing our momentum from last year. Sales grew 12.9% in constant currency and profit grew even faster at 41%. China, Walmex and Flipkart all saw double-digit top line growth. In China, the reopening of the economy coincided with the Chinese New Year season and that drove traffic to our clubs and stores. Sam's Club China continues its strong performance. For India, a group of us were there last week and we left even more excited about our opportunities. Flipkart and PhonePe are doing well. Our Walmart tech team there is strong and we have a big opportunity to increase our exports from India across quite a few merchandise categories.  In the U.S. both Walmart and Sam's Club performed well with good transaction growth, positive units in food, and strong e-commerce growth. We continue to gain market share in the grocery category, including with higher income and younger shoppers and we saw good growth in membership income in both businesses. At Sam's Club, U.S. member count and plus member penetration hit all-time highs in the quarter. Our growth is now being driven by convenience in addition to price. We see it across formats and income and age cohorts. In terms of inventory, we're in good shape and stock is improving and excess inventory keeps coming down. We see it in the numbers and I'm seeing it on store and club visits.  Globally customers continue to seek value given the impact of inflation. We see it in the U.S. and in other markets like Mexico, Canada, and Chile. Private brand penetration is up about 110 basis points versus last year for Walmart U.S. and 50 basis points for Walmex. We continue to manage our price gaps and deliver value for our customers. In Walmart U.S. general merchandise costs are now lower than a year ago, which is great, but they're still higher than two years ago on like items. In the dry grocery and consumables categories like paper goods, we continue to see high single-digit to low double-digit cost inflation. We all need those prices to come down. The persistently high rates of inflation in these categories lasting for such a long period of time are weighing on some of the families we serve. This stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year because of the cumulative impact on discretionary spending and other categories, specifically, general merchandise.  We think we've got guidance where it should be reflecting the appropriate amount of conservatism given the external environment. We feel very good about our performance, our multiyear momentum, and our ability to serve people however they want to shop and do it at a value. We're executing well and performing well in all three segments. John David will say more about how we're thinking about guidance in a minute. As we look ahead to Q2 and the rest of the year, we're focused on getting our merchandise costs and retails down to fight inflation for our customers and members, which will help us with mix, pick-up and delivery execution, whether that comes from a store or an FC, expense management, and inventory management by item and category. There are places to play offense and there are places to be more conservative. We shouldn't be treating every category the same way and we aren't. We're playing offense where we should and controlling what we can control. Last month, we hosted our investor meeting in Florida where we visited a DC store and a Sam's Club. For those of you that made that trip, thank you. We really enjoyed it and hope you did too. We had three takeaways. First, we're positioned to grow because we can serve customers and members however they want to be served. Second, over time, we expect to grow profit faster than sales and improve operating margin due to productivity improvements and the mix of businesses. And third, we will be disciplined with capital to improve ROI as we grow operating income.  I hope you can see how the investments we've made in recent years are driving results. We added nearly $11 billion in sales in Q1, delivered 58 basis points of expense leverage, and expanded operating margin by 34 basis points. As for returns, we want operating profit growing faster than sales and we expect to see an inflection in ROI in the coming quarters as we begin to lap large one-time items from past quarters.  The investor meeting also gave us an opportunity to show off a piece of the automation we're working on in an ambient DC and while it's an important piece of what we're building, our overall set of capabilities go far beyond that. We're building a more connected, intelligent, and automated network. We're adding market fulfillment centers or MFC's, which utilize automated storage and retrieval systems and we expect to add thousands of electric vehicles to support our last mile delivery capabilities. It's about creating a supply chain that's better, not just bigger. We're excited about how our new capabilities will help our associates by making some of our more physically demanding jobs into more rewarding, higher skilled career paths. We're hosting our annual shareholder\u2019s week events in a couple of weeks here in Northwest Arkansas. Part of the experience will include a tour of an MFC we've just opened. It'll be a good chance to see another piece of what we're building.  I'll close by saying thank you. Thank you to our associates for helping us deliver another strong quarter. We're proud of them and pleased that both Walmart and Sam's Club in the U.S. were recently certified as a great place to work by the industry leader in workplace excellence. Thank you for your interest in our company. Now over to John David. John David Rainey : Thanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to start the year. Despite a challenging macro environment, the team executed and we've made progress advancing our various strategic initiatives. I'll begin by reviewing highlights for the quarter using the framework of growth, margins, and returns. Then I'll spend a couple of minutes reviewing key themes for our recent Investor Day before detailing our updated guidance. Starting with growth, for the first quarter constant currency sales increased nearly 8% or about $11 billion with strength across all segments. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 7.4%, including 27% growth in e-commerce. After a strong start, sales growth moderated as the quarter progressed. The 90 basis point deceleration and comp sales growth from Q4 was driven by pricing and the effect of lapping higher inflation rates in the prior year period. We continue to gain share and grow unit volume and grocery. This was consistent with our expectations on how we built our plan. At the headline level, consumer spending has proven resilient, but below the surface, we continue to see signs that customers remain choiceful, particularly in discretionary categories.  In Q1 we saw a nearly 360 basis point shift in U.S. sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness. To benchmark the magnitude of this shift exceeds the 330 basis points of category mix shift we experienced in all of last year. In addition to the persistence of inflation and food and consumables, customers were also impacted by a reduction of SNAP benefits and lower tax refunds. These impacts were partially offset by higher spending tied to an increase and the cost of living adjustment for Social Security Benefits. In our international segment, sales were strong, up nearly 13% on a constant currency basis led by double-digit growth in China, Walmex and Flipkart. Many of the same impacts on consumer spending in the U.S. affected our international markets too. And Sam's Club U.S. comp sales increased 7% with member fee income up 6.3%. Average spend per member increased mid-single-digits.  Now on margins, consolidated gross margins decreased 18 basis points with ongoing pressure from category sales mix globally. This headwind was partially offset by a reduction in supply chain and freight costs relative to last year's heightened levels. Category mix was a notable headwind across geographies and formats. Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales declined mid-single-digits while food and consumable sales increased low double-digits. Headline inflation and food and consumables came down over 400 basis points from the start of Q1 to the end of the quarter. But prices remain high and customers are being cautious with their spend in discretionary categories. And while we make attractive margins in food and consumables, they have a lower margin than general merchandise.  We expect category mix to remain a gross margin headwind for the balance of FY 2024. The higher margin initiatives that are connected to our core Omni retail business, including marketplace, advertising, and membership continue to meaningfully outgrow the base. I'll discuss each of these. First, marketplace and fulfillment services. We're growing our marketplace with new items and sellers and an improved experience. We've increased seller counts in the U.S. by more than 40% year-over-year and the number using Walmart fulfillment services has more than doubled. We're adding higher profile in demand brands that our customers are searching for but not typically distributed at Walmart elevating our profile as a digital shopping destination. And in India, Flipkart's e-commerce platform continues to scale, growing first time e-commerce customers and expanding its reach in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Flipkart's e-cart business now includes more than 35,000 Kirana partners as well as providing fulfillment services for Flipkart sellers and other third parties.  Moving to advertising, our global advertising business delivered strong growth of over 30% in Q1. In the U.S., Walmart Connect advertising sales increased nearly 40% as we experience strong momentum and new advertisers, particularly from marketplace sellers. And the number of three piece sellers utilizing our ad capabilities has doubled over the past 12 months. Sam's Club ad business called Member Access Platform grew double-digits with the number of active advertisers up more than 50% versus last year. Advertisers are responding to our recently launched in club sales attribution feature which provides advertisers with clear insights on the returns of digital ads been both online and in clubs while enhancing member experience. And in international, the advertising business continued to show strength, led by Flipkart ads, which was up over 50%.  And lastly, membership. Sam's Club member counts have had a multiyear run of robust growth with another record high achieved in Q1. Member counts have grown nearly 30% over the past three years and we're increasingly attracting greater numbers of millennials and Gen Z. We also like the trends we're seeing from Walmart Plus members. Nearly 50% of our Walmart Plus members are coming from the online pickup and delivery channel. Members spend more than non-members. They shop with us more frequently and the membership deepens engagement, helps enable personalization, and allows us to offer more services and to provide more offers on things that are important to our customers. Turning back to the middle of the P&L, SG&A expenses leveraged 58 basis points aided by strong sales growth across the enterprise, a continued focus on managing cost into moderating sales growth as inflation lessens, and lapping some COVID related wage cost in the U.S. last year. Taking all this together, our operating income grew more than 17%. This is relative to sales growth of nearly 8%, which resulted in operating margin expansion of 34 basis points, reinforcing the financial framework that we laid out at our Investor Day. As signaled when we issued FY 2024 guidance in February, several below the line items impacted our Q1 earnings results including higher net interest expense. Q1 net interest expense was more than $550 million and we issued 5 billion of debt at favorable rates.  Non-controlling interest was also higher in the quarter due in part to stronger results from Walmex. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was better than we expected as sales outpaced our plan and cost leverage exceeded plan. GAAP EPS was $0.62, the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects an $0.85 impact from unrealized gains and losses on equity investments. The team continued to do a good job managing inventory and we ended the quarter down 7%, including a more than 9% decline in Walmart U.S. Managing cost and inventory are two of the key controllables as we navigate an uncertain macro environment. We're improving inventory efficiency and merchandise flow and addressing placement in order to better serve customers, improve store in stock levels, while also mitigating future risks if demand softens.  Let me take a moment to discuss our returns or specifically return on investment or ROI which declined by 120 basis points this quarter. We calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis. As such, the decline in Q1 is a result of nearly 4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together these negatively impacted the first quarter ROI by about 140 basis points. These will again be a headwind in Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q3. As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher. At our Investor Day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1. For Walmart U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7.4% reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth and store fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales. Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories including lawn and garden. Gross margins decreased 41 basis points primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year's elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double-digits in food categories. It's important to remember that while year-over-year inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets. Share gains and grocery continued, including from higher income households as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience. We're also seeing market share gains in the areas of general merchandise where we've invested to improve the customer experience such as entertainment and automotive. In this environment as customers manage household budgets more tightly and are biasing spending toward everyday essentials, we're reinforcing our value proposition across the merchandise offering, including seasonal event savings, featuring high quality owned brands, and leaning into opening price points. For the Easter holiday, we offered customers a curated Easter meal along with a traditional Easter basket for the same price as last year. Private brand penetration and grocery categories increased nearly 110 basis points in Q1 following a 160 basis points increase in Q4 and 130 basis point increase in Q3. E-commerce sales were led by continued double-digit growth and store fulfilled pickup and delivery. Customers increasingly value convenience and speed of delivery. We have an advantage here as we leverage the proximity of our stores to fulfill and deliver digital orders to customer homes. In many cases, we can get orders delivered faster to customers while building a sustainable Omni economic model. Strong flow through on higher sales contributed to SG&A expense leverage which offset gross profit pressure, resulting in strong operating income growth of 11.7% relative to comp sales growth of 7.4%. Our international segment delivered an outstanding quarter with strong growth in both sales and profit, continuing the momentum built in the back half of last year. International grew both the top and the bottom line faster than the enterprise. Sales grew nearly 13% on a constant currency basis, led by double digit growth in China, Walmex, and Flipkart. Impressively, operating income grew more than three times faster than sales, up 41% with each market delivering year-over-year improvement. The strong profit flow through is particularly encouraging as the team has been delivering operating efficiencies on top of strong sales growth. In China sales increased 28% as the team executed well during the Chinese New Year season and also saw increased traffic as the Chinese economy reopens. Results were strong across formats and channels with continued member growth and higher member retention at Sam's Club, improved trends in hypermarkets, and more than 50% sales growth in e-commerce. Walmex had another good quarter with sales strength in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs, and e-commerce. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to expand our physical footprint, opening more than 120 stores over the past 12 months while also scaling our omnichannel capabilities. As customers desire for convenience increases, the team has rolled out a 60-minute delivery option to 80% of Walmart Supercenter and Express stores in Mexico. In India, Flipkart had strong top line results and improved its contribution profit. The team continues to expand their products and services. As an example, Flipkart Travel added to its portfolio of offerings by launching bus reservation services during the quarter through its Cleartrip platform and already is capable of offering 1 million bus connections to customers. And we continue to be pleased with PhonePe's great performance. During the quarter, we reached an important milestone with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, eclipsing the 1 trillion level for the first time. For Sam's Club, U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7% in Q1.  In addition to solid increases in both transaction and ticket, Sam's e-commerce sales were up 19%, led by strong growth in curbside. Sam's delivered another quarter of record member counts and membership income growth was 6.3%. Plus member penetration also hit an all-time high during the quarter. And it was terrific to celebrate the 40th birthday of Sam's Club during the quarter with member promotions and events. We saw incredible response from our existing and new members including the largest quarterly membership sign-up on record. Operating income declined slightly as a result of an inflation-related LIFO charge of $48 million. Without that charge, operating income would have increased 10%.  At our investment community meeting in April, I outlined our plan to grow operating income faster than sales centered on three strategic building blocks of our financial objectives. First, we're focused on driving organic sales growth from our omnichannel business model. It's clear, our omni model is resonating with customers across income demographics who are seeking out Walmart digitally and in stores, curbside and via delivery, and we're growing mine share for our convenience, which nearly matches our mine share for price. As we continue to scale digital capabilities in our markets around the world, we have an opportunity to drive significant growth in the top line over the coming years.  The second component of our financial model is to diversify our earnings streams through improved product and business mix. To improve product mix, we're focused on increasing sales penetration in higher-margin categories like apparel and home through the expansion of our e-commerce marketplace assortment and an upgraded presentation and experience in our remodeled stores. Our e-commerce assortment has grown to include over 200 million SKUs in apparel and nearly 60 million in home categories. In our newest remodeled supercenters, take a differentiated approach to showcasing general merchandise with more brand shops, digital displays, mannequins, wider aisles and updated fixtures. We're very encouraged by the early reads on customer response to these initiatives, and we plan to update 300 stores with these features this year. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we're making progress in improving our business mix as we scale a portfolio of highly attractive growth initiatives that reinforce our core retail model and will directly reshape our e-commerce and enterprise profit trajectory. This set of initiatives drive stronger returns and includes advertising, data, and membership in many markets. Collectively, these initiatives generate operating margins that are appreciably higher than our core business, and we expect we'll begin to positively influence operating profit growth relative to sales growth this year. The third building block of the model includes improving returns by scaling proven high-return investments in our supply chain that drive operating leverage and improve incremental margins. We're investing capital to optimize our distribution and fulfillment nodes with automation that we expect will drive a significant improvement in unit economics in the coming years. Our capital structure and cash flow generation are an advantage, and we're allocating capital responsibly with a bias towards increasing returns.  I'll reiterate what I said at our Investor Day, we like our strategic position. Over time, we expect revenue growth across a diversified set of drivers, improved category mix, and increasingly accretive business mix, coupled with improved unit economics. This is all fueled by supply chain investments with attractive payback cycles. We expect the outcome will be operating income growing faster than sales. Turning to guidance. There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty looking out over the balance of this year as macro pressures on the consumer have gradually intensified. As such, we continue to maintain a prudent approach to our outlook while, at the same time, having a high level of confidence in what we can control. It's also not our historic practice to always update guidance exiting Q1, and we don't necessarily want to establish precedent. But we think in this unique environment, it's important to provide an ongoing framework as our views evolve. We're raising our full year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and our expectations for Q2.  We now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 3.5%. Our expectations are for Walmart U.S. and International to grow slightly faster than our prior view, and for Sam's Club growth to be consistent with our February guidance. We expect operating income and constant currency to increase approximately 4% to 4.5%, including an expected 100 basis point impact from LIFO charges. And we estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.10 to $6.20, including an expected $0.14 impact from LIFO.  There are also a few changes below the line. Our recent debt issuance yielded a more favorable interest rate than estimated, and as such, our net interest expense is expected to grow $600 million versus last year. NCI or non-controlling interest is expected to be closer to a $0.20 drag to EPS year-over-year, including strength in Walmex. And our tax expectations have moved toward the upper end of our prior range at approximately 26.5%. Looking at Q2, we're offering the following view : net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 4%. Operating income in constant currency is expected to decline approximately 2% versus last year. Excluding the $173 million benefit from Walmart Chile insurance proceeds last year, operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be flat to up slightly. As you compare EPS versus the prior year, we're lapping the $0.05 benefit from Chile insurance proceeds and other income and $0.05 from JD's dividend and other gains and losses, resulting in a total of $0.10 of comparable EPS headwinds. We expect adjusted EPS of $1.63 to $1.68 in Q2 this year. In closing, the year is off to a good start. We're positioning our business to succeed with an expanding omni ecosystem that allows us to grow our top and bottom line throughout any economic environment. If the consumer environment tightens further, we have a compelling value proposition with everyday low prices and a suite of conveniences to continue to gain wallet share. If the macro environment improves, we have the opportunity to sell more general merchandise and improve our margin mix through both our first-party stores and e-commerce and third-party marketplace businesses. And the transformation of our business mix towards higher-margin streams of value is underway, helping to protect our profits today and to drive better profit growth in the future. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders' meeting activities next month here in Northwest Arkansas. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my questions. Given the prospect of this inflation and the increasingly difficult traffic comparison and consumer environment that you're facing over the rest of the year, how much do you expect you will need to invest in price and other actions in order to maintain an overall stable comp in the U.S. in the coming quarters? And has -- how have you factored these investments into your updated guidance and is it fair to think that given your commentary around doing better than the 2% to 2.5% prior expectation for the Walmart U.S. comp that it could be as high as 4% to 5%, just given the momentum of that business? Thank you so much. John Furner : Hey, good morning Michael, it's John Furner. I want to start first by thanking our entire team for delivering a strong quarter and investing in the future. At the same time, it was great to see both of those things happen. First, let me just reiterate our purpose of the company is to help people save money and live better. And certainly, in the last few quarters, we have kind of seen new shoppers. As John David mentioned, many are higher income and younger and those shoppers are coming to us looking for value. I think what's important for us as we look forward is price is really important to the Walmart shopper. We are pleased with the price gaps that we see in the market. Those are consistent with where they have been the last few quarters. Certainly, some shifting that you heard about earlier from brands to private brands. And then most important right now is the flexibility that we offer consumers all across the country. We've seen quite a few customers shift to pick up in delivery. Our transaction count has been strong. And as far as our plan, the rest of the year, of course, we have built into the planned room for adjustments should the consumer change or the macro environment change. As we mentioned, some softness in general merchandise, strength in food and consumables, we could -- we'll be able to manage things well, should that continue. We certainly think weather and other factors have played into some of our mix shifts. So we have a plan that will enable us to deliver value across the entire year. Doug McMillon : Michael, this is Doug. I'll just add to what John said to remind everybody when we were together in Florida, we talked about this being a bit of a pivot where our investments are more focused on capital investments than income statement investments. And we'll continue to proceed to invest in the supply chain, things we talked about a few weeks ago, of course, but also remind you about our remodel investments. So I think that when I think of the word investment, I think more about those things than I do necessarily income state investments -- income statement investments.  I think the other thing I would say is it's a great time just to be a really good merchant. Like in our stores, when I think about general merchandise, whether that's apparel or hard lines, we're focusing our store leadership and our store associates on standing tall in those areas. And because inventory is in a better spot than it was last summer, for example, they can focus more on that rather than just dealing with the flow of inventory that was coming in. So we can impact mix and do other things to drive our business beyond just considering income statement investments. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Bank. Katharine McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. We wondered if we could ask around quarter-to-date trends for sales and if the moderation from Q1 has continued? And can you remind us when the mix lap starts to get easier with consumables? John David Rainey : Sure, Kate. This is John David. The second quarter or rather the first quarter, the way that progressed is, as I noted in my remarks, we saw moderation as we went through the quarter. February was stronger and March and April were a bit of a tick down, and that follows some of the trends that we saw and other consumer behavior related to like SNAP benefits, tax refunds and such. This quarter has started off basically how the last quarter ended. So nothing notable really to say about the shift that we've seen thus far. In terms of mix, mix is going to continue to be an impact on us this year. We began to -- I think it was most pronounced in the mid part of last year, where we saw the effect of that. And certainly, as we got into the back half of the year and consumer pocketbooks were continuing to be stretched. We saw that shift in our business pre-pronounced from food to general merchandise. The thing that I will say that's different this year is it's not just a shift to food and consumables, we've also seen in the first quarter a shift to health and wellness more. And part of that is related to these GLP-1 drugs that are to treat diabetes. We're certainly seeing an uptick in that for us that comes at a lower margin, and so that has some impact on our business as well. Doug McMillon : I think the persistent inflation in dry grocery and consumables is the biggest issue. When you think about what we're up against and what will lap, we started to see inflation occur in the back half of 2021. It accelerated in the beginning of 2022 much faster than what we expected to get to a higher level than what we expected. Since then, you've seen general merchandise start to come back down, but dry grocery and consumables have held. And so as a customer, particularly if it's a customer living paycheck to paycheck, they now have a two-year stack that's a problem and eventually becomes a three-year stack that's a problem. So working with those suppliers that are on the prepared foods and consumable categories to get costs down more as fast as we possibly can would help them drive unit volume, would help us with mix and free up cash for customers to use for discretionary goods. And that's what we're focused on, have been focused on, and it's just taking longer in those categories than we want. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Oliver Chen : Hi, thank you. The tech-enabled retail ecosystems continues to scale really impressively. What are some of the key priorities for advertising in marketplace and how they may intersect with artificial intelligence as well as -- helping the margin mix? And a follow-up for Judith, China continues to be really impressive on sustained momentum as well as better margins. Just highlights about how that reopening has gone relative to your expectations and any thoughts on India as well? Thank you. John Furner : Oliver, it's John. First, really proud of the team for the performance in e-commerce in the first quarter. The 27% is something they should all feel great about. That's a combination of a few things. We noted the growth in pickup and delivery, the significant growth in marketplace sellers. And I think what's encouraging behind that number are the number of sellers who are using the services that we offer like our fulfillment services, which gets more of the assortment delivered in one or two days, and we see a pretty significant increasing conversion rates when a seller is using fulfillment services you can deliver within two days, that also leads to growth in the advertising business. This ability that the team has developed for sellers and suppliers to reach groups of customers that are targeted, it's really improving and I think that's definitely driving the results there. So those business units, the way we've described them, they do help overall mix. At the same time, we have some mix challenges as John David mentioned. But within the mix challenges in the first, which is a real positive, is the performance of the supply chain. The supply chain versus last year is in much better shape. The team is performing. So there's a lot of tailwind that's coming from our supply chain team and they're ahead of our internal plan. So that's a real positive. And then as John David mentioned, there's the mix issue that we're seeing between food, consumables, and general merchandise and then growth of health and wellness at a lower margin. Judith McKenna : Hi Oliver, just on that first point on the kind of tech-enabled ecosystem and marketplace. We've seen some really strong progress on that internationally with a lot of leverage from U.S. learnings that we've been able to apply particularly from a marketplace perspective where we're building out a global marketplace capability. We've just launched Walmart fulfillment services in a number of our markets. So that's really been enabling that on the ecosystem. India is probably one of the better examples that we have, although Walmex has been another great example of building out that ecosystem. Putting the customer at the center of it and using our digital capabilities to figure out how we serve them best in a simple and effective manner. And you heard John David talk about the work that we're doing, for example, in travel, where we can also cross-sell in India for products well in our marketplace at the same time is selling tickets for people, whether that be for air or for buses, which we've just launched. And as far as China is concerned, they undoubtedly had a very strong quarter. It was one of the important drivers of the quarter performance for International, although we saw strength across the board from most of our markets. In particular, as you commented, the reopening of Chinese New Year, for Chinese New Year made a profound effect on the quarter. Just to give you an idea of the scale of what happened there and the response of our teams, we had all of our product positioned for a Chinese New Year event based in the cities where most people were. What happened is actually everybody went home into the more rural areas. And our team had to pivot completely within a 10-day window and reallocate all of the inventory that we had around the country. It was a remarkable asset, which just demonstrated their agility and resilience. The Chinese economy is still patches. Undoubtedly, consumer sentiment, if you look externally, is better than it was, not all the way to bright yet pre-COVID, but both of our businesses there are benefiting from the reopening. So Sam's Club continues to do well. We have six new clubs opening this year. And then on hypers, really focusing on doubling down on how we think about fulfilled -- store fulfilled for e-commerce. That e-commerce penetration remains at about 40%, which is a slight softening from where it was, but that's also partly seasonal because of the Chinese New Year time. On India, as Doug commented, we were there recently, both Flipkart and PhonePe continue to impress us and meet our expectation. The build-out of the ecosystem for Flipkart, I think we've talked about, but it's PhonePe, it's really impressive to see their results as well, leveraging over the 1 trillion TPV mark, 36 million merchants online, and enabling those merchants to be able to grow their businesses as well was really impressive to see. What we're seeing in India is a build-out of an ecosystem in its own right between our tech capabilities, between our sourcing capabilities, Flipkart and PhonePe, it's becoming a mutually reinforcing flywheel of strength for that market, and we're excited on what they're going to do in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good morning. I have a question for John David. The Q2 outlook, can you share if expectations has changed at all since you guided the full year and relatedly, you talked about how the second half spread with EBIT for sales growth should be stronger than the first half, can you talk about does that shape or that spread change at all, does it widen, or roughly stay the same? John David Rainey : Sure, Simeon. Good to speak with you. You might recall on our last earnings call we gave a little bit of a head nod into Q2 performance because of some of the specific issues that occurred in Q2 last year. And we said that at the time, we expected it to be roughly flat. Right now, we're saying the guidance is -- and I'm speaking about operating income, down 2%. That's most impacted by, again, the insurance proceeds that we received last year. Mix will continue to be an issue in 2Q. We do see some improvement in some of our supply chain costs, freight costs that we're benefiting from. But that's anomalous quarter for us as you think about this year.  As we get into the back half of the year and we see a more pronounced impact from some of the initiatives that we discussed at our Investor Day around these higher-margin, higher growth areas, that will begin to have a more outsized impact. But relative to where we were in the last quarter, the expectation for that inflection has not changed. We still expect that to be about the same. It just so happens that, frankly, we just outperformed on the operating income line in the first quarter relative to what we thought. So really, really strong performance there. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Good morning, thanks for taking our questions. John David, you mentioned the 360 basis point mix shift between food and general merchandise and you kind of touched on it a little bit, but should we expect that Q1 is the peak of that mix pressure and should that moderate throughout the year, just help us understand what's in your plan? And then also on general merchandise, can you just help us understand what you're seeing in terms of units versus net pricing at this point and also the 300 stores that you're rolling out the new general merchandise initiative to, can you share the lift that you're seeing there? John David Rainey : Sure. I'm writing down all these questions here, Kelly. So first on mix shift, I don't think it's fair to assume that the first quarter is necessarily going to be the peak. When we gave our full year guidance, you might recall that we talked about an additional incremental impact relative to the 330-ish basis points we had last year. And so I think we'll continue to see that through the year. A lot of that too, depends upon consumer behavior, which is difficult to predict at best right now, and our guidance assumes a rather cautious outlook there.  On units, if you just take the first quarter and you break it down by segment, both Sam's in the U.S. where if you look at it like, say, real sales, they were basically flat. The International segment, I believe, was up around 6%, 6.5% inflation adjusted. So certainly, we're seeing the impact of higher prices and the effect of consumer behavior on purchasing as it relates to units. And then with respect to the stores that we're remodeling, before I answer this, I just want to caution that we're early on here. We've only done a couple of stores, but very excited about the results. We've seen a quite sizable increase, couple of percentage points in terms of uplift of sales. Now to be clear, that would be expected in any store where you do a remodel, you're going to see that initial uptick. I think what we need to continue to monitor is how that levels out over time. But when -- if you got the chance to go into one of these stores, you certainly recognize the difference that it is versus the rest of the network and so we're quite excited about this and the early response. Kelly Bania : How many stores have been done so far? John Furner : Well, we have a couple of dozen now that are around the country. And what we did is piloted here in Arkansas, then we went to the Northeast, and we put these now in a number of markets. And additionally, what's encouraging beyond just the merchandising, whether it's the great brands that you see in apparel or layouts, a lot of really exciting changes. What we see is success in a number of markets. So we think this has more broad appeal than perhaps what we may have believed when we did the first one. So the program is going well, and we see several hundred of these in construction and on the way this year. Kelly Bania : As it relates to the GM versus food and consumables mix, you might comment on what you're seeing in e-commerce general merchandise, and then how you would answer the question for Walmart U.S. specifically, how you view Q2 through Q4 as it relates to that mix? John Furner : Yes, definitely some interesting points when you dig into that, Doug. General merchandise is certainly stronger in e-commerce and stronger in the marketplace. The trend, as John David said, for the quarter to date was just a couple of weeks is very reflective of what was happening at the end of the first quarter. But where we have new items, new brands, we have a lot of examples of digitally native brands that we found somewhere in the media or social media that are doing well, that actually is inclusive in food as well. And so the mix right now, as I said earlier, has some positives between supply chain. Food has definitely grown faster along with the consumables. The health and wellness growth is something that we didn't really expect going into the year that has accelerated quite a bit over the last couple of months. And so as we look forward, some of the things that are harder to tell right now, the general merchandise impact has been going on for the last three quarters or so, but there are impacts from other things like tax refunds, the weather, some funds out there. So a little unclear how much of this is temporary in the month that we're in versus what we'll see the rest of the year. But I certainly expect that just the trends in food and consumables and the strength that we have in those as well as health and wellness will persist over the next few quarters. I think that if anything, health and wellness, the impact that it's having on the mix and penetration could get larger based on the growth rates you're seeing in these drug types that John David mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to go back to your U.S. e-commerce acceleration during the quarter. What are you seeing from a category perspective and then for the balance of the year, do you also expect to continue significant contribution to your U.S. comp from e-commerce? John Furner : Hi Rupesh, definitely I'm excited about the quarter. The team has done a lot of work in the last year to improve overall customer experience. We measure something called CX scores, which looks at our assortment, the number of sellers, the quality of the product display pages, and they are really in the details of the business. And the last quarter acceleration really across the board in e-commerce, pickup and delivery were very strong. But we do look at this entire business as part of the total omnichannel offering, and that's really important because when we talk about pickup and delivery at stores, that does include e-commerce orders where a customer is ordering something in general merchandise, it just happened to be that the merchandise, the items are in the store. So in effect, we shortened the last mile, which helps not only speed and time, but also helps the cost of the transaction.  Categories though that are strong, we've been strong in food and consumables, really encouraged by accelerations in marketplace in categories like apparel, some acceleration in certain home categories, that's great to see. And I think that will continue as both the seller count and the item count continue to expand. So we're really looking at customer channel and driving the business with search to ensure that the customer gets whatever they want when they want it from Walmart. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Okay guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I'll just pile them all into one here. I guess I was wondering, obviously, you guys have brought out some brand partnerships and exclusive partnerships. How do you see that evolving store within a store, it seems like there's a lot of opportunity in certain categories like electronics and pet? That's the first one. The second one is Walmart Plus adding benefits, and do you see that as a driver of more high-income consumers? And three, is just the grocery climate. You've been taking a lot of share from some of your bigger competitors in traditional grocery and do you think they're ever going to respond? And that's it. Thanks. John Furner : Hey, good morning, Scott. First, let me take all three of these. First, brands, we really like the brand shops that we set up physically in stores that are in the remodel. I know you've seen a few but the results are really encouraging. I think additionally, in apparel, what I really liked that the team did is they brought everything together for the customer. So if you're in the men's shop, you'll see the brands at the front of the department, men's denim just behind it; shoes, accessories, all there together, so we're traditionally we've broken these things up by category. Now they're more holistic. Pets are certainly exciting with some of the things that are coming. Then online, you'll start -- you will see now and you'll see a lot more in the future, a lot of branded shops inside the digital experience, which enables brands to be able to put their entire assortment online whether it's first P -- 1P that's online or sold in the store, the rest of the assortment there can be shop by brand. And I think these are -- they're going really well. The first dozen or so are pretty exciting.  Walmart Plus continue to make progress. It's an important part of the offers. It's not the only thing that we're doing, obviously, but it's an important part of the offer. We're encouraged by the growth of new members. And importantly, what we are really ensuring on these new members is that we are helping them see the entire path to get to all the benefits we offer. The core offer of course, is based in deliveries that are unlimited without cost once you buy into the membership, that's the most important thing that we get right. We measure ourselves really carefully in something we call the perfect order, which is exactly what you ordered on time. And then we continue to work on things like substitutions. And then the last thing on grocery, we're focused on ensuring that our stores are in stock each and every day. We feel better about the supply chain versus a year ago. That would include in-stock availability, but also include the cost of supply chain. Stores I've been at recently from Virginia to New Mexico and Texas and Tennessee are seeing much better execution in grocery and in stock availability, which does help the order fillers and order pickers, which makes the Walmart Plus experience much better. So we'll really continue to focus on merchandising and pricing. Just the other day, I was with the team and saw this item called Bachan's Barbecue Sauce, which is a digitally native Japanese flavor barbecue sauce. It's just doing really well. So also, I'm just personally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life and drive sales across the country. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Seth Sigman : Hey everybody, good morning. My question is really on advertising. I think it's a relatively small quarter for this, but the 40% growth obviously it's accelerating. It's very impressive. Can you elaborate on that and what you're doing to drive that? And then maybe more specifically for Sam's, the advertising opportunity there, seeing a lot of growth in sellers on map there so can you see the opportunity? Thank you. John Furner : Good morning. So first, I'll talk about Walmart U.S. with advertising. There's been considerable momentum really that started last year when we launched our second place auction capability. So this is a -- it's a two-sided market but ultimately, what we're trying to do is connect our sellers, our suppliers to customers, and that can be at the one to one level, it can be at the cohort level. And so the team has done a lot to really increase our capacity and capability to handle those transactions really well. What's driving it, of course, over time we will be better -- a stronger, bigger marketplace. So more marketplace sellers and helping them connect to customers and then more assortment, that's easier to find with surge and also helps the advertising business grow. And I'll turn it over to Judith to talk about international. Judith McKenna : Yes. So same story really, which is, as the eco system builds out, it continues to be better strength in our advertising businesses everywhere. So the Flipkart growth is about 50% year-on-year, but Walmex equally had very strong growth at about 64% year-on-year. So those businesses continue to grow. We continue to learn and learn new skills about how to best serve the advertisers who wants to come on to our platform. And I think that's one of the areas that we've seen a lot of good global leverage and global learning as well to really help reinforce that. Kathryn McLay : Yes. And I'll just say from the Sam's. We talk about -- it's a little bit different from Sam's and that we don't have a marketplace. But what we are doing is stitching together, you have our e-com growth, and then you need to also look at our Scan and Go growth because both of those are indicative of a digitally enabled sale. And so what we've been doing is working with our advertising community on how do you influence the sales whether they are in club or off-line, online or offline. And you can nudge, you can encourage, you can advertise. And now we're giving those advertisers visibility to the in-club sales and the online sales and stitching them together. They're seeing this lift on their return on advertising spend. So it's a different model to what John and Judith have, but we're happy with the tools and capabilities we're building out and how that's resonating with our advertisers. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Kelly, please proceed with your question. Edward Kelly : Yeah hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. As we think about gross margin and progression through the year, could you maybe give us a little bit more color on how some of the pieces progress, we think about things like freight markdowns, how that might influence the P&L in the back half? And then related to Shrink, you haven't spoken about Shrink, we have heard it, others -- it seems like it's a big industry issue. Just kind of curious as to how that's impacting you? Thank you. John Furner : Yes, I'll take it. Good morning. First, supply chain. In the first quarter, we definitely felt a tailwind from supply chain versus prior periods and including the execution all across the business. It becomes more of an issue as we lap Q2 last year. Q2 last year and late Q1 last year would have been the peak of inventories. We worked through a backlog of something like 100,000 containers that had been delayed at ports. So lapping those costs gets bigger as you look forward to the next quarter or so. And then as you get into the back half of the year, things tend to normalize a bit.  As far as markdowns, last year, we had markdown pressure throughout the entire year as we unloaded that freight and moved it from the ports to the distribution centers, to the stores and through the entire chain. So the markdown comparisons will moderate slightly forward. But every year, including this year, we always leave room for seasonal markdowns and at the end of each season, we want to ensure that we are clean on inventory so that we don't carry any liabilities for it. And what happens when that happens is it makes it harder to set the next season, which backs things up. So we'll stay really focused on taking markdowns on time. In fact, in some categories like apparel, we're pulling some markdowns forward within the quarter to take advantage of the traffic that we'll see over the Memorial Day holiday. So this is something that we pay a lot of attention to. The last part of your question, can you repeat again, please? Edward Kelly : Shrink. John Furner : Shrink. Sorry, there were several in there. On Shrink, no, it is a factor -- mix as I said a few moments ago, is affected by supply chain, it's affected by food, consumable, general merchandise mix and then health and wellness. So below that level, there is a core shrink. And as we've said in the past, it's been challenging for us. It's been challenging really for all of retail. So we're going to actively manage this issue. We always do, we always have, and we're going to continue to take the steps that are reasonable and required to make sure we're protecting our customers, protecting our associates, and protecting our assets and inventory. We know a lot of communities have been affected by this, but it's also important to note that retail can't solve this issue all on its own. It will take communities stepping up and enforcing the law to be able to bring this issue back under control. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much. I had one clarification and then one question. John David, I think in your remarks, you made a comment that alternative investments will protect profits and that comment is a little different from the Analyst Day where I believe it would be additive and not subsidizing, I guess, for a lack of a better word, so wanted to clarify that? But then bigger question I had is, could you maybe give a little color on what the spend pattern is with the higher income demographics and maybe you could quantify what you think their share is today versus -- what your share is with them today versus prior to the pandemic? John David Rainey : Certainly, Karen. To clarify my comments in the prepared remarks, all of these, first of all, work together. I think it's hard to just look at core retail and then separate out advertising, membership, fulfillment services. They are mutually reinforcing, which is what makes them so attractive to us. And it's those very new businesses that we think will make our profits inflect in terms of the growth rate relative to sales going forward. So the protect profits that -- please don't read too much into that, that's -- we clearly are excited about this part of our business, and this is the opportunity to have our profits grow faster than sales. On the high income cohort, I'll start there, and maybe John or others might want to jump in. But that was probably most pronounced. And by that, I mean, the shift that we saw, it was most pronounced in the second quarter last year. When we got to the third and the fourth quarter, there was a little more balance between the various income cohorts in terms of share gain. And that's what we saw in the most recent quarter as well. But I think the big story here is that -- that\u2019s around how our value proposition for convenience is resonating. We've always been known for price, but I think the steps we've taken in the last three to five years to expand our e-commerce capabilities, to expand online pickup and delivery, you see that resonate with customers. And it doesn't matter what your monthly income is, everybody values convenience the same. So that's the big takeaway here. And I think it's an important point as you think about the future of Walmart as we have these new shoppers coming to us, as we have higher income shoppers coming to shop for not only grocery but general merchandise, we want to retain those. We want to retain them with better experiences, better product offerings, and we're seeing that in the actions that we're taking today. John Furner : And we spend a lot of time, of course, working on ensuring that we have flexible options for any customer. And in the case of the group that you asked about, we definitely see in the data that there is a higher usage of e-commerce and pickup and delivery. And then when you click into the things they're buying, you do see some differences. So we do see within pickup and delivery, higher purchase rates of categories like [indiscernible] versus regular Grade B. So you see trade-ups and then if we see it in apparel, definitely seeing some growth in apparel and marketplace. And that is definitely being driven by some of our newer higher income customers. I'm really excited about the growth of not only transactions, but the number of digital users that we have on year-on-year which is accelerating. Kathryn McLay : Yes. And I had to say, I think there's a couple of behavioral trends that we're keeping an eye on. So I do think our lower price point units like, say, in patio sell quicker and what we're seeing is people being very choiceful about where they spend their money, but they're also shopping a lot later. So in the past, when we fit patio, it sold really quickly. And now we're seeing people wait a little bit later into the season. We're seeing that like with Mother's Day sales. So those demand profiles are looking a lot like they used to in 2018-2019 versus pandemic spend. So people are buying a little later. We also saw kind of cooler weather, which kind of changed the shape of how people are buying. But what we are seeing is that where you get this really fabulous quality value equation right, sales are up. So we're looking at beef brisket at the other day. Our beef brisket AUR is down 17%. Our tonnage is up 29%. Our roses are amazing value. Roses sales are up 60%. So where you get this great kind of value-quality combination together, we're seeing members engage and spend and also I've been looking at kind of convenience and traffic drivers, hot baked pizzas in our cafes are up 29%. So there are areas where you see if you get that quality equation, you can drive traffic into the club, and we're just watching cautiously as how they spend on those bigger ticket items and when those sales will come. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Gregory Melich : Alright, thanks. I wanted to follow up on inflation because it seemed to be a theme on your prepared comments. I guess, what is the outlook when you talk to the merchants for inflation, both in grocery and across the store and what can Walmart do to sort of help alleviate that? And then is the industry being rational in terms of pricing and promotion? John Furner : Yes, as you look forward, it's important to compare what we've been up against the last couple of years. And if you go all the way back into late 2021, that's when we started to see prices starting to rise. And then in 2022 February, March and April it was quite acute, obviously, and rose at a rate that we weren't expecting going into the year with the peak of inflation. And in year [ph], in July and August of last year, we saw high double digits in categories like food and consumables. And as you get into the period that we're in now, we're still seeing around high single digits to double digits in parts of dry grocery and other places. But when you add that up over the three years, it gets to be a really high number, which is clearly driving part of the shift. The way we think of value, first, we are always comparing ourselves to the prices that are out in the market. We feel good about our price positioning. The second, we've been able to look at key holidays like Thanksgiving last year, Easter that we just went through, and we've been able to keep a number of items on either a rollback program or base prices where customers can buy key important holiday meals at the same price that they bought them for the year before. As you look forward, it's not easy to predict. Clearly, we are not happy with the inflation that we see in categories like dry grocery and those persist as you get into the later part of the second quarter and third quarter, the in-year number may look lower because we'll be comparing to get such high numbers last year. But it's important to keep in mind that the two year stack at that point, we still think will be in the mid-20s. So consumer is under a lot of stress. Therefore, we see the shift to private brand that John mentioned -- John David mentioned in his earlier remarks, so shift this year than the year before and the year before, there was more of a shift than 2021. So that trend continues. Doug McMillon : We can be good mix managers within food but across the box as well from for the U.S. and around the world. General merchandise prices, as they're coming down, present an opportunity leading down, number one. Number two, finding items and categories that have above-average margins and shaving the margin off there to mix sales up as customers want to buy discretionary items, we are in a position to be able to show them value through the rest of this year that they might not find elsewhere, we can be aggressive there. Private brand share is another thing. You're seeing that number come up. We have more influence over what's happening with private brands than we do with branded product. And we do need some of these branded suppliers that are in dry grocery and consumables to get top line focused more than they have been for a while. It's a generalization, not everybody is in the same place, but we're looking for those that want to be aggressive. So if we can make a difference on dry grocery and consumables, lead with general merchandise and then deal with what's happening in the fresh food categories, which are less consistent, more volatile that some are up, some are down relative to dry grocery and consumables, that's the way we pull off a basket that generates the best value for our customers. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will be from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks guys. Last year, 2022, you gave some numbers around SKU count, big increases in SKU count and marketplace throughout the year. I'm curious if you can give us an update on your total SKU count currently and how do you expect that to change in 2023 and beyond? And if you can give any color what percent of your marketplace customers can you also count as advertising and fulfillment services customers and what the targets are there? Thanks. John Furner : Sure. Good growth in the marketplace in the U.S. and there may be other comments on other markets. But a lot of growth last year. SKU count, as I mentioned late, I think it was Q4, Q1, both in the $400 million range. We expect that to grow probably not at the rate that it grew last year. We made a lot of progress in both SKU count and seller count. And there is continued acceleration with a number who are using fulfillment services and advertising. What's important about both of those services is, let me start with fulfillment, it helps with the customer time to promise and it helps customers know when they're going to receive their item. Customers want to get their delivery when they ordered it. They don't want it early. They don't want it late. They want it the day of. And when sellers move their assortment, their inventory, into our fulfillment channels, then it's more certain for a customer that it's going to be next-day delivery or two-day delivery. And that just helps with conversion rates. So if you're a marketplace seller and you want to know how to drive business at Walmart, it's to list on the marketplace, the inventory and fulfillment services. And then Walmart Connect is just a great way for the seller to be able to find audiences, targeted audiences who are looking for products in categories like the ones they're offered. So it's really the three of those things that are put -- that they all come together that make the customer experience much greater and the data supports everything I just described. Judith McKenna : From an international perspective on marketplaces, we continue to see SKU growth across Mexico and Canada, but both of those marketplaces are quite nascent in their development and provide a lot of opportunity for the future. Walmex added 50% of SKUs in Q1 versus the same time in the previous year. Of course, our most mature marketplace is in India, which has hundreds of millions of products on that. It continues to find new ways to serve customers. But when they recently launched Flipkart fulfillment services, that connectivity between the advertising, providing the services to help sellers wherever they are in India be able to get items to customers and our business is working really well. Again, we've only recently launched that, and we're already seeing really good traction right across the country. Doug McMillon : This is Doug. I think I'll go ahead and wrap up here. We ran a little over. I hope that's okay. I appreciate your questions. I'm grateful to work with such a strong team, the people that have been on this call, but all those that are work in our stores and clubs and throughout the company. I think you can see in our results that we've got a very strong and capable team and one that can adapt to environments. There have been a lot of pivots over the last few years, in particular, and they've done a terrific job of navigating all of that. We feel strong about our position to grow the top line. We're positioned to serve customers and members how they want to be served. I think the e-comm growth this quarter being up 20% -- 26% is an example of that. But if they want to come to stores and clubs, we're there. If they want to do a pickup order, we're there. If they want to have it delivered, we can do that. We are positioned to grow profit faster than sales through productivity and through the mix of businesses, caring in an additive way. And then on ROI, we'll be disciplined with capital, but we are excited about our opportunities to invest and really grateful that you all came down to Florida. So many of you and saw what we were doing there. And we'll just wrap up by inviting you to comment in a couple of weeks. We'll show you an MFC. We'll go to a store. We'll go to a club. We'll answer more of your questions. We feel like we're in a position to outperform and to continue to outperform because of the work that's been done to date and our ability to manage the business and pivot as we need to looking forward. Thanks for your attention today. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin. Steph Wissink : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. We're excited to discuss with you the results of a strong second quarter and our upwardly revised outlook for the year. Joining me are Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, and CFO, John David Rainey. Following prepared remarks from Doug and John David, we'll take your questions. At that time, we will be joined by our segment CEOs : John Furner from Walmart U.S., Judith McKenna from Walmart International, and Kath McLay from Sam's Club. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, we are now ready to begin. Doug McMillon : Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. We had another strong quarter. We're gaining share across markets and formats, growing units sold, transaction counts are positive across markets and growth in operating income is outpacing sales. We're really pleased with our first half performance. For the quarter, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were ahead of where we thought they'd be at 6.4%. Sam's Club U.S. was 5.5% and sales for international were up 11%, led by double-digit growth at Walmex and China. Flipkart's GMV was also strong. The team is driving results in the short-term and building for the future. We're a people-led, tech-powered, omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. We like who we are and we like who we are becoming. We're positioned for growth. We can serve people how they want to be served whether that's in a store club, picking up an order curbside or having it delivered. We continue to grow some of our newer businesses which shape the overall model in a positive way, helping to enable us to grow profit faster than sales. We're setting the right capital priorities, and you can expect us to continue investing in the areas we've talked about, like technology, including automation, store and club remodels, and with new stores and clubs in select markets. As it relates to technology, our approach to new tools like generative AI is to focus on making shopping easier and more convenient for our customers and members and helping our associates enjoy more satisfying and productive work. Ultimately, the power of generative AI or any technology is only as good as the data that powers it. Our data assets are unique, and we're excited about the potential to leverage them in new and impactful ways. We're taking large language models developed by our partners and by the broader tech community and adding retail context to create models that are uniquely suited to the needs of our customers, our associates and our supply chain. We'll unlock value for shareholders through the combination of our physical automation work with our data and increasingly intelligent software. We have a sharp focus on ROI as we drive results and set our capital priorities. The financial framework we laid out at our Investment Community Meeting in April is evident in our results from the last two quarters. The remodel program I mentioned includes items to support our goal of becoming a regenerative company, as we put things like new refrigeration equipment and EV charging stations in place. I was in Chile last week where I got to participate in the grand opening of a new hydrogen plant in Santiago that supports our strong business in that country. While I'm on the subject of regeneration, we recently announced a new collaboration focused on supporting U.S. and Canadian farmers to help improve soil health and water quality. Our collective goal is to enable and accelerate the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland and deliver 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals by 2030. Some days I still get amazed by all the good work happening across our company. As a global retailer, we see how our customers and members are affected by what's happening at a macro level, and how that influences their behaviors. Jobs, wages and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers, but rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs, and tightening lending standards and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure. I was in Calgary visiting stores a couple of weeks ago, and our Canadian customers are feeling the pinch of higher interest rates faster than in the U.S. given their shorter-term mortgages. When you put all this together, we see families that are discerning about what they're spending on. They're setting priorities and spending on the things they care most about. We saw that during the first half of the year with Chinese New Year and Easter, and more recently with July 4th and the start of Back to School, where sales are ahead of plan so far. We see them buying more private brand items, and they're buying more grocery staples and in-home meal options consistent with eating at home. Our customers and members are resilient. They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them. We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories. We're encouraged by how general merchandise performed during the second quarter versus our expectations. We still expect food, consumables and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs to grow as a percent to total in the back half. But the trends we see in general merchandise sales make us feel more optimistic about those categories in the back half of the year. Our stores and clubs give us a competitive advantage and power our omnichannel model. Our curbside pickup business continues to grow as people look for ways to save time, and store-fulfilled delivery is now growing faster than pickup across all three segments. Delivery speed and accuracy are obviously important, and we lack how we're leveraging our physical assets. In the U.S., we have more than 4,000 stores and nearly 600 Sam's Clubs making same-day deliveries, and in nearly 2,000 stores and clubs internationally. We're increasingly measuring those deliveries in hours rather than days. In China, where we deliver from all our stores, nearly 80% of digital orders are delivered in under one hour. I like how we're constantly improving delivery speed. It's important to our customers and to our strategy, and I like how we're building mutually reinforcing businesses. Running great stores and scaling e-commerce are and will be our top priorities. The way we design them along with our marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising business is key. We'll keep prioritizing omni-retail, but we have good opportunities in healthcare and financial services in multiple markets. The growth of PhonePe has been fantastic, and we're building other financial products like Cashi in Mexico and through ONE here in the U.S. We continue to build our healthcare services capabilities with clinic expansion. As I look at the remainder of the year, our immediate focus is on getting product costs and retails down to fight inflation, which will help with mix, improving execution of pickup and delivery orders, expense management and inventory management by item and category. I'll wrap up by saying a big thank you to our associates. As always, they're making a difference every day for our customers and members. As we close out Back-to-school and get ready for the holidays, their execution day-to-day and commitment to our customers and members is as critical as ever. Thank you for your interest in our company. Over to you, John David. John David Rainey : Thanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong quarter with better-than-expected results in sales, operating income and adjusted EPS. Sales were strong across all segments, and we gained U.S. market share in grocery in both units and dollars, while delivering gross margin rate expansion. Our focus on saving customers' time and money continues to resonate, especially in high volume seasonal periods. We have good momentum in the business. Year-to-date, we grew sales by over 6.5%, adjusted operating income by about 12%, and adjusted EPS by roughly 8%. With our Q2 results coming in better than expected, we're increasing our full-year guidance, and we're well positioned as we enter the back half. I'll discuss guidance shortly, but first I'd like to review highlights of our Q2 results using our financial framework of growth, margins and returns. Starting with growth. For the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 5.5%, or more than $8 billion. Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel increased 6.4%, with growth in both store and digital transactions. Grocery, and health and wellness sales continued to outperform, and we are encouraged by the modest sequential improvement in general merchandise. E-commerce sales were up 24%, driven by store fulfilled pickup and delivery and advertising. We like the trends we're seeing in e-commerce. Customers are increasingly counting on us for convenience, and they're visiting our app and sites more often. In Q2, weekly active digital users grew more than 20%. Similar to Q1, consumer spending remains resilient at the headline level. Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often. We see grocery staples and in-home meal options being purchased more often. Sales of general merchandise kitchen tools like hand blenders and stand mixers have inflected higher as customers are preparing more food at home. They're also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands, and customers still want to celebrate key moments. Over the last year here in the U.S., we've partnered with suppliers to utilize rollbacks and offer select seasonal baskets of goods at the same prices as last year, essentially removing the impact of inflation. Customer response has been strong, and sales have exceeded plan for events like Memorial Day, 4 July and our Walmart Plus Week Savings event. We're taking a similar inflation-fighting approach to Back-to-school, with a basket of 14 of the most popular classroom essentials for under $13. In our international segment, sales were strong, up 11% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in Walmex, China and Flipkart. E-commerce grew 26%, and we experienced positive store traffic across markets. Similar to the U.S., customers are still pressured by elevated inflation with spend over indexing towards food and consumables. We're seeing higher private brand penetration across markets as customers globally look for a combination of value and quality. And Sam's Club U.S. comp sales excluding fuel increased more than 5% with member fee income up 7%. On margins, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points as we lapped last year's elevated levels of inventory markdowns and supply chain costs. These tailwinds were partially offset by ongoing category mix pressure, as grocery and health and wellness sales outperformed general merchandise. One of our strategic priorities is improving digital margins with an eye towards e-commerce profitability. I'm pleased with the progress we are making, particularly in Walmart U.S. contribution profit, which has been driven by fulfillment efficiencies and better product margins. We're leveraging our stores to fulfill more than 50% of digital orders, and activating our local delivery networks to get product to customers faster at lower cost. At our Investment Community Meeting in April, I said that we expected 200 basis points of improvement in contribution profit this year, and we're on track to achieve that goal. We're also pleased with performance of our higher margin growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni retail model. I'll provide highlights on each of these. First, marketplace. We're continuing to scale our marketplace in the U.S. with new items and sellers. The number of customers buying items on our marketplace increased 14% in Q2. Sales were strong in both consumables and general merchandise categories, with double-digit growth across home, apparel and hardlines, and the number of sellers utilizing our fulfillment services increased more than 50%. In Mexico, we also expanded the number of sellers and items available on the marketplace, resulting in 40% GMV growth for the quarter. In Canada, we opened our first automated e-commerce fulfillment center in Alberta, which includes Walmart Fulfillment Services and expands two-day shipping to 97% of households. And in India, Flipkart's Myntra is the country's largest e-commerce marketplace for fashion and lifestyle products, offering top brands to customers across India. Myntra now provides access to more than 6,000 brands on its marketplace. Moving to advertising. Our global advertising business delivered strong growth of approximately 35%. In the U.S., Walmart Connect sales increased 36% in Q2, and the business has nearly doubled in size over the past two years. We're seeing strong growth in sponsored ads and increased demand for in-store activation. Advertiser count grew 60%, with strong momentum in new advertisers. Sam's advertising business grew 33%. The in-club sales attribution feature for search and sponsored ads has generated strong interest from advertisers. On average, advertisers are seeing a nearly 30% improvement on the returns of digital ad spend as they gain full visibility to the member journey from intent to purchase, both online and in-clubs. And in international, the advertising business grew nearly 40%. And lastly, membership, Sam's Club U.S. member counts increased mid-single digits with strong plus membership growth in renewals as plus penetration is up 1.3 percentage points versus last year. During the quarter, we achieved record member acquisition tied to Walmart Plus Week and continued to enhance the value of the Walmart Plus membership. We introduced Walmart Plus Assist, which provides a 50% discount off the regular membership fee for customers receiving government assistance. We also partnered with Expedia Group to launch new travel benefits for members. Turning back to the middle of the P&L. As expected, SG&A expenses were higher versus last year and deleveraged 33 basis points. This reflects higher variable pay expenses relative to last year when we were below our planned performance, tech investments and increased store remodel cost in the U.S. Partially offsetting this, international expenses leveraged significantly on strong sales growth. As we increasingly utilize technology in our business, we're pleased with the performance metrics from our newly automated distribution and fulfillment notes. Our automated e-commerce fulfillment centers are achieving efficiencies of 30% higher units per hour than non-automated buildings. We're also seeing increased productivity from the more than 15% of stores now being served by automated regional distribution centers. It's early in the rollout process, but we are encouraged that some of these facilities are driving operating leverage well beyond our initial expectations. Second quarter adjusted operating income grew more than 8%, and our adjusted EPS of $1.84 was up 4%. Our plan is to grow operating income faster than sales, and our second quarter performance achieved this despite lapping the $173 million insurance settlement that benefited international's other income last year. Similar to Q1, below-the-line items were pressured by higher net interest expense, reflecting the increase in rates and noncontrolling interest due in part to stronger results from Walmex. The team continued to do a good job managing inventory, and we ended the quarter down 5%, including an 8% decline in Walmart U.S. We feel good about the progress we've made on in-stock levels as supply chain is normalized and the composition of our inventory mix is improved. We're maintaining discipline in how we're buying general merchandise during this uncertain macro environment to mitigate future risk if demand softens. ROI or return on investment, declined 100 basis points. As a reminder, we calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis, and the decline in Q2 is a result of nearly $4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year, related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together, these negatively impacted second quarter ROI by 140 basis points. As we lap these discrete charges in the coming quarters, we expect a stronger ROI inflection in the back half of the year. We're also starting to realize some benefits from productivity initiatives that were initially planned for fiscal year '25, and we continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years. I'll now briefly discuss some additional Q2 highlights for each segment. For Walmart U.S., our 6.4% sales comp included a high single-digit increase in grocery and a high-teens increase in health and wellness. Although general merchandise sales declined low single digits versus last year, these results were 300 basis points better than Q1, aided by outperformance from early Back to School shopping in our Walmart Plus savings event. We saw a 240-basis point shift in sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness in Q2. Grocery inflation moderated more than 400 basis points from Q1 levels and more than 700 basis points year-over-year to a high single digit increase as we lapped higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack, grocery inflation remained over 20%. We're encouraged by the growth in units sold, particularly in food categories where disinflation is more pronounced, such as fresh meats, seafood and eggs. In addition, private brand sales in grocery were up more than 9%, with penetration up nearly 40 basis points in Q2 and up more than 170 basis points on two-year stack. Lower markdowns and supply chain cost resulted in a gross margin rate increase of 40 basis points, despite ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. The negative impact to margin mix from outsized growth in branded drugs accelerated in Q2. Other income grew nearly 4%, led by continued growth in Walmart+memberships. And overall, Walmart U.S. operating income increased 7.6%. Our international segment delivered another impressive quarter with double-digit sales growth and strong underlying profit growth. Operating income increased 2.2%, but was negatively impacted by 20 percentage points from lapping last year's insurance recovery that I mentioned earlier. Walmex had another strong quarter with sales up 10%, reflecting strength in our Bodega stores, Sam's Club and E-commerce. E-commerce sales grew in the low 20s, with traffic up more than 5%. Walmex is an excellent example of our omnichannel retail strength across formats and channels. Bodega Aurrera is celebrating its 65th anniversary and has become the most valuable retail brand in Mexico. These Bodega stores have consistently delivered strong performance and continue to accelerate e-commerce to better serve customers, now offering more than 60,000 SKUs from 586 stores in 299 cities. In China, sales increased 22%, led by strength from Sam's Club and e-commerce. We're executing well with increased online and offline traffic across both the Sam's and hypermarket formats. In India, Flipkart delivered strong GMV and net sales growth as the core business continues to perform well. The team continues to focus on expanding the ecosystem of products and services like advertising, travel and healthcare, and on delivering continued contribution profit improvement. Flipkart's consistent progress and performance reinforces our confidence in the long-term value of this business. India is leading the largest digital transformation in the world, and Flipkart is the leading marketplace in India, and we continue to be super impressed with PhonePe's strong and consistent performance. Annualized TPV or total payment volume has surpassed $1.15 trillion, and for the first time, we processed more than 5 billion transactions in a single month. Sam's Club delivered another strong quarter with solid unit growth and e-commerce up 18%. It's encouraging to see members embrace omnichannel with strong in-club traffic gains and increasing engagement with our digital tools in and outside the Club. In Q2, utilization of Scan and Go increased 570 basis points, and curbside pickup saw double-digit growth. Similar to Walmart, sales strength at Sam's was led by grocery and healthcare categories as the members focused on value and essentials. While discretionary categories were pressured overall, items with compelling price and quality and strong value to market are driving sales. Sam's Club operating income was up 22%, due in part to lower LIFO charges. Turning to guidance. There continues to be a reasonable level of uncertainty in the economic backdrop for the balance of this year. While inflation has moderated and employment levels have been steady, credit markets have tightened, energy prices are higher, and some customers face additional expense from the resumption of student loan payments in October. As such, we continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook. We're raising our full year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3. I'll highlight the key changes, but please refer to the press release for a full list of updated metrics. For the full year, we now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 4% to 4.5%. We now anticipate LIFO will be a $200 million charge to operating income versus the $500 million charge that was in our prior guide. We expect operating income in constant currency to increase approximately 7% to 7.5%. This now assumes a 30 basis point year-over-year tailwind from LIFO compared to our prior guidance, which assumed a 100 basis point headwind. And we estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.36 to $6.46, including an expected $0.05 impact from LIFO. To bridge to our prior guide, we flowed through the Q2 beat, removed the Walmart U.S. LIFO charges that were previously expected in Q3 and Q4 and modestly raised our sales expectations. Looking at Q3, we're now offering the following view. We expect net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 3%. Operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 1%. This year-over-year growth is impacted by several comparison factors. We expect ongoing mix pressure impacts to gross margin to continue in Q3. We also expect a negative impact from fuel margins at Sam's Club versus last year's elevated levels. And similar to Q2, variable pay expense is expected to be higher in Q3 versus last year when we were below our planned performance. We don't typically guide currency, but it's worth noting that if rates stayed where they are currently, we'd see a $1.6 billion benefit to Q3 reported sales and reported operating income growth would be closer to 3.5%. And lastly, we expect Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.45 to $1.50. In closing, we're pleased with the strong first half of the year, and we positioned the business favorably for the back half. Our financial performance is validating our omnichannel strategy, driving organic sales growth while improving margins and returns. We're optimistic about our ability to improve our performance even more in the future. We like our position. And now I'll hand it back to [Doug] for a few comments before the operator opens the line for questions. Doug McMillon : Thank you, John, David. Before we take your questions, I want to say a few words about the leadership changes we shared yesterday. Let's start by celebrating Judith. She has done a fantastic job in many roles over the 27 years she's been part of our company. She leaves her most recent role having delivered strong results and having transformed the business. It's a different portfolio, better positioned for the future, it's better positioned for growth on the top and bottom line. She strengthened our culture and sets us up for a digital future at the same time. We're grateful. We talked about Kath moving into the international leadership role. The results Kath and our team have delivered at Sam's speak for themselves. Her experience and passion to serve customers and members will take us to the next level. It will be fun to watch her impact around the world. Some of you met Chris Nicholas and know how capable he is. He joined us five years ago in a finance role but with previous experience in merchandising and operations in several markets around the world. He'll keep our member obsession going in Sam's Club U.S. and pick right off where Kath left off. We also shared yesterday that Kieran Shanahan will join John's team and become our Walmart U.S. Chief Operating Officer. Kieran has 25 years with our company working in a wide variety of roles in all three segments. He is well prepared to lead this big team and the change that's coming through our automation investments in the supply chain. As they build these new roles, John, Kath, Chris and Kieran will have all four worked in all three operating segments of our business. There's not only a lot of store and club expertise in this group, but there's also a great deal of digital and e-commerce experience. These are omnichannel merchants that are purpose-driven proven leadership skills. The depth of leadership in our company is such an advantage, but times get passed and we keep running, keep changing and keep pushing things forward. I want to say congratulations to all of them. And now I'll turn it back over to the operator. We're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Robbie Ohmes : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, you mentioned that you're seeing things in general merchandise, I think that make you more optimistic about the back half. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing? I think John David said something about disciplined buying in general merchandise, what are you seeing that's making you optimistic? And how should we think about general merchandise? And maybe if you could also weave in there. I know that you guys have continued to mention the high income customer shopping. I think it's been more grocery focused. Have you seen high-income customers broadening out into the rest of the store? Doug McMillon : Robbie, this is Doug. I'll go first and then John or others can add if they want to. What's making a little bit better as the run rate compared to the previous quarter and how back-to-school started? And typically, when back-to-school is strong, it bodes well for what happens with Halloween and Christmas and GM in the back half. I do think our food and consumables percent to total in Walmart U.S. will still go up. Part of it is what's happened with inflation and disinflation in the GM categories. But relative to what I would have thought 90 days ago or when we started the year, GM is holding up better than I would have guessed. And I just - I feel like that with our store managers and the merchants, we want to have an optimistic posture on GM as we go into the back half. Anybody want to add anything? John Furner : Doug, I'd like to - I give credit to the team for improvements we made. If you think about where we were last year with inventory headwinds for this year. I was in stores this week, and it's really clear that stores have the ability, and our merchandising their store with discretion appropriately. They're on top of their markdowns. Back rooms are in much better shape. The second thing, I think that's helping is the e-commerce team, has done a nice job launching new products, things like registry for teachers in classrooms and parents and lists. Those are all working and helping back-to-school. And then the last thing that I'd say is the team is doing a really nice job with seasonal events and holidays. One of the things that we hear consistently from customers right now as they're looking forward to celebrating again, like they used to. That's a bit of a theme that's coming through, and we certainly saw that from Memorial Day, July 4, back-to-school started strong. So, we look forward to the holiday. It's going to be a big holiday season. There are a lot of dynamics, as John David and Doug said in the market. But we want - to remain very flexible and prepared to help people get together, and celebrate each of these holidays that in front of us. John David Rainey : There are also categories of general merchandise that on our marketplace saw double-digit increases, things like home, apparel, hardlines, which really gives you an indication of how our business, is changing as we're selling more third-party assortment. John Furner : It is. And John David, I think our event, our plus event you mentioned in your remarks as well was a good example. We had a high level of participation from marketplace sellers. We've talked about the number of items available in the sites, up almost four extra a year ago. Our seller count has grown. The number of customers are growing. And Tom and the team have done a nice job building capabilities that will really help us in the future. John David Rainey : On the second part of your question, Robbie, with respect to high-income consumers, we continue to see share gains across all income demographics. I think encouragingly for us in the quarter, the number of categories that we saw share gain and actually expand it. But this has been pretty consistent for five or six quarters now. And it really points to the fact that our value proposition is resonating with customers. It's not just about everyday low prices. It's also about convenience and convenience matters to every household income demographic. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Katharine McShane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. With gross margin expanding about 50 basis points in the quarter, is there a way to quantify the buckets of contribution between the higher-margin businesses like marketplace, and advertising, and the impact mix that's coming from the stronger grocery? And just given the more optimistic general merchandise commentary, is there any update to your mix assumptions in guidance for the second half when it comes to gross margins? Thank you. John David Rainey : The biggest contributors to the gross margin expansion were really just the lapping of some of the markdowns that we had last year. I would point you to that as the single biggest contributor. But that's not to take away from some of the progress, that we're seeing in terms of diversifying or expanding these other higher-margin initiatives, and advertising is one I mentioned in my prepared remarks, up 35% for the quarter. But equally as impressive or perhaps more impressive is the advertiser count was actually up 60% year-over-year in the quarter. And it stands to reason, if we're gaining share and customers are shopping with us then advertisers are going to want to spend their money where the eyeballs are. So, we're encouraged about this, and it really illustrates the sort of this flywheel element of our business is we get stronger in marketplace, and some of these other initiatives that enables us to go out, and be better in advertising, and other things that tend to have a higher margin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen : Hi everybody and Judith, congrats as well. The guidance could be conservative based on the great quarter you just had. How are you thinking about what's incorporated in ticket and traffic for next quarter? And also as we look forward to holiday, what are some highlights of how you're planning inventory price point assortment, in practical, can often correlate to holiday. So that's very encouraging that you're seeing good performance there. And just a follow-up. You've done a great job with computer vision and your own networks, especially with inventory management. You called out generative AI and LLM. What are your thoughts about how that may intersect the Walmart+ and all the data you have on being a tech-enabled in terms of context and customer interaction? Thank you. Doug McMillon : I'll take the last one first. This is Doug, Oliver. Thanks for the question. I'm really excited about what's possible. And we've been working for a few years now to try, and get our data in better shape so that we can really put it to work. We still got room to improve there, but we have made progress. And when you start imagining what we can do to personalize for customers, and members more effectively while still living in an EDLP world and driving the business model that way, because that's the winning strategy for us. There's a great opportunity for us to be more anticipatory, and to be more relevant to them, and communicate in a way that shows that we know who they are in a healthy way, while protecting privacy. So having that data, go to work with our own large language models, and using large language models from others, presents a tremendous opportunity. And I think it will unlock a lot of use cases on the customer member side. As I mentioned in the prerecorded remarks, the opportunity with associates is also terrific. The supply chain is the third area that comes to mind. So, I think, this will be an opportunity for us for a really long time to try, and grow top line and be more efficient as a company by putting that technology to work. John David Rainey : I'll take the first part of your question on guidance and maybe start on holiday, before I turn to the segment CEOs. But on our assumptions on ticket and traffic, well, we saw a pretty equal balance between those in the second quarter, both were up, call it, roughly 3%. It would stand the reason that as we get into the back half of the year, and we lap some of these - some of the higher inflation from last year, that ticket in terms of balance between those two. We may see a little less in ticket. But we're really encouraged by, as we noted, the strength in units that we had in the quarter. So pleased about that. And again, we're gaining share here. So, I think our value proposition is resonating. With respect to the holiday, I'll just say one comment, maybe turn it to John. Consumers are not compromising on some of the holiday seasons. They're being choiceful in their spending, discerning. But around July 4 and some of the other holidays that we've seen, they're showing a willingness to spend. And we're - our team is leaning into that, providing merchandise that they want to buy. John Furner : They are - John David. And we've talked about this for a while that the flexibility in terms of what we offer is meaningful for customers. And the transaction growth. We're proud of the team. We saw that in eCommerce. We mentioned marketplace. Pickup and delivery have been strong. In-store traffic and transaction count has also been strong. So having an offering that's there for the customer. However, they want to shop, whenever they want to shop is helping us. And having as many locations as we do certainly is an important part of the equation when it comes to delivering. The last thing I would say is, is in general merchandise, and other categories where we have seen a number of rollbacks this year that are quite intentional. The results are really strong, whether it's the Justice 17-ish backpack or the Frito-Lay multi-pack from general merchandise to food, we are seeing rollbacks work across the business and customers are responding. They're choiceful. They're being thoughtful about what they buy, and our merchants have done a nice job of leaning in seasonally to ensure that our rollbacks are in the right places for the customer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to go to the international business in China specifically. I was hoping to get more color in terms of what you're seeing in the market. Now for the second consecutive quarter in a row, your results seem to stand out versus some of the weaker macro data points that we're seeing out there in China. Judith McKenna : Hi. Yes. Thank you. I mean, the quarter was strong for international overall. And as you heard both John David and Doug mentioned, China was one of the stronger markets that we had along with Walmex, which had a 10% growth. And both of our businesses in India, Flipkart and PhonePe, both had strong quarters as well. A lot of that is driven from just really being close to the customer in those markets and the combination of value and convenience that we're now able to offer. Turning to China specifically, I actually got back to China this quarter for the first time in 3.5 years. What really struck me when I was there was the speed with which the consumer has moved. So, the move to online and digital penetration has been extraordinary in our business. It ranges in the mid-40% that we're seeing. And we have two formats there. We have the Sam's Club format and we have the hypermarket format. And what's interesting is both formats have got positive traffic and both are gaining market share. And I think the reason for that is that back to this combination of value and quality and trust that we're able to provide. Sam's Club, in particular, had a really strong quarter again, and we opened a couple of new clubs. We now have 45 clubs across China, and they're really combining great items at great value. And they're seeing an interesting trend in higher penetration of very high-ticket items in China too. In the hypers, I got a chance to visit some of our re-modeled new version hypermarkets. You've heard me talk a couple of times about the transformation in hypers that's ongoing, and I was really impressed with the thoughtful way in which the teams there have reduced assortment, brightened and freshened stores, increased signage, helps customers navigate not only through great fresh departments, but also made the general merchandise shopping much simpler. So, I think you have two formats there, both of which are leading in the segments in which they operate and that's helping us win customers. And our associates, I will just say there are doing a fantastic job, and it was just great to see them after such a long time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez : Hi, thanks, guys. Curious within food and grocery, how you would characterize the current landscape from a promotional perspective relative to last year in history? And how are you thinking about price investment as a tool to gain further market share, just given the changes in inflation expectations? Thanks. John Furner : Compared to a year ago, Paul, certainly, inflation is at a lower rate than what it was. It's been relatively stubborn in dry grocery more than other places over the course of the year. Price gaps are something that we spend a lot of time on each and every week. We start Monday talking about trading and what's happening in the market, price is always one of the major topics. We would assure that our value are right, and we are pleased with where the value is today. The grocery business is gaining share. Certainly, we're going to watch the market. As I said a moment ago, we do have a number of rollbacks that are effective in food. Our rollback count in food is higher than last year. It is lower in general merchandise than a year ago, but a reminder that last year we were clearing a lot of inventory that had been backlog, so the general merchandise rollbacks which are very effective are more choiceful, and I think reflective of the seasons that people are in. So, our job from here is to ensure that we're ready for people that are getting back to school all across the country in the next couple of weeks, colleges, we have tailgating season coming up Labor Day, and we're right into the holiday food season. I'd say, too, I felt promotions is the easy solution to inflation versus doing the hard work of working with your suppliers to walk back all the commodity and cost increases that kind of have been absorbed over the last 2 years. So there's a lot of work in just tracking the cost of transportation. And then as that's come down, working back with each supplier to have a look at what proportion of the cost is impacted by that and how do you roll that back. So I know in Sam's, the team have a great big board. They ring a cowbell every time we get a cost decrease. And you flow it on to the member. And I think that's how we want to think about it versus thinking about how do we go out and do promotions. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. Judith, congratulations, and to every promotion, congratulations. My question is more medium term. I wanted to ask about the inflection on EBIT dollar growth. At Shareholders', we talked about how in fiscal '25, it should or could get better than where we are today, realizing we're lapping some easy compares from last year right now. Can we hone in on what needs to take place for this EBIT dollar growth inflection? Assuming healthy sales, leverage over fixed cost, Marketplace ramping, is it advertising? Can you talk about sort of what's in your control and what's more sales-driven as we think about EBIT growth going forward? John David Rainey : Sure, Simeon. I'll start with maybe a bit of a victory lap here. Because the first half of the year has actually been pretty good in terms of the relationship of operating income and sales. We've grown the top line at, call it, 6% and operating income at almost twice that. And that's much better than what we've done historically. So we're very encouraged internally that we're executing so well right out of the gate after sharing our goals at our Investor Community Meeting in April. As we get into next year, really what you're going to see is more of a continuation of the strategy that we laid out is we further diversified our earnings streams. A lot of these areas, like advertising and data ventures, these higher-margin businesses are growing at a rate much, much faster than the rest of our business. And so as you look at the math around that, our margins just want to go up. The other thing is, as you're well aware of, Simeon, are the efficiencies that come from our supply chain. And so today, we have roughly 15% of our stores that are served by automated regional distribution centers. And when you think about something like an e-commerce FC, that gives us efficiencies of upwards of 30% on things like units per hour. And so as we continue to roll out this automation to the rest of our network, we're going to see the benefits of that in our P&L. You're seeing it right now. And it gives us conviction and optimism as we look out over the next several years to be able to grow operating income at a rate that is faster than sales and perhaps appreciably faster than sales. Doug McMillon : Simeon, this is Doug. I'll just add on. I think John David said it well, the two threads, the two questions are how is the automation work going? And how is that playing through as it relates to productivity? And that's a multiyear implementation of these various forms of automated storage and retrieval systems that we've talked to you about. And then the second one is how is the business model changing? And the engine for that is what's the digital percent of total, how is e-commerce growing and what's the pull-through to advertising and the other components that shape that business model. And the reason I'm repeating it is because I wanted to make the point that it's not just the Walmart U.S. business that's going through that transformation. As I've been traveling in International in the last few weeks, the commonality from Canada to Chile, and Judith had that team from Mexico in town this week, what Gui and the team are doing there, it's very consistent as it relates to how omnichannel retail is coming to life across our company. So I think those are the two threads to keep your eye on. John David Rainey : You didn't frame the question, Simeon, in terms of return on investment. But I want to take an opportunity to talk about that. When we get to the end of this year and you look at our ROI on a trailing 12-month basis, we're going to see fairly material uptick if you look at our guidance, what's implied there. And that's more than what we expected at the beginning of the year. We actually anticipated that some of the improvements in ROI would be - would come next year and some of the years thereafter. We are actually pulling forward some of those benefits that we expected next year. And so we're going to see some of that this year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Good morning, thanks for taking our questions and congrats on your retirement as well, Judith. Wanted to just ask about e-commerce growth, 24%, I think, implies some pretty big market share gains but led by pickup and delivery. And I was curious if you could also just give us a sense of how Marketplace and 3P is ramping relative to your expectations and how, if at all, that's impacting the general merchandise comp. And related to that, I guess, as you think of long term about the profitability of advertising, is there a similar opportunity on the food and consumables side? Or is it better to have discretionary and 3P a greater mix of e-commerce as it relates to growing advertising profitability? Doug McMillon : Hi, Kelly, thanks for the question. One, really happy with the performance. And the team deserves credit for a lot of improvements that enabled the 24% growth. When we talk about pickup and delivery specifically, I think I would take a step back and just remind everyone what we talked about at our investor conference and what we're ultimately trying to do with supply chain in the entire e-commerce business, is densify our inventory at the first mile, make the middle mile as efficient as possible and then shorten the last mile. And our store locations, over 4,700 locations in addition to the fulfillment centers, enable us to do that. So what's happened over the last year or so is more of our e-commerce business and deliveries have come from stores because that's where the inventory is closest to the customer and helps us with efficiency. So it's important to frame that, that is a part of the total. The way we measure this internally as we look at the number of transactions and customers and what they bought in the store, what they picked up and what was delivered. The second part of your question, really pleased with the progress in Marketplace. Our Plus event was a good marker for us in terms of what's possible. With the Marketplace, a majority of our revenue from that event was driven by Marketplace sellers. And I'm thankful to the sellers who participated and helped us find customers or helped our customers find value at a time when they're looking for value. And that was across all categories, including general merchandise. In fact, much of the event was general merchandise. So I think the team has positioned the Marketplace well. And in terms of the second part of your question with advertising, there are opportunities for sellers. There are opportunities for suppliers. We'll continue to learn, grow and experiment in stores and on the site. We want to ensure that Walmart Connect, the name Walmart Connect, connects our buyers, suppliers and sellers all to our customers in a way that's accretive to the customer experience. We want to make sure that customers are finding what they want when they want it. And if this business can help people connect together, that's great. And we saw that happen in the quarter. And the growth was higher than our e-commerce growth. Judith McKenna : If we're talking about e-commerce and Marketplace, it would be particularly be remiss of me not to talk about Flipkart and the growth that we've seen there. We were there as well recently. And that business is just continuing to go from strength-to-strength. It's consistently performed in line with our expectations over the last few years. I'm really pleased to see the positive contribution margins continue and then their business mix is really quite healthy. So seeing strength in hardlines, particularly across mobile and electronics as well. The scaling of their ecosystem is also helping contribute not only to the overall business, but also to their advertising revenues well. So interesting, coming back to this theme of quality and convenience to people, they recently launched in their Cleartrip business, luxury packages of holidays in India, which are going incredibly well as well. Myntra, which is the largest fashion online retailer in India as John David mentioned as well, they've just launched a MyFashionGPT capability as well, which is quite incredible. And I used it this morning. I put in, what to wear to go to the airport? And they gave me, to England, to the airport. And they gave me, Black T-shirt, black leggings, a jacket and sunglasses, which I think was rather optimistic using the sunglasses for England. But it shows you the power of what I think gen AIs can do in the future. And it's really coming to life in India. It's just a great business, and be proud to be able to be associated with it for the last five years. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question Edward Yruma : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You guys have done a lot to enhance the accessibility at Walmart+. You've added a ton of new features. I guess, as you sit back and assess the success of the program, kind of what's turned the dial the most? And then in terms of the data you're able to now collect, where have you been able to kind of pivot and change the flow of business based on some of the stuff that you're collecting from these Walmart+ customers? Thanks. Doug McMillon : Hi, Edward. Certainly, we want to have a digital relationship with as many customers as possible, pleased with the growth overall. And as we've talked about before, Plus is an important part of the offer we have. I would pull the reason back that Plus has had more success to the very core of the offer. The offer was established to limit the number of deliveries people get without having a charge on those deliveries from both the fulfillment centers and the stores. We launched this in 2020, certainly had issues at that point with availability. And we've had inventory imbalances. But in the last year or so, the focus continues to be and improvements have been in the core, where we measure every week something we call perfect order. The stores are very focused on what we call the first-time pick rate, which is picking the order the first time they look for it. And then another thing that we do very intentionally is measure what percent of the order was delivered before there were any substitution. So what customers are looking for is exactly what they ordered at the time that they expected it to be delivered. And that's the way we hold ourselves accountable. Certainly, the other benefits are helpful. There are different features that people are using. And it is important to have a variety of benefits. But the core of the offer is the most important thing that we have to execute going forward. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Seth Sigman : Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up on the value proposition that Walmart offers today. So private label seems to have a lot of momentum and is likely one of the factors that's helping drive market share here. How are you managing private label differently than in the past? And how do you think that plays into the competitive gap here more from a basket-level perspective? And then ultimately, do you think that this advantage is sustainable even in an environment where maybe inflation moderates or prices decline? Love some perspective on that. Thank you. Doug McMillon : It's important for us to have a wide range of assortment for a broad section of customers, where all over the country, situations are different for different customers. And whatever the situation is for any particular customer, then that's what we want to be there for. We've talked about this before. We don't set targets or percentages of the business that we expect private label to grow to or be a part of. It's important that we have values on brands, on branded items. It's important that we have values and quality across the portfolio in e-commerce and stores. And in the last few quarters, customers have chosen the private brands at Walmart at an accelerated pace. I think there are a lot of reasons for that. But if our quality and price were in the position that it needs to be, then they wouldn't repeat. So we'll continue to stay focused on quality and value there. Kathryn McLay : Yes. And I think from a Member's Mark perspective, we have seen our metrics around value for money and NPS and quality, our Member's Mark has continued to improve. And we're seeing members choose it because of the quality of the item, because of innovation into those products and also because the great value that they get out of the Member's Mark, price/quality combination. Doug McMillon : We're seeing leverage across markets with private brands, too, whether it's Great Value or Member's Mark. Judith McKenna : Yes, Member's Market, of course, is available in our Sam's Clubs globally, around the world but also many other items as well. And I know you were in Chile recently, Doug, and they have a phenomenal international foods aisle, which is showing incredible growth, many of which are private brands, which are imported from around the world, from the rest of the Walmart world. Doug McMillon : When I was in Canada, they made me Great Value tomato ketchup potato chips. I'm out on that. But that's not - I'm sure Canadians love it, but that's one private brand item that I'm not a fan of. John David Rainey : You made some of us eat that. Doug McMillon : John David liked him better than I did. Operator : The next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed your question. Corey Tarlowe : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if we could just take a step back and assess the health of the overall customer maybe in the U.S. and also perhaps internationally versus the first quarter and into the second quarter? And how you're thinking about the general health of the customer throughout the remainder of this year? And then just secondarily, on shrink, what are you seeing as it relates to shrink? And what are you expecting ahead as we think about that particular dynamic? Doug McMillon : From an enterprise point of view, just on the customer and member first, and others can chime in on that, I feel like that our position is one where if things do get tougher, they're going to increasingly look for value and we're going to be able to grow the top line. Hopefully, things do get better. And there are a lot of conflicting data points, but you guys see the same data that we do. There are reasons to be optimistic in areas like employment and the wage inflation that's happened. And there are other reasons to be concerned - as consumer balance sheets potentially weaken over time. But again, we like our position. We like it in terms of the breadth of product categories we can sell whatever people want to buy. We like it in terms of the way we can serve people, whether its curbside or its delivery or it's in a store club. So our job is to grow our share to win through the customer value prop, which is price, assortment, experience and trust. And whether that's in Mexico or the United States, that's the position that we put ourselves in, and we just need to execute against that. On shrink, John, you can comment too, but I'd just remind everybody, from a total enterprise point of view, we're more than a domestic retailer. And we've got 19 countries. We've got Sam's Club. We've got a variety of businesses. And so, it's not necessarily the same answer as maybe some of the others that are in the news of our shrink. John David Rainey : And Doug, I'd add that, of course, shrink is an important part of margin, but there are many parts of margin that are important to be able to deliver for customers. And the first is, we want to make sure that we're pricing as low as possible. So customers find the greatest value that they can possibly find. Shrink has increased a bit this year. It increased last year. It's uneven across the country. It's not in every market. Some markets are higher than others. But we do have the tailwinds that we mentioned earlier, which are cost of supply chain and markdowns from last year. So lot components go into this. We'll keep watching it. We don't want it to go up, obviously, because it could cause prices to rise, and we've heard that across the market, but it is a part of what we're managing and the team is doing a nice job with value, and the team is doing a nice job managing the margin in total. Doug McMillon : Shrink is comprised of more than one thing. That's part of it. And we do think that in some jurisdictions here in the U.S., there needs to be action taken to help protect people from crime, including theft. The other part of Shrink is more controllable, and we stay focused on that as a priority. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Krisztina Katai : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. And I'll add my congratulations to Judith as well. I have a question on Sam's Club. I think I heard you say in the single-digit member growth within the quarter. So can you talk about your membership gains and the momentum that you have been seeing in the business as well as the renewal rate? And how you think about membership value for the consumer in the face of moderating food inflation? And then secondly, if I could just ask on the private label penetration that is still increasing. Just how are you generally anticipating volumes to play out in the back half of the year between your private brands versus your national brands as rollbacks are increasing? Thank you. Kathryn McLay : If I start - is just talking about the member health. We've seen historic growth in our membership base over the last few years, and we continue to see growth in absolute member numbers. Our tenured renewal rate held, so it did an increase or decrease it held from quarter-to-quarter. And we are continuing to look at different ways to introduce people to the value of our Sam's Club membership. And so, you've seen us over the years, try a couple of different things. On our 40th year birthday, we had a great price for new members. Really, that's just an opportunity to invite people in, to experience for themselves the value of membership looks like, and then we want to turn them into a tenured renewal member going forward. So, we feel strong about the health of our membership and the growth that we've seen. John Furner : And Walmart - on our membership, consistent growth last few quarters, but we really did have a successful plus event, really good results all across the business. As I said earlier, the core of the offer is the most important thing that we deliver, and that includes perfect order or fill rates and availability. Customers trust us to be able to deliver their food, consumables and general merchandise items consistently and on time. On the question on private brand volume, I would also just repeat consistency over the last couple of quarters, and we've talked about growth of private brands really since the beginning of 2022. Again, we don't have targets on that. We want to be there for customers regardless of what they choose, whether it's a branded item or a private brand item on private brands. We stay focused on quality and value. And in some cases, like if you're in a store today, you would see a rollback on great value mustard, and it's working really well. It's a staple that has seen really great growth, because of values that we offer. So getting prices back down, and dry grocery is important for the consumer, and we want to be able to help them, and lead that in any way that we can. John David Rainey : If I can just say one other thing on private brand. We discussed that because I think it gives a good indication on how the consumer is being pressured right now, but that is not a driver of our margin performance. While the overall margin on private brand may be a little bit higher, the dollar profit is about the same. And if you look at the shift in composition year-over-year, we're only talking 40 basis points. So this is not a driver of our financial results. So, if we see a reversion there, it's not going to have any outsized impact on our business. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking our question. Doug, is it fair to think that Walmart has more visibility into its gross margin rate heading into next year than it has in recent memory, given the inflection in the profitability of the eCommerce business, the contribution from alternative profits, presumably less of a drag from GLP-1 drugs and the prospect that general merchandise is better. And if that is fair, do you take this as an opportunity to double down and accelerate some of the investments that clearly have been working and translating to share gain? Thank you. Doug McMillon : Hi, Michael. Thanks for the question. We didn't see COVID coming, and we didn't anticipate inflation to be as high as it - has been in the United States. So, if you could tell me what we're not anticipating right now, I might be able to answer your question about next year, I think your underlying premise that we kind of know what the shape is, and we're not in this position that we were 12 months ago with inventory has got some truth to it. As it relates to doubling down, I think we are being aggressive. We are currently going through our long-range planning cycle. And as we look at our opportunities to invest next year and over the next five years, we look at that board, and we get excited about it. John David made the point in a meeting earlier this week. It isn't it cool to be a part of a company that started in 1962 that sees opportunities to drive strong returns. With today's investments to help you contemporize the business for the future, and I agree with that. Like it's a really cool spot to be in. To have cash flow to have this strong business and to have opportunities in front of us that transform the business, and create another level of operational excellence through productivity, for example. So I think we've got an aggressive plan. We talked at the investor conference about our capital plan. And we continue to see opportunities to invest to grow top, and bottom line. We expect ROI to go up over time. It may not happen that every quarter, operating income grows faster than sales. But over time, as we said at the investor conference, we expect that to be the case, because of productivity in the business model shape. So, I'll just repeat what we said there. I think we're being appropriately aggressive given the environment. And I'm excited about that. John David Rainey : Yes. I would just add, Michael, just like you view a portfolio of stocks, you diversify, because it reduces the risk. I think in some ways, we're doing the same thing with our business. We're not solely dependent upon just what's happening with brick-and-mortar retail. Like we've got other income streams that, by definition, sort of the diversification of that, reduces our dependency on any one thing, and also reduces the risk around that, too. So, we feel pretty good about our outlook. Doug McMillon : Just maybe one more comment on strategy. As we go through this year's cycle, and I think this was true to a large degree last year, I mean it's pretty common, but we know what the components are. And it's a challenge to execute across multiple fronts. And it's full-time work to run great stores and clubs. It's also a full-time work to grow an excellent eCommerce business, and there are lots of components to that, and it's got to happen around the world. But we've got the resources. And importantly, we've got the talent to do it. And so, I think the shape of that board kind of the where-to-play aspect of our strategy looks pretty consistent, and that builds confidence. We just - we're in execution mode, and we like the plan that's right in front of us. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : Before I wrap things up, I just want to acknowledge the tragedy that happened in Hawaii in Maui. The company has stepped forward with financial support for the United Way and Red Cross, as you would expect, we're providing essentials providing supplies. We're flying merchandise there. We're bulking up on what people need. And our team on the ground has done a fantastic job. Our store manager there is Chris Pierce. And Chris and his team have supported the community there, as you would expect them to, and we're really proud of them. That was a terrible tragedy. I mean as we wrap up, I'll thank you for your focus on our business. As I mentioned just a second ago, we are really excited about what's in front of us. I think you know what the plan is. We're positioned to grow the top line. Over time, we can grow profit faster than sales through productivity, and shaping the business model differently, which will result in higher levels of return on investment, and we're excited about delivering that. And I'm grateful to what everyone did for this quarter. And I want to thank Judith for what she's contributed to this company. It's been really significant, and we're going to miss her. Thankful, she's sticking around for a little while to help with some things, and I'm excited for Kath and Chris and Karen. Walmart's got a deep bench, and we'll keep going. Thank you all for your time. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, over to you. Doug McMillon : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to talk about our third quarter results and how we're seeing the rest of the year. Our value proposition continues to resonate with customers, helping us gain share and drive e-commerce growth. We're on track to grow adjusted operating income at a faster rate than sales for the year, consistent with what we discussed at our investor meeting earlier this year. We had strong revenue growth for the quarter across each of our segments. Comp sales for Walmart U.S. were 4.9% and 3.8% for Sam's Club U.S. Sales for Walmart International were up 5.4% in constant currency, led by Walmex and China. Sam's Club continues to perform well both in Mexico and China, and while strength was broad-based for Walmex. Our Bodega Aurrera business is worth calling out as it continues to deliver outstanding growth. E-commerce sales were up 24% in Walmart U.S., 16% in Sam's Club U.S., and 15% globally. Timing of our Flipkart Big Billion Days event, which moved from Q3 last year to Q4 this year, affected comparisons in our International segment, leading to a decline of 3%. So we'll see the benefit from the timing shift as we report next quarter. Across markets, the team did a nice job driving our seasonal events. Our in-stock and inventory levels are in good shape. We finished down 1.2% in inventory for the total company, including down 5% for Walmart U.S. Both our top line and adjusted EPS came in better than what we projected at the beginning of the quarter, but we could have done a better job on expenses, which is reflected in adjusted operating income growing less than we expected. We had a couple of unexpected expense increases in SG&A, and you'll hear more about those when John David walks through the numbers. In the U.S., pricing levels in many food categories continue to be a concern. Overall, our product costs are up versus last year, and they remain up even more on a two-year stack, which is putting pressure on our customers. Beef prices are high, but we're happy to see lower pricing in dairy, on eggs, and with chicken and seafood. The pockets of disinflation we are seeing are helping, but we'd like to see more, faster, especially in the dry grocery and consumables categories. The other good news is that general merchandise prices continue to come down GM is down low to mid-single digits versus last year. That enables us to rollback pricing which will help our customers during this holiday season when general merchandise is so important for gift-giving. We still see pressure from mix including outside the U.S., which we expected, but I like the market-share gains we're seeing in this category. In the U.S., we may be managing through a period of deflation in the months to come. And while that would put more unit pressure on us, we welcome it because it's better for our customers. When I look at our P&L, it's continuing to change shape. Mentally, break it down as a combination of a traditional retail P&L and a newer version that starts with our digital businesses. It flows from first and third-party e-commerce pickup and delivery to businesses like membership, advertising and fulfillment as a service. It includes some faster growing, higher margin components that combined with the more traditional P&L gives us a business model that's more profitable in percentage terms as it grows. We saw strong growth in all these areas for the quarter. And when you put it together with the supply-chain automation work we're doing, you get a more sustainable business that can grow more effectively over time and create a better mix along the way. Marketplace is one of our engines for these mutually reinforcing businesses. Meaning that marketplace growth pulls other businesses like fulfillment through. Back in September, we held our first ever Marketplace Seller Summit. We hosted thousands of current and potential sellers to let them see first-hand our commitment to this business and how we will grow it together. Since the beginning of last year, we've more than doubled the number of items available to customers on our U.S. marketplace. It's an important piece of what we're building, and it's growing fast and not just in the U.S. We have a unique opportunity to grow in India, Mexico, Canada, and Chile. We love the opportunity to grow our assortment in this way, so customers can get what they want, when and how they want it. We're making shopping easier and more convenient. Our net promoter scores for pickup and delivery in Walmart U.S. are improving and we've started using generative AI to improve our search and chat experience. We've released an improved beta version of search to some of our customers who are using our app on iOS. In the coming weeks and months, we will enhance this experience and roll it out to more customers. When I step back and look at the company overall, I love what we're building and how we're building it. We've got a good hand at play and a strong team making things happen. It's our recipe for growth and improved margin and returns we've been discussing with you. Everyday low prices are a foundational component of us fulfilling our purpose. We bring EDLP to life on a year-round basis by doing things like offering a Thanksgiving meal in the U.S. and Canada, that cost less than last year. We're offering tremendous value for things like fashion, electronics, and seasonal decorations and helping remind people that when they're looking to buy toys, we're the place to come because we have the right product at the right price. The same focus on purpose and execution came through when I was visiting Chile, Canada, and China earlier this quarter, it was my first time back in China since before the pandemic. Our team there run some of the most incredible Sam's Clubs in the world and they continue to be a leader for us in terms of digital penetration and innovation. As I wrap up, I know we're all concerned about events across the world, war, acts of terror, political unrest, impacts from storms like those in Mexico from Hurricane Otis, the pressure we're feeling from stubborn inflation in some categories and other challenges beyond our control. As for our company, we care about everyone. We want to be a place where literally everyone feels comfortable and welcomed to shop or work. We want to live our values and create a warm, safe and fun place for the hundreds of millions of people that will shop with us in the days and weeks ahead. I'm grateful to be part of this big team, grateful to work alongside our associates. Now, I'll turn it over to John David. John David Rainey : I'd like to start by thanking our customers, members, associates and partners for helping us deliver a good quarter. We're pleased overall with how the team executed and how our strong value proposition and omnichannel strategy continue to resonate with customers. We're gaining share, seeing strong e-commerce growth, and excited about the contributions from higher margin businesses like advertising. Sales grew more than 4%, gross profit was better than expected and we exceeded our guidance for EPS. These results reinforce the benefits of our highly diversified business with broad-based contributions across segments and markets, channels and formats, and strategic growth areas. While we're pleased with our topline results, operating income was below our guidance due to higher than anticipated expenses largely certain legal accruals. I'll provide more details on guidance shortly. But the key takeaway is that we're raising our full year sales and EPS guide while reiterating our prior operating income guidance. We expect the relationship between profit and sales growth to favor profitability in Q4 and for the full year to align with our goal of operating income growing faster than sales. Now let me review the key financial highlights for Q3, using our financial framework of growth, margins and returns. First, growth. Constant currency sales increased 4.4% or nearly $7 billion. Importantly, we saw traffic growth across both in-store and digital channels. All three operating segments experienced mid-single digit sales growth, with comp sales for Walmart U.S. up 4.9%, in Sam's Club U.S. up 3.8% excluding fuel. International grew sales 5.4% in constant currency with Walmex sales up more than 9%, and China up 25% with strong performance in Sam's Club and e-commerce. The timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days pressured international sales growth as the event moved from Q3 last year to Q4 this year. So we expect the timing to be a benefit to Q4's growth rate for the segment. PhonePe also continued its strong momentum with annualized TPV or total payment volume reaching 1.2 trillion on nearly 5.8 billion monthly transactions. And PhonePe recently achieved an impressive milestone eclipsing 500 million registered users. We continue to grow share in key categories, particularly in Walmart U.S. grocery where we delivered positive comps and saw strong share gains in both units and dollars. Grocery inflation moderated nearly 300 basis points from Q2 levels to a mid-single digit increase versus last year. But on a two-year stack, it was still elevated at a high teens percentage. We see our customers showing ongoing discretion in seeking value to manage within their household budget, while general merchandise sales were down low-single digits year-over-year in Q3, the rate of change was stable to Q2 levels and we gained share across categories. As we enter the holiday season, we're working hard to lower grocery prices to ease the pressure for customers giving them more capacity for general merchandise spent. Our business is rooted in a timeless purpose to save customer's money, so they can live better. Against any economic backdrop, we're there for customers, how and where they need us and we're making shopping with Walmart and Sam's Club, more convenient. Omni services including pickup and store fulfilled delivery continue to drive strong growth, leading to a 24% increase in Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales and 16% growth at Sam's Club. Multi-channel shoppers are more valuable, engaging more often and spending more with us. Pickup and delivery for Walmart U.S. has been a key source of growth and share gains among upper income households and has become the most productive channel for acquiring Walmart Plus members. In International, Walmex's expansion of omni offerings led to 1.5 million Bodega store-fulfilled digital orders in Q3. In Canada, we continue to roll out our unlimited next day store delivery subscription called Delivery Pass, which is now available from two-thirds of our Canada stores. And I was in China recently where our business is nearly a 50-50 split of physical and digital. I was impressed with how we're serving omni customers with speed and accuracy through new engagement and delivery models. Turning to margins. Gross margins expanded 32 basis points, reflecting the timing shift of Big Billion Days in India and lapping last year's LIFO charge at Sam's Club U.S. Walmart U.S. gross margins increased to 5 basis points reflecting lower markdowns and supply chain costs. But we're still seeing an ongoing category mix pressure as health and wellness and grocery sales outperformed general merchandise. Continued disinflation along with the success of our merchants at Sam's Club and bringing down the cost of inventory resulted in us not taking the expected $50 million LIFO charge in Q3. We no longer expect any further LIFO charges in Sam's Club this year. As we've said previously, over the next several years, we expect margins to move higher as we modernize our supply chain and scale higher margin growth initiatives. We made good progress on both during the quarter. We continue to deploy capital to build technologies and optimize our next-generation supply chain with automation and productivity benefits starting to appear in our results. We now operate nine regional distribution centers servicing U.S. stores with varying levels of automation with six more centers in active stages of construction. Currently, more than 15% of stores receive merchandise from these facilities, helping to get product to shelves faster and more efficiently. During the quarter, we opened our third next-generation e-commerce fulfillment center. These 1.5 million square feet facilities are expected to more than double the storage capacity, enable 2X the number of customer orders fulfilled daily, and will expand next and two-day shipping to nearly 90% of the U.S. including marketplace items shipped by Walmart Fulfillment Services. They also unlock new opportunities for our associates to transition into higher skilled tech focused positions. To support the store fulfilled digital business, we're on-track to have seven stores with automated market fulfillment centers or MFCs operational by the end of this month. These MFCs start thousands of the most sought after items and are expected to increase order capacity and productivity, while also increasing inventory accuracy, which helps us deliver perfect orders for customers. As we focus on improving e-commerce margins, we're making good progress in lowering digital fulfillment cost and densifying the last mile by tapping our broad store and club network. Over the past year, Walmart U.S. has increased the percentage of digital orders fulfilled by stores by 800 basis points and Sam's Club fulfills nearly 60% of online orders from its clubs. With the growth of our Spark Driver platform, we've lowered store to home delivery costs by 15% even as we shorten delivery times the same day for more than 80% of our stores and in some cases as quick as 30 minutes. As we scale Walmart GoLocal, we are densifying the last mile, and we're approaching the milestone of 12 million deliveries for other retailers with this service. I'd like to touch on our portfolio of higher growth initiatives. These businesses reinforce our core omni-retail model in our key to driving operating income growth ahead of sales over time. In Q3, this portfolio positively contributed to gross margins. Global advertising grew approximately 20% in Q3 with Sam's Map growing over 27% and Walmart Connect, up 26%. As an illustration of the omnichannel benefits of our ad platforms, more than 75% of Sam's Map active advertisers are investing in search and sponsored ads as in-club sales attribution has improved returns of digital ad spend by over 30%. International's ad revenue growth was impacted by the timing of Big Billion Days, but we're on track to deliver strong growth of approximately 45% for the full year. Moving to marketplace and fulfillment services. Customer engagement continues to validate our strategy is to invest in ways to grow this business on a global basis. As Doug mentioned, we held the inaugural Marketplace Seller Summit to help accelerate our marketplace growth. For cross-border sellers in the U.S., we're expanding access to more customers beyond the U.S., Canada and Mexico by opening our e-commerce marketplace in Chile to cross-border products next year. Over the past year, we've increased marketplace sellers by more than 20% and the number of sellers utilizing Walmart Fulfillment Services is up over 55%. Next, membership remains a compelling way we deepen engagement with our customers. Sam's Club membership income grew over 7%, reflecting record member counts and Plus Member penetration. During Q3, we held events that were focused on member acquisition and digital engagement. We'll take a similar approach again during Q4 offering discounted access to Walmart Plus memberships while providing members early access to the best savings event throughout the holiday season. Turning back to the middle of the P&L. SG&A expenses deleveraged 37 basis points on an adjusted basis, impacted by higher year-over-year wage related cost in Walmart U.S., including higher variable pay expenses relative to last year when we were below our planned performance. Store remodel costs were also higher as we rolled out 117 of our flagship design stores earlier this month and legal expenses increased. Lastly, the timing shift of Big Billion Days pressured international expense leverage in Q3, we'll see the benefit come through in Q4. Third quarter adjusted operating income grew 3%, including 270 basis points of currency tailwind, while adjusted EPS of $1.53 increased 2% and compared favorably to guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Relative to our guidance, Q3 EPS benefited by $0.01 from releasing the LIFO reserve we had earmarked for Sam's Club. Moving to returns. Over the last 12 months, sales have grown more than 6% and operating income increased about 22% and when combined with a disciplined capital approach, return on investment improved 130 basis points to 14.1%. The primary driver was lapping last year's Q3 charge related to the opioid legal settlement framework. ROI also reflects some benefits from productivity initiatives that we initially expected to realize in FY '25. We continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years. In addition to our strategy, our financial position is an advantage and enables us to compete in an increasingly dynamic retail environment. Turning to guidance. We're confident in our agility and our ability to execute and we're focusing our investment in areas where we can widen our omni advantage, deepen engagement and drive sustained growth in new revenue streams. We like our position relative to competitors as we've maintained strong price gaps and increased share while preserving flexibility to respond to competitive dynamics. But we're not immune from the vagaries of the economy. We see our customers showing ongoing discretion in making trade-offs to be able to afford the things they want given the sustained high cost of the things they need. Recently, we've experienced a higher degree of variability and weekly performance in between holiday events in the U.S., including seeing a softening in the back half of October, it was off-trend to the rest of the quarter. Sales during November have turned higher as unseasonal weather abated and we kicked-off holiday events. So sales have been somewhat uneven and this gives us reason to think slightly more cautiously about the consumer versus 90 days ago. We still expect sales growth to moderate in Q4 versus prior quarters as grocery inflation further normalizes towards historic levels. So we're encouraged by the increased traffic and share gains we've seen and expect them to continue. As such, we are modestly raising our full year sales guidance to 5% to 5.5% from 4% to 4.5% previously primarily to reflect Q3's outperformance. For operating income, we're maintaining the guidance range of 7% to 7.5% growth. In addition to the 40 basis points of unexpected legal expenses in Q3, we also expect to record charges in Q4, totaling approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points related to unplanned store closures and recovery costs associated with the recent hurricane near Acapulco, Mexico. This impacted 28 of our stores and less than half of them have been reopened at this time. Partially offsetting these costs is the approximate 40 basis point benefit from lower than expected LIFO charges compared to our prior guide. The net effect is a 20 basis point to 30 basis point headwind to our prior guide and as such, we currently expect to be in the lower end of the operating income growth range for the year. We expect merchandise mix pressure to continue in Q4 with grocery and health and wellness sales rates outpacing general merchandise and potentially be a bit more pronounced given the uncertain consumer environment. Based on Q3 results and less of an increase in interest cost for the year than we previously expected, we're raising our full year EPS guidance range to $6.40 to $6.48. In closing, let me reiterate what I said previously, aligned with our financial framework, we expect the relationship between profit and sales growth to favor profitability in Q4 and for the full year operating income to grow faster than sales. We like our competitive position. Our financial results clearly demonstrate that our omnichannel strategy is winning. We're growing our share across categories, deepening customer engagement across channels, while investing in areas to widen our competitive advantage. The holidays are here and our value proposition resonates with customers looking to save money as they celebrate. Operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have one question, I'll make it maybe two-parts. The first part, the legal expense it -- so that we can judge whether or not we should keep it in. It sounds like you're keeping it in. I'm not sure you're able to share what the nature of it is, but it seems like it was unexpected. So if there's any more color on it. And then the second real question is, alternative revenue and profit. Was it hidden in any way this quarter? Do we get an inflection, into next year, that seems to be the big investment question. And are we going to see it ramp up, and does it happen in a certain period or it just continues to build? Thank you. John David Rainey : Simeon, I'll start and others may want to jump in. On the legal expenses, those were related to -- largely related to prior periods, and that was not anticipated within the quarter. It's around $70 million to $75 million. So we would not expect that to recur into the fourth quarter. On the alternative revenue perhaps, I'll start and let others jump in. Our plan is that we shared at Investor Day is somewhat dependent upon the level of investments that we're having and seeing improving unit economics, but it's also growing these parts of our business that are much higher margin. We talked about the growth in advertising across all segments quite frankly and international while it was slower in this quarter, we'll see strong growth for the year. All of these as they becoming a larger part of our overall business mix, you're going to have an outsized contribution to our margin performance. So if you go back and you think about what we shared at Investor Day saying that we expect over the next several years to grow sales 4% and operating income greater than 4%, we would expect with each passing year, we're going to see a greater contribution from these higher margin profit streams, which help us to improve our margin each year. Doug McMillon : Simeon this is Doug. I would just add that I think you should have it in the continue to build category rather than in inflection. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just another follow-up, I guess on the legal expense. Assuming that impacted the U.S. EBIT number, but maybe you can clarify that. And just anything in particular that impacted the U.S. EBIT beyond maybe some unexpected expenses, did that come in relatively in line with your expectations? And I guess that's sort of my first question. And then longer-term, as you think about this plan to grow EBIT faster than sales in coming years, anything you're seeing with the consumer? And it sounds like it's still choppy that maybe leaves you to reconsider how much you might flow through to the bottom-line? John David Rainey : Sure. I'll start and then, John, is probably going to want to jump in. Yes, the legal expenses hit the U.S. segment. There were some other items in there, like, I'll point out that we spent a little bit more on remodels. We did an all-time high level of remodels in the quarter. But this is investing in our business, which we definitely want to lean into. We're excited about the returns we're seeing around that. We're excited about the returns you're seeing on e-commerce. And so there were some investments related to that, but the vast majority of the delta between our guidance and actual performance was related to the legal accrual. In terms of our long-term plan, and as it pertains to like possible changes in the consumer, I think our value proposition resonates more than ever when the consumer is pressured. And we've seen this year that they not only are coming to us for the value that we provide, but also for the convenience and these are areas that we're investing in. So we have a ton of conviction in the strategy that we have in our -- in place and our ability to execute on that. We should separate that from calling out some maybe potential weakness or wobbling among the consumer that we saw in the back half of October. But we're very excited about the plan we have in place. John Furner : Hi, Kelly. It's John. Good morning. First, I'm also excited about the topline results at 49% (ph) and then e-commerce at 24%, the team has made a lot of improvements, they should get the credit for that. You heard a couple of things there, one about remodels. As John David mentioned, we had a 117 remodels complete all on November 3. We think that's the largest number of remodels, we've ever had complete in a single day. And then if you add together late October and November, it was 197 remodels and those remodels have improved, apparel improved, home, they have wider aisles. We're really happy with the way the signing layout and they also have more investment for our online pickup and delivery business, which is a key catalyst for e-commerce growth and help us with being flexible for customers and any type of situation, they want to shop in, so there is some costs associated with that in the quarter but we feel great about those being investments for the long-term. Doug McMillon : Kelly, this is Doug. And related to the last part of what you asked about, I don't think there's anything that causes us to think operating income won't grow faster than sales. We've had really strong sales performance now for a few years. Obviously, we were impacted by what happens in our environment, but we expect to grow share. We expect to have a healthy topline and as it relates to operating income, we've got a really good multiyear plan with two primary dimensions, one is the automation investments that will -- that drives productivity improvements and the other dimension is related to how the digital business has changed the shape of the income statement. Both of those things will be true, and it's a multi-year plan that shows progress along the way. So you guys from quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year will see us make progress, and not every quarter, maybe up into the right in every category, but if you look at what happens from a trend point-of-view, those are the things we expect to deliver and because operating income is growing faster than sales, we -- our plan requires that we grow return on investment at a higher rate over time. That's the plan. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez : Hey. Thanks, guys. You have a really big e-com business that continues to grow at a rapid pace. I'm curious if you could talk about what's driving that growth from a traffic versus ticket perspective and how the growth in the marketplace sellers that you've seen are contributing to that growth. Also, curious if you could talk a little bit about general merchandise performance online. I think you threw out some numbers last quarter about certain categories on the general merchandise side, would love to hear how they performed online this quarter. Thanks. John Furner : Hi. Good morning, Paul. It's John, I'll start with Walmart U.S. and then pass it over to Kath and Chris to talk about the other segments. I think if -- as you step back and look at the growth, one, we're pleased with our online pickup delivery business from stores, we have strength in food. The team has continued over the last few years to expand our capacity, and more importantly, they made improvements on key metrics like the one we call Perfect Order which is getting customers what they want, when they want, and I think that's a reflection of better in-stock in food, overall that's helped us with our share gains and the food category. With marketplace really pleased with the progress the team has made with Tom Ward and Manish having their First Summit as we mentioned earlier. In the quarter, we're seeing more sellers come online, our assortment has grown significantly. And just this week, I was in one of the new fulfillment centers that John David mentioned, the Lancaster, Texas which is a great facility managed by a very qualified team and it's of course reassuring to see the amount of marketplace inventory that's come again and seeing the number of marketplace sellers which we're grateful for those sellers who trust us to do their fulfillment and that's been -- that's been promising. Now, in the month of November, we had our first event last week and getting into our holiday season, we have a long way to go from here until the end of holidays. But, really pleased with the results in marketplace, which is of course reflective of results in art and apparel, and gifting and other categories that are in line with the question you asked about general merchandise. So these are important businesses because they help customers shop the way they shop with -- the way they want to shop, when they want to shop. And marketplace over time, of course, will be a key driver to some of the other businesses like advertising as more sellers find customers on the Walmart Marketplace, they'll want to use services like our fulfillment services and our advertising business. So, turn it over to Kath to talk about international. Kathryn McLay : Yeah. Thank you for that question. I think if you look at our e-commerce outlook, it's minus 3 and that's I don't think is a really -- it's distorted by Baby Day. If you actually look at the underlying growth across the businesses, Walmex grew by 16% from an e-com perspective, Canada grew by e-com -- in e-com by 16%, a part of that was rolling out Delivery Pass to the number -- toward a significant number of stores. If you look at China, their business grew -- their e-com business grew by 38%, so I think all of the teams are really focused on really getting the disciplines right of a perfect order and making sure that the experience to the customer is delightful. I think we continue to learn from each of the different businesses. The Flipkart team were here with us yesterday and it's fascinating to see what they're learning through using gen AI in the -- in three big -- three Big Billion Days. There's just some really clever capability that make it very seamless and easy to be able to shop online. And then, if you look at it from a marketplace perspective, we launched in Mexico, Canada, Chile and South Africa marketplace during the last 12 months. Obviously, Flipkart is our largest and most and more mature marketplace business. But we are seeing accelerated marketplace growth also through our cross-border trade. We opened that through Mexico and Canada to U.S. cross-border sellers. And lastly, we launched Walmart Fulfillment Services in Mexico, Canada and South Africa in the past 12 months. So we're seeing good results, but we're really positive about the growth potential of both Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. Chris Nicholas : So, it's exciting time. Paul, thanks for the question. I think what's really interesting for all of us, but definitely for Sam's is that members want this, and so we're giving them what they want and we are at 13% of sales, 16% growth in the quarter. But we think it's a really huge opportunity, and as I think about e-commerce for and omnichannel sales for Sam's, I think about a digitally connected member. So Scan and Go teaches our members that we are a digitally relevant business and they look to shop online and on the -- whether on the web or on the apps and we feel really good about that. We've got all-time highs in that space. The other thing is really interesting is, as we look at the new members. We got an all-time high number of membership in Sam's and a lot of those people that are coming in now with digitally engaged members that coming in and they're buying new memberships digitally. So we're feeling good. In terms of mix, GM and a Club Pick (ph), so grocery, pantry they're all strong, which we're feeling good about. We don't have a marketplace in Sam's yet, we're very focused on items and on curation of great items and I think that's going to be really important for the Sam's business as we go forward. And the thing that I finished with, there is the great items, drive the organic traffic. So we'll continue to focus on those great items and I think we'll get a lot -- we'll continue to get a lot of organic traffic there. Doug McMillon : On U.S., so also asked about general merchandise. Would you repeat that part of the question? Paul Lejuez : I was just curious how general merchandise performed online within the U.S. business. I think, last time, you said there were several categories that were up double-digits, curious how some of those general merch categories performed. Doug McMillon : Yeah, Paul. Really positive strength in categories like hardlines, our auto care center is running really well and the events that we talked about. I had mentioned earlier. It's great to see momentum with strong toy items and customers are responding to great gifts, like the Barbie Malibu House which is selling for $69, was $89 before it wanted to rollbacks, so those types of items are working really well. Customers also great to see -- after the redesign of the -- how the team is merchandising, general merchandise reflective of the seasons' RIN (ph). The site was really on point for Halloween before that for Labor Day. And you'll see the site flip quite frequently. So the team is doing a nice job reacting in categories to the plans that they have, but there's some categories there were strengthened. And as I said, there's still a long way between here and the holidays. We have a good plan. Our people are ready, your inventory is in position. So, we're ready for our customers. Paul Lejuez : Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. We are wondering if you could go into any more detail as to what would explain a softening in late October. Do you think it could partially be due to student loans or is it more of a function of being a shoulder period or a low before the holiday? And just the variability you're seeing week-to-week that you noted increase the risk in being more promotional than maybe was originally planned and expected in Q4. John David Rainey : Kate, this is John David, I'll take this. You're right to call out some of the economic factors that may be driving this. We're seeing credit tightening. We're in a period of time 12 months after the Fed has begun raising rates. We've seen consumer balance sheets that are getting back close to pre-pandemic levels. You've got the repayment of student loans, which affects about 27 million Americans. So all of these things could be contributing. I do want to point out, John talked about the impact of weather can have on our business. I'm learning that that can have profound effects in consumer shopping patterns. And we saw anomalous weather in the back half of October. So there is a number of different reasons, we can't put our finger on is exactly. And so that's why we take a little bit more of a cautious stance as we go into the fourth quarter, calling out perhaps more variability because there are some trends that have been different than what we saw the first 11 weeks of the quarter. Not to be alarmist, so I think our business is still performing really well. That's why we called out what we've seen thus far in November. In particular, the events that we've had. Walmart U.S., some of the more festive events internationally, we've seen strong response from our customers. But that this is -- this was -- the trend we saw in the back half of October was different than anything else we've seen this year. And so we simply want to call that out. In regards to promotion, maybe the segment CEOs want to comment on this, but I feel like we're in a good place from overall an inventory level. I don't necessarily see a more promotional holiday season than what we were currently planning. John Furner : This is John. Kate, good morning. I think what's encouraging is that our traffic, our transaction counts, remained strong and consistent throughout the quarter. The end of October, we did grow our Halloween business a little less than we expected. I'm sure there's something to do with weather and it being on a Tuesday, which is different than prior years. And then as we got in November with the cold weather, we saw cold weather categories respond right away. Our event was strong, so John David said it right. We're just cautious of the shift that we did see. But overall seeing the number of customers who shop continue to grow. We've seen new customers all year across a wide variety of income groups. We'll be ready for all those customers and we'll be ready for anything that they need at the time. I really like the flexibility the team has built-in. We delivered Halloween up until 06 :00 PM on the date of the holiday, which is something we haven't been able to do before. So our Express and same day delivery service continues to grow, which is helping us right up until the point customers need product. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Looking towards next year, how linear will the relationship be between Walmart's overall comp and the operating income growth? So if you only comp 2%, let's say, could you still grow operating income at the higher end of your range, call it 7% to 8%? And how does the prospect of broad-based deflation impact that, especially, as some of the naysayers say, that Walmart's comp in recent quarters has just been driven by the impact of inflation? Thank you. John David Rainey : Well, Michael, it's good to speak with you. One of the things that we're looking at closely in our business is units, and we've seen good growth in units, so it has not been entirely driven by just higher prices. We think we're positioned well as we go into the end of this year and into next year. To answer your question, it would depend upon what's driving the 2% comp. And so it's hard to extrapolate trends from this year into that. The team here, though, is very focused on what could happen in a more deflationary environment and making sure that we're --we have a cost structure that supports the revenue environment that we operate in. So when you think about the relationship between operating income and sales on a multi-year basis, we actually feel like we're in a really strong position given what's happening in the business from one quarter to the next that may not always be the case as we manage through certain headwinds, but we feel like we're positioned well for virtually any economic environment. And I'll remind you, like I know there's maybe trepidation or concern among consumer health. This is when we shine. This is when Walmart is at its best when we can deliver value for our members and customers. And so we look forward to being able to put up financial results in any economic environment. John Furner : Michael, we want to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep prices as low as possible for our customers. I'm really pleased in the U.S. business that our rollback count is up significantly over last year. It was a lot of fun to be able to tell all of our customers that Thanksgiving at Walmart this year will be a lower price than what it was a year ago. We worked really hard the last two years to keep it flat, and it's coming down, and that's great for customers. You had really stubborn inflation in categories like dry grocery. So I'm excited when I'm in stores. And I was in Uvalde, Texas the other day, the number of rollbacks that we have out on feature in front of customers right up front in categories like dry grocery. A lot of our fresh categories have come in line. Eggs and dairy have come back in line from a year ago. That's great for customers. And as John David said, that's the time that we win. We deliver value and our team's ready to do that in any condition. Michael Lasser : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. And I had a question just on the SG&A line. So at least in the Walmart U.S. business, it appears both wage inflation and remodels appear to be a significant headwind on that line. So just curious if you expect those headwinds to continue into next year? John Furner : Yeah, Rupesh. Good morning. It's John. The remodels really that was a big number of remodels ahead. I mentioned earlier 197 remodels completed between late October and November 3. Of course, we'll continue our remodel program throughout next year. We have a good plan on the number of sites and we're excited about the results that we're seeing. From those, we definitely hear and know that our results change for categories like apparel, home. So I think we're -- we have a good plan there. It was a higher number at the end of the quarter and the end of the month than what we had originally planned for. Some had slipped in the later period. So I think we'll have a good balance as we move forward. On wages. We're staffed, ready for the holiday. For the most part, stores and distribution centers are completely staffed. There are some locations that will continue to hire, and we didn't go out this year with a large number of people that we intended to hire for the holiday. We're happy with our full-time part-time ratio and where we need hours the next few weeks, which is really next week for food leading into the event Wednesday going into the Thanksgiving holidays and Black Friday, we'll be ready to manage the business with our existing associates. Rupesh Parikh : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Krisztina Katai : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On general merchandise, the low to mid=single digit deflation that you're seeing relative to the comp that you put up would imply maybe that the units have improved sequentially. So one, can you talk about what you are seeing in units, your current price gap this holiday, and how might you be thinking about price versus units dynamic into next year. And then two, I just wanted to see if Kath and Chris would like to share their initial reflections on the new roles? John Furner : So the first question is about units and general merchandise, and as prices have come down, are we seeing [indiscernible] units go up? Chris Nicholas : Thanks for that, Krisztina (ph). So let's talk about general merchandise first. Customers are responding to rollbacks. I mentioned one earlier in the Barbie category, which is the Malibu Dream House. So we see that consistently across other items in toys and toys is top of mind because it's the Christmas, whether it's the Melissa and Doug home set that's rolled by $10 to $25. We have the old classic Furby. That's $49 down for $59. Really good unit movements. We -- we're also happy to see, as I said earlier, the number of rollbacks that are across the entire store and the assortment of over 50% over last year. So customers are responding. But most importantly, our team is proud to offer great values and lower prices to customers. We've been in a pretty steep inflationary environment the last couple of years, so it's good to see some of these prices come back in line. And as far as how we think about that going forward, we mentioned this earlier that the results in e-commerce are quite encouraging at plus 24% for the quarter, and the breadth of the offer in e-commerce as it develops, I think is quite encouraging with growth of the marketplace, continued acceleration of the online pickup delivery business, and our first party business. And as we get into this holiday season, the team has worked really hard on inventory positioning, the condition in stores. Our MPS levels are at a really good spot and have continued to improve. And I think the result of that is we've had consistent traffic growth throughout the quarter and we continue to see that, which is a good sign for what may be to come. Doug McMillon : I think it's going to be interesting to watch how the dynamic plays out between general merchandise and food. So if you've got food prices, if you click -- double click on that dry grocery versus fresh and think about where prices are compared to a year ago. In general, they're still up and the two-year stack is high. But in some fresh categories, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing prices come down. On the GM side as things have come down, it's come down kind of steep in the last few weeks, maybe relative to what we had seen before. And so I think it's to be seen if the food prices come down in dry grocery and consumables and we start seeing deflation in those categories, that'll free up dollars to be spent in general merchandise. And with the rollback positioning and some of the prices we're hitting, it makes sense that people would be able to shift back to GM as they shop the box or the app. The great thing about our position is we don't really care. Like, they can buy whatever they want to buy. We're positioned for food, we're positioned with fresh, we're positioned with apparel and with hardlines and with holiday season, with categories like toys. So we've got a good value, regardless of which category and department you look at. And we'll play the shift as it happens. And if we end up where both sides, food and GM are deflated, then we just need to focus on driving even more units to your point. But if they've got dollars to spend, they'll spend them, and we're there for that and we can do it in store club, we can do it with pickup, we can do it with delivery. So we feel good about our position. We'll just manage it as the weeks and months play out and are as fascinated to watch it as you are. Kath, how's the job going? Kathryn McLay : Yeah, Krisztina. Thanks for the question. I would say, first of all, it's incredible that it's only been a quarter since I stepped into the role. It's -- Judith and the team have honed a really exciting portfolio of businesses, and it's been great to be able to get out into the markets. I've, over the last quarter, been in Mexico, China and India, and just looking at the pace of transformation and the way the teams rise to the challenge to be relevant in those local communities is extraordinary. And the ability to cross-learn between markets is such a great gift that we have in the international business. So I've been impressed by the strength of the teams that we have out there and also just really impressed by how they're translating our purpose and mission to save people money so they can live better into being really relevant. So whether it's in Canada, where they were able to actually have a Thanksgiving meal at a price lower than last year, whether it was in Walmex -- sorry in Mexico, where they've held down prices on basket -- a basket of essential items, no matter where it is, where you are in the international portfolio, the teams are working really hard to be relevant and help those communities celebrate the holiday and festivals that are rolling out over this -- over Q3 and into Q4. So excited to join the team. Chris Nicholas : Okay. Thanks, Kathryn. And Krisztina, thanks for the question. I think probably I'd just like to start with the prerogative that I have of now running this business to thank the Sam's Club associates for such a brilliant quarter and for the hard work that they have done to deliver that set of results. They're a team I'm really proud of and I'm grateful to be part of that club, and honestly, it's kind of a lot of fun to be here, and Kath knows that and told me that would be the case. I'm really grateful for the strong foundation that the Sam's Club team has built. It's a brilliant talent, a deep bench of merchant talent and it's -- I mean, it really is a merchant-led business. We've got an amazing member-led culture, fantastic clubs and associates, great items, strong brand in member's mark, and the beginnings of a world-class e-commerce business. And all of that drives really strong member value. So I see a really unique opportunity for Sam's to use this momentum as a jumping off point to accelerate, to driving growth through digital engagement, offering unique value through great items that consumers can't get anywhere else, and a deep understanding of members in a way that will make us more relevant to them both in club and digitally, so we can appeal to an even broader set of consumers. So, yeah, a lot to go for. Really exciting. So thanks for asking. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Robert Ohmes : Thanks for taking my question. Actually, it's a follow-up question on deflation. I was hoping Doug or anyone else could just talk about. Just to clarify what's driving the LIFO tailwinds? Is it all general merchandise right now or is there grocery in there and Doug, you mentioned lowering grocery prices, but you also mentioned, I think, stubborn inflation still out there in your opening comments and so is there -- just maybe even a little more color, like is dry grocery getting set to deflate? Is that what you guys are seeing? And then also, where do wage pressures come in? Do you think wage pressures are also sort of disinflating now? John David Rainey : Robbie, good to speak with you. This is John David. I'll start and address the LIFO part of the question and maybe hand it over to Doug and others. On the improvements that we've made there. That is, as you know, dependent upon the cost of goods that we're buying. And we've seen the pricing level come down overall broadly. But I don't want to miss the point to mention that our teams have actually done a really good job of working with suppliers to help affect that outcome. So this is not something that just happens to us. The team has worked to actually have this outcome, so it's far better than what we expected when we went into the beginning of the year, and we're actually pleased to see this outcome. Robert Ohmes : And John David, is that -- is just to clarify, is that general merchandise vendors or is that all vendors, including grocery vendors? John David Rainey : It's across all categories. It probably skews a little bit more to consumables and GM, Doug McMillon : Robbie, this is Doug. Generally across markets, we have an inflationary environment. The U.S., and what we went through here the last few years is more dramatic than what I'd seen in the U.S. But of course had experienced that in Brazil and Argentina and other places. China is not really inflated. That's an outlier as it relates to this conversation. But in the U.S. specifically, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, in the fresh categories, you see beef up, but dairy, eggs, chicken, seafood down. So commodities will do what commodities will do. General merchandise had been coming down and came down a little more aggressively in the last few weeks or months than the trend before that, which we think is a really good thing. But it does start to have an impact on dollars when units -- when the units don't go up enough to offset the deflationary impact as it relates to GM. The dry grocery and consumables question feels like the key question Will it come down? Will those categories come down? We hope they will. On a two-year stack in Walmart US, John, I think we're still mid-double digits, slightly up versus a year ago. But we think we may see dry grocery and consumables start to deflate in the coming weeks and months. And so as we look ahead to next year, we could find ourselves in Walmart U.S. with a deflationary environment. And John David mentioned earlier, that causes us to think about what are we doing with expenses. Are we ready for that? It's too early to call how dramatic it'll be. And as we mentioned earlier, we are happy about it. We want our customers and members to have lower prices, and we'll manage mix, and we'll manage through it better than anyone. And it doesn't change anything about our plan. All the things that we've been doing to change, to be able to serve people in new ways, like with pickup and delivery, the expansion of the marketplace, all the things that flow from that, that help us with operating income, all those things are still true regardless of what the top line dollar growth rate looks like as a total enterprise. And for a while now, we've been talking about four and greater than four. If you look back at the last three years, I'm hard-pressed to remember 2019 seems like a long time ago, but 2019 grew faster than 2018 on a calendar year basis. So we had a trending growth rate moving the right direction, and then the pandemic hits, and then inflation hits. So if you look back at the last three or four years, We've been growing faster than four. If we find ourselves in a deflationary environment next year and we grow at four or a little less than four, or around four, as long as we're growing share and improving what we're doing for customers and members on the top line, that'll be what it'll be. We'll get as much as we earn, but the operating income percentage will still go up because we've got this automation plan and we've got the digital businesses reshaping the income statement, which will help returns. So the plan is the plan we are executing. We're just trying to communicate with you today as we release our results, what we saw the last part of October in Walmart U.S. in particular, communicate what happened with expenses. But fundamentally, what's happening here is exactly what was happening here three months ago, six months ago, we are executing our plan. Robert Ohmes : And just anything on wage pressures, Doug? Doug McMillon : Wage inflation is not as bad as it was before. We \u2013 as John mentioned earlier what happened in Walmart U.S. I'm not worried about wages. We've got an appropriate wage improvement for our associates planned for next year. I think we're in good shape. We're staffed, we've got a good plan. Not concerned about that aspect of it. Robert Ohmes : Great. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Sure. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. So another question, actually, on remodels, I know you had a lot over the last couple of months, as you referred to, but given the strong returns on the remodels, does it make sense to continue to accelerate that process even if it holds back earnings flow through a bit in the near term? And then related to that, if you do accelerate the process, where do you have to go on the timeline to where you start to see more benefit than incremental expense on a net basis? Thanks. John Furner : I think the short answer is -- it does make it does make sense to accelerate, and we have accelerated. So we will complete this year a couple of hundred more than we did the last few years. So the number of remodels has gone up. The team has got much more, I'd say got their arms around the process, the new fixtures, the changes. So the remodels are happening a bit quicker and more smoothly than they were years past. And also the supply chain is helping. We were doing remodels in '21 and '22, where we had a hard time getting fixtures and getting parts and getting the equipment in on time. So we're feeling better about the way these are all coming together. The performance of the remodels we are -- I mean, we continue to be pleased with on the top line, we continue to be pleased with the MPS numbers. We see the customer reaction of the new assortment, particularly, as I mentioned earlier, apparel, pets, beauty, home, a number of categories is really great. And I mentioned I was in one that completed just a couple of weeks ago in Uvalde, Texas. And you know it's just such great -- such a great investment in the community. It makes the store feel new, refreshed. People are -- there's a different look in their eye and a smile. The associates are thrilled with the results and they were really proud of it. And as we go on the holidays, I think that customers will really love to see in these communities all across the U.S. more access to different products than they had before. And one of the things that's important in all these remodel processes is that the customer notices the difference and they notice the difference not only in the facility but in the product. And I think we're delivering both of those in the remodel. So we'll continue an aggressive plan for the remodel locations into next year Scot Ciccarelli : And so is there a headwind to profit flow through as that process continues at that pace? John Furner : No, it's in the plan. What happened in Q3 is a few that had been in process, slipped into late October, and then 117 on one day was quite a big number. So what you'll see going forward is a more balanced of remodels completing by quarter. Ideally, we would have liked to complete -- we wouldn't want to have those so close to the holiday. I think the teams have done a nice job of finishing the remodels and then getting back right into merchandising for the holiday. So to be more even across quarters, but that's all built into our plan. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. John Furner : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward Kelly : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the gross margin in the US, the margin was not touched year over year. I think the expectation was that it maybe could have been better than that. I was hoping that you could provide some of the puts and takes around that. I'm not sure if GLP-1 is maybe having a bigger impact there. So just thoughts on the gross margin this quarter and then maybe how we should think about that in Q4 and then a clarification around the legal charge. I think you said $75 million, but then 40 basis points. So I'm not really sure. I'm a little bit confused about that. Thank you. John David Rainey : Yeah. The legal charge is 40 basis points, go with that number. And as it relates to our guidance for the year, I'll point out that 7% to 7.5% operating income on our business is $125 million. That is really more -- it's kind of a precise number for the size business that we are. And so that the magnitude of some of these things, like the hurricane, like the legal charges, push us to the lower end of that range for the year. On general merchandise, we did see some of the impact from business mix in the quarter. We benefited from that. The U.S. was up, I think, 5 bps, if I remember correctly. But as Doug noted, too, like we're certainly trying to be -- to lower prices for our customers and make sure that we're providing the value that they need. So there's a balance of all of that that's impacting those numbers. Edward Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just GLP-1 just came up here in that last question, just curious. We hear it's a thing, maybe expand on maybe what you're seeing there, how it's impacting your business currently and what you see for that going forward. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Hey, Peter. Good morning. Thanks for the question. No, it's still early to -- and time will tell how this affects the customer and affects the business. As we said before, we're seeing some shifts in categories, but right now, we really don't have anything else to add above and beyond what we've said in the past. Peter Benedict : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Seth Sigman : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up on the consumer. I know it was discussed quite a few times today, but you guys, throughout the year have discussed a number of different signals of sensitivity, buying more around paycheck cycles, seeking more value, coming up with a promotional event. So just curious if you could provide a little bit more perspective on that and maybe more specifically what you are seeing in terms of market share across income cohorts. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Yeah for Walmart U.S. specifically, John, as it relates to share. John Furner : Yeah. Good. Thanks for asking, Seth. We've been pleased to see share growth all year, and we've talked about that across income groups. And what's been encouraging as of late is a bit higher share growth in general merchandise categories. We saw that month by month throughout the third quarter. Doug McMillon : I don't know that we have a lot more to add on the consumer than what we've already said. I think we covered it. We're well positioned and I think our value proposition across categories and the way we're serving people, which helps them save time as well as save money, causes us to feel good about our position for the quarter. We get a lot of questions about what's happening in the U.S. economy and other economies and what's happening with the consumer, and we feel compelled sometimes to try and help explain what we're seeing. But to be clear from our point of view, we are front-footed, offensive, and feeling good about our opportunities. Stores and clubs look good. So that's the way we're thinking about the quarter. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Yeah. I'll just wrap up here. We've gone a little over time. I'm as excited as I have been. We're executing our plan. We've got a good plan. Customers and members are choosing us, and I think they have been choosing us not only because of price leadership, which they can count on and we will continue but also because we're making it easier to shop with us. Our MPS scores in stores and clubs are encouraging. Our MPS scores as they're improving across pickup and delivery, are encouraging. We just want to save people money and time and make this easy and help them have a great holiday season. And I think as it relates to the top line, we can continue to expect that we will outperform and do well. And as it relates to operating income growth, we'll grow it faster than sales over time because we've got this really good automation plan. The metrics that John David outlined when we started the call are really encouraging. We continue to feel very good about what that's going to mean for our business. And then as it relates to the business mix, having e-commerce grow so much across our segments is awesome and encouraging. And as a reminder, that's a combination of first and third party. And as we grow with our suppliers and also with our marketplace sellers, we get those opportunities to serve them with ads, to serve them through fulfillment services, to monetize our data in different ways. So the business model change will continue, which will enable that operating income growth to help us improve returns over time. So we're antsy about Christmas every year. This is my 33 year and I feel like it's a bit of a rerun in that it seems like we're always talking about customers being price-conscious, and we always will be. And they're always looking for the hot toy and the right gift for Christmas. And they'll come buy food for us for Thanksgiving and for the Christmas meal. And then New Year's will come, and we'll have clearance prices after Christmas, and we'll have a strong January because customers will react to clearance at least the first couple of weeks when that's happening. And we'll update you on the fourth quarter and tell you how it went. But we feel really good about our position and excited about executing this plan and appreciate your ongoing support and interest in our company. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to Walmart's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin. Steph Wissink : Thank you, and welcome, everyone. The format of today's call will follow prior quarters. First, our CEO Doug McMillon will share his reflections on the quarter and year. Then our CFO, John David Rainey will review our Q4 and fiscal 2024 results, provide perspective on the key drivers of our financial framework, and offer initial guidance for fiscal 2025. Following these remarks, we will take your questions. At that time, we will be joined by our segment CEOs, John Furner from Walmart US; Kath McLay from Walmart International; and Chris Nicholas from Sam's Club. In order to address as many questions as we can, please limit yourself to one question. Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor Statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, we are now ready to begin. Doug McMillon : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to talk about our business. Our team delivered a great quarter, finishing off a strong year. We drove sales growth of 4.9% and adjusted operating profit growth of 10.9% in constant currency. Highlights include : higher transaction counts and unit volumes; gains in market share in the U.S. and internationally; improved in-stock levels with inventory being in great shape and down versus last year; strong performance in Walmart U.S. customer experience scores, even during the high volume days before Christmas. Plus, this year, we passed $100 billion in global e-commerce sales for the first time. We had a very good holiday season. We were strong in the US, Mexico, Canada, and India, where we had the best Big Billion Days ever, and we continued the strong performance in China with the start of Chinese New Year. Typically, we see some of our customer experience scores dip during the high volume hours and days we experience during the holidays. But during Q4, the Walmart U.S. team delivered three year high customer scores in our stores, for pickup and delivery from stores, and for those orders that flow directly from our e-commerce fulfillment centers. I'm excited about the omni-channel net promoter score trends the team is driving. Across countries, we continue to see a customer that's resilient, but looking for value. As always, we're working hard to deliver that for them, including through our rollbacks on food pricing in Walmart U.S. Those were up significantly in Q4 versus last year, following a big increase in Q3. Our general merchandise prices are lower than a year ago, and even two years ago in some categories, which means our customers are finding value in areas like apparel and hardlines. In food, prices are lower than a year ago in places like eggs, apples, and deli snacks, but higher in other places like asparagus and blackberries. Dry grocery and consumables categories like paper goods and cleaning supplies are up mid-single digits versus last year, and high teens versus two years ago. Private brand penetration is up in many of the countries where we operate, including the United States. During our Q3 call, I mentioned that we might find ourselves in a deflationary position early in calendar 2024. In Walmart U.S., we're there in general merchandise, but the slope of the decline softened during Q4, meaning the prices are lower than a year ago, but not as much as the trend line would have suggested at the end of Q3. We saw the trend line for food and consumables in Walmart U.S. soften too, resulting in our retail prices in food and consumables being slightly higher than a year ago. In total, for Walmart U.S., our year-end retail prices on like-for-like items were inflated by about 80 basis points. Importantly, we're encouraged by our strength in terms of units and transactions. Sam's Club U.S. is in a similar pricing position to Walmart U.S., and outside the U.S. our pricing comparisons to a year ago are in more of a normal range. We're excited about the momentum we see and we're pleased with the quarter, but my focus stays primarily on what we're building for the longer term. That future is an omni-channel one where we simultaneously strengthen our stores and clubs and build a more compelling ecommerce business. As it relates to strengthening our stores and clubs, we're investing in remodels and supply chain automation to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. Those things are going well. We'll remodel 928 stores and clubs globally over the next year, including 650 stores in the U.S. Not long ago, we shared that we would be building 30 new Sam's Clubs in the U.S. over the next several years, and more recently we announced we will add more than 150 supercenters in neighborhood markets in the U.S. over the next five years. Most of those are new builds and locations where we need a new store, but a few of them will be discount store conversions to a supercenter where we're relocating in the same community. Outside the U.S., we'll open around 230 stores and clubs next year, mainly in Mexico and Central America, and in China where they'll mostly be Sam's Clubs. We ended the year with 47 Sam's Clubs in China, and they continue to be quite strong on the top and bottom line. We are, by far, the leading membership club operator in China with 28 years of experience there. So, our physical fleet is getting stronger, and it plays a hybrid role serving customers and members when they visit, and simultaneously enabling an important portion of e-commerce. Beyond our stores and clubs, we're continuing to strengthen our first and third-party e-commerce capabilities and scale those businesses around the world. The combination of marketplace and the commissions that go with it, fulfillment services, membership, advertising, and our smaller but fast-growing data monetization business enable us to grow our bottom line faster than our top line, while delivering everyday low prices for our customers and investing in our associates at the same time. Marketplace is an engine for our business. As we've added more sellers in the U.S., we've seen more of them use our fulfillment capabilities. Marketplace is also the fastest growing aspect of e-commerce for us outside the U.S. That growth helps us drive our global ad business. For now, we see the biggest dollar impact from Walmart U.S. and in India from Flipkart. But as these businesses scale in places like Mexico and Canada, we expect to see a similar relationship. Globally, we drove advertising growth of 28% for the year to reach $3.4 billion. Our announcement today that we've agreed to acquire Vizio gives us the opportunity to reach and serve customers in new ways and connect more dots for those that advertise with us. Membership is another area where we'll continue to enhance our offerings. Walmart Plus members spend nearly twice as much with us as non-members, and they buy more over the course of a year. At Sam's Club U.S., we're rolling out new exit technology that enables our members to use Scan & Go to just walk out after completing their transaction on their phone, further enhancing their membership. Last year, we began describing ourselves as a people-led, tech-powered, omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. This description is really resonating for us inside the company. We can prioritize our associates, our values, and our culture and put impactful technology to work to help us fulfill our purpose, strengthen the customer and member experience, and strengthen our company. Here are some recent examples of us being tech powered. Our new generative AI powered search on the Walmart U.S. app, which rolled out to iOS users last month and is coming to Android users this month, is a great example. One of those popular searches this month was help me buy a Valentine's Day gift. And rather than searching separately for things like chocolates, a car, jewelry, flowers, the search returns a list of results that are relevant and curated. And Flipkart launched a similar generative AI search tool, which was available just in time for Big Billion Days. Another example is our ability to provide customers and members with more convenient and affordable delivery. We already offer express delivery in the U.S. where customers can get their orders delivered fast. But what if you need something faster? There's a pot of chili on the stove and you realize you forgot chili seasoning. Drone delivery can get it to you in 15 minutes or less. Delivering by drone isn't new to us. Over the last two years, we've operated 37 hubs across seven states, completing 20,000 deliveries. By the end of the year, we'll make it available to about 75% of households in Dallas, Fort Worth. I'm really excited about how the pieces are coming together in the near term. Our customers will have an improved store experience given our remodels. They can pick up an order, have it delivered to their doorstep or into their home, or get a fast drone delivery when they want it. And this flexibility is enabled by a more intelligent, more connected, and more automated supply chain. From scaled businesses to our faster growing newer businesses, we're well on track to continue to hit the financial targets we laid out and make important investments for the future. And while we do this, we can grow in a way that helps us achieve our goals of creating opportunities for our associates and becoming a more sustainable business. In 2017, we announced a bold ambition to work with our suppliers to reduce, avoid, or sequester one gigaton, that's 1 billion metric tons, of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We call it Project Gigaton. Our merchants and suppliers got to work and made investments in practical things like energy efficiency, packaging, redesign, and load optimization. We've reported steady progress since then, and we're excited to say that our suppliers have now reported projects exceeding that 1 billion metric ton mark six years early. We'll continue to work with our suppliers on real initiatives with real-world impacts that make our products better and our business stronger. As we think about developing our associates, we want them to feel, think, and act like owners. The degree to which our team takes ownership will have a big impact on our level of success. That's what motivated us to make shares of Walmart stock part of U.S. store manager compensation. It's also why we decided to do a three-for-one stock split. Today, more than 400,000 associates participate in our associate stock purchase plan. That's a big number, but hopefully even more will choose to participate and take advantage of the 15% the company contributes for the first $1,800 purchased by an associate each year. Psychologically, it just feels better to buy a whole share rather than a fraction. We believe in our plan, and we're looking for ways, in addition to our 401(k) and the match that goes along with it, to help our associates build wealth and do more than just earn a paycheck. I'll close by thanking our associates for delivering a great quarter to end a year where we've accomplished so much. We're out to build on our momentum. We have strong omni-channel businesses globally and they're getting stronger. We're focused on executing the plans we have for this year and beyond, which we believe will deliver top and bottom line growth within the framework we've discussed and improve ROI over time. With that, I'll turn it over to John David. John David Rainey : Thanks, Doug. We're excited about the progress we've made in growing and evolving our omni-channel platform in pursuit of our purpose to help people save money and live better. Our teams did a great job in the quarter, finishing the year strong. For the year, in constant currency, we achieved 5.6% net sales growth and over 8% adjusted operating income growth. We have strong underlying momentum exiting Q4 and are clear about the strategic initiatives we're seeing driving profitable growth in the years ahead. This is reflected in the sustained sales and operating income growth included in our FY 2025 guidance. I'll recap Q4 results using the framework we introduced at our investor community meeting last year, growth, margins, and returns. As a reminder, there's a supplemental presentation on our IR website with additional information beyond my remarks. First growth. Constant currency sales increased nearly 5% or almost $8 billion in Q4 with strong growth from all three segments, led by increased transactions across in-store, club and e-commerce channels. International sales grew 13%, reflecting strength in Flipkart, Walmex, and China. International e-commerce sales increased 44%, reaching a penetration level of 25%, which is a record high for us. This included Flipkart's largest ever Big Billion Days event with 1.4 billion customer visits over the eight-day period. In the U.S., Walmart comp sales grew 4%, reflecting increased unit volume and share gains. Like-for-like sales inflation was about 1%, moderating approximately 160 basis points from Q3 levels. We saw better than expected holiday sales, including two record-breaking volume days leading up to Christmas. Store-fulfilled delivery sales were up nearly 50% and we reached a $2 billion monthly run rate. Delivery has been a key source of share gains among upper income households and is also the most productive channel for acquiring Walmart Plus members. Sam's Club US delivered comp sales growth of 3.1% excluding fuel, with strength in food, consumables, and health categories. E-commerce sales increased 17% and we gained grocery share in both units and dollars. E-commerce continues to be a key point of differentiation for Sam\u2019s with delivery and curbside driving e-commerce growth and in-club Scan & Go penetration up over 270 basis points. Turning to margins. Enterprise gross margins expanded 39 basis points. Customers are responding as we continue to manage pricing aligned to competitive historic price gaps. In addition, we had lower markdowns resulting from strong inventory management, with Walmart U.S. inventory down 4.5%, Sam\u2019s down over 8%, and international relatively flat excluding currency. This puts us in a good position to start the new fiscal year. The timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days was a partial offset to gross margins, and while category mix pressure continued this quarter, we're encouraged to see sequential improvement versus Q3. SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis deleveraged 16 basis points, largely due to higher variable pay expenses in the U.S. relative to last year as a result of exceeding our planned performance. One of the areas I'm most pleased about is the improvement in e-commerce profitability within the Walmart U.S. segment, resulting from lower e-commerce fulfillment cost, and densifying the last mile. Our store proximity to customers is an advantage as we increasingly use stores to fulfill e-commerce orders. We've lowered last mile store to home delivery cost by about 20% in the last year, even as we've shortened delivery times to same day from around 90% of stores. Combining the fulfillment efficiencies with the improved product margins of e-commerce, we far exceeded the 200 basis point goal we outlined at our investor community meeting and lowered e-commerce losses by more than 40% versus last year's level. We also saw another strong quarter from our portfolio of higher growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni-retail model. Global advertising grew approximately 33%, led by internationals 76% growth. Internationals growth benefited from the timing of big billion days, but still delivered full year growth of about 30%. Sam's ad business achieved a new high with almost 50% more advertisers versus last year. Walmart U.S. Connect ad sales grew 22% with more than 50% growth from Marketplace sellers. We're encouraged by the strong demand from new advertisers as active advertiser counts increased over 20%. We're excited about our agreement with Vizio to bring together their unique operating system and our Walmart Connect advertising business. This combination would create new opportunities for advertisers to connect with customers, empowering brands to realize greater impact from their advertising spend with Walmart. We believe the deal would close during FY 2025. Due to certain transaction-related costs associated with the acquisition, including for talent retention and technology integration, we expect the deal to be slightly dilutive to EPS in the near term. We plan to finance the acquisition to use cash and/or debt. Importantly, we believe the transaction would be IRR accretive, delivering returns ahead of our expected ROI. Within Marketplace and Fulfillment Services, Flipkart's momentum continued with double-digit growth. In the U.S., Walmart's Marketplace delivered strong holiday events, including Black Friday, our largest marketplace sales day ever. Over the past year we've increased sellers 20% with approximately 30% of sellers using Walmart Fulfillment Services and we're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club US reached another record high level for member counts and plus member penetration, which led to membership income growth of 10%, and Walmart Plus continues to grow double digits. Strong sales and margins led to fourth quarter adjusted operating income growth of more than 13%, while adjusted EPS of $1.80 increased 5.3%. Below the line, higher interest and non-controlling interest were headwinds to adjusted EPS. Moving to returns. We generated over $35 billion in operating cash flow this year, an increase of nearly 24% due to strong business performance and improvements from working capital initiatives. Return on investment improved approximately 230 basis points to 15%, a level last achieved in 2017. Our stepped-up investments aimed at improving margins and productivity resulted in capital expenditures of $20.6 billion. The magnitude of ROI improvements reflects some benefits from productivity initiatives that we initially expected to realize in FY 2025. And as we announced this morning, we're pleased to raise the dividend by 9% this year, the largest increase in over a decade, reinforcing our commitment to strong cash returns to shareholders. And as we continue to execute on our long-range plan, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate payout ratio for our business. We have a clear vision to deliver our financial framework of growing operating income faster than sales. I'd like to spend the next couple of minutes on the initiatives we believe will drive improved incremental margins in the years ahead, even as we stay customer and top line focused, deliver value for them, and invest in our people. Beyond steady broad-based sales growth across segments, incremental profits will be derived from four key areas. Business mix, productivity benefits from our supply chain transformation and automation improvements, product mix, and geographic mix. These areas will contribute to improved e-commerce economics over the next several years. Starting with business mix. As I noted previously, we're excited about how our newer, higher-growth businesses are scaling. Together, these businesses have significantly higher structural margins than our core retail business, and they are growing significantly faster, which has the effect of bending our margin curve upward. Over the past year, global advertising grew 28% to about $3.4 billion. Walmart U.S. Marketplace revenue grew 45%, with more than 35% of orders fulfilled by Walmart Fulfillment Services. And lastly, global membership income grew 20%. Over our planning horizon, the growth of this portfolio is expected to be one of the largest drivers of operating income growing faster than sales. We believe global advertising and membership alone will represent 20% of annual operating income in FY 2025. These profit streams allow us to fund investments in our core business, while also expanding our operating margins. Turning to supply chain transformation and automation. This was a significant year for the phased deployment of automated technologies to optimize our next generation supply chain. This program spans several years with activity stepping up in FY 2025 and FY 2026. To date we've retrofitted 13 regional distribution centers with varying levels of automated storage and retrieval systems. This technology gets product to shelves faster and has meaningful benefits to productivity both in our DCs and stores. With the progress we've made over the past year we're on track toward our goal of having approximately 55% of our fulfillment center volume and roughly 65% of supercenters serviced by automation by the end of FY 2026. Already around 1,500 stores are receiving palletized freight from these DCs. There are also exciting benefits from technology being realized in our stores. We're using applications to drive speed and proficiency, including RFID and computer vision, as well as digital displays and labels to remove friction for both customers and associates. New digital tools that automate repetitive tasks or eliminate heavy lifting have increased associate productivity and customers are benefiting from improved in-stock rates and associate accessibility, leading to customer experience scores up over 140 basis points in FY 2024. We expect to begin seeing the enterprise financial benefits of upstream automation and cost to fulfill, inventory efficiency, store productivity and wage leverage as we move through FY 2025 with a more pronounced benefit in the second half. On product mix, continuing to expand our e-commerce assortment is critical to earning first-position consideration among customers. This is particularly true for general merchandise, including our marketplace. We've accelerated visit frequency and built incredible trust through core essentials like food and consumables. In fact, weekly active e-commerce customers grew 17% this last year. We're building on this trust by improving our general merchandise assortment both on and offline. General merchandise also benefits as US store remodels continue to perform well. We'll execute another 650 in Walmart U.S. in FY 2025 on top of the nearly 700 remodels completed this year. We're also excited to be returning to store growth in the US, as Doug mentioned. Our supercenter, store of the future design, is resulting in stronger four-wall sales, while also delivering a sales lift in the surrounding trade area, as these modernized stores offer more capacity for pickup and delivery, are more engaging to shop, and are improving customer perception about Walmart, especially in general merchandise, where we're encouraged by the share gains we're seeing. For general merchandise categories that surged during 2020 and 2021 and have longer replacement cycles such as electronics and housewares, we expect relative weakness to persist in FY 2025, although are hopeful to see directional improvement in the second half as comparisons ease. Lastly, geographic mix. Our international portfolio is accretive to sales and profit growth and is expected to be a larger contributor to enterprise performance. We're on pace to achieve our goals to reach approximately $200 billion in GMV and more than double profits by FY 2028 from the FY 2023 base. This implies high single digit annual sales growth for the segment. In FY 2024, international grew constant currency sales 10.6% and adjusted operating income over 15%. India, Walmex, and China are the sales growth leaders. These three markets are expected to account for approximately three-fourths of international growth over the next several years. In India, Flipkart's growth continues to compound in the double digits, while PhonePe is now processing more than 6 billion monthly transactions and has reached 1.4 trillion in annual total payment volume, about 40% higher than one year ago, and Walmex continues to go from strength to strength. Turning to guidance, relative to prior years we're introducing a slightly wider range of potential outcomes given the size of our business and a greater degree of variability we've seen. There are three nuanced factors to consider for FY 2925. First, FY 2025 is a leap year, which adds an additional day in Q1. I'll refer to this effect in our Q1 guidance shortly. Second, we'll experience a 53rd week for comp sales in Q4. We've included a slide in our presentation to help with modeling this. And third, on January 30th, we announced that the Board approved a three-for-one stock split effective February 23rd. We're offering full year and first quarter EPS guidance on a pre and post-split basis. For FY 2025, we expect net sales on a constant currency basis to grow between 3% and 4%, and for operating income to grow 4% to 6%. We expect Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. net sales growth to fall in line with the enterprise and for international growth to be above enterprise growth. We expect all three segments to contribute to operating income growth, led by Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and then Sam's US. At our Investor Day last April, we outlined a multi-year plan of growing sales approximately 4% and growing operating income even faster. We depicted that as a range of 4% to 8%. Looking at our growth over a two-year period, combining FY 2024 actuals and our guidance for FY 2025 at the midpoint suggests we will grow sales more than 5% and operating income over 8% on average annually. This is aligned with the framework we laid out, and we're pleased with how we're executing on this plan. At the enterprise level, we expect sales to grow faster than operating income in the first half due primarily to the timing of technology spent. In the second half, we expect operating income growth to exceed our sales growth. And on a full year basis, we expect operating income growth to exceed sales growth by 150 basis points at the midpoint. This spread between operating income growth and sales growth in FY 2025 is similar to what we experienced in FY 2024. Adjusted operating income grew 250 basis points faster than sales, including a benefit of approximately 90 basis points from LIFO. As we've noted in the past, this relationship of operating income growing faster than sales won't occur every quarter, but we aim for the framework to hold on an annual basis at the enterprise level. We provided additional detail on guidance for interest, tax rate, and non-controlling interest in our press release. We expect FY 2025 EPS in a range of $6.70 to $7.12 on a pre-split basis and $2.23 to $2.37 on a post-split basis. As we continue the multi-year investment in technology and innovation to optimize our supply chain and stores, we expect CapEx to range between 3% to 3.5% of sales for the next couple of years. Importantly, we have good visibility to the ROI on these investments and we're encouraged by what we're already seeing. For Q1, we expect sales growth of 4% to 5% and operating income growth of 3% to 4.5%. The leap year benefit is estimated to be approximately 100 basis points to sales growth. Operating income growth is expected to be below sales growth this quarter, reflecting the timing of technology expenses mentioned previously. We expect Q1 EPS in the range of $1.48 to $1.56 on a pre-split basis and $0.49 to $0.52 on a post-split basis. In closing, our FY 2024 results demonstrated our ability to reshape our sales and operating income growth trajectory. And our guidance for FY 2025 assumes operating income growing faster than sales again. Our value proposition is resonating with customers. We're deploying capital to proven and scalable investments in our people and platform, and our business model is evolving towards higher margins and returns. I'd like to thank our 2.1 million associates worldwide who are indeed making the difference in bringing our purpose and business strategy to life every day. We're excited that by making our stock more accessible to them, more of our associates can become owners and align their interest with our external stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question this morning is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please receive your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. My question is on the outlook for fiscal year 2025. At the outset of last year, Walmart guided to 2.5% to 3% constant currency sales growth. This year, it's guiding to 3% to 4% constant currency sales growth. Presumably, there's some benefit from the extra week and leap year within that outlook for this year. But essentially, on a full-store sales basis, you're guiding to a similar level, yet the impacts from inflation is going to be a lot more moderate this year. So what do you see that's driving this, what seems to be a bit more optimistic outlook? And as part of that, if you could comment on what would have to happen in order for you to hit the high end of your operating margin outlook, that would also be quite helpful. Thank you so much. John David Rainey : Michael, this is John David. There's a lot to that question. Let me try to unpack that a little bit. I think it's helpful to go back a year and think about the mood and the tone around the overall macro environment. At that point in time, I think there was largely a consensus that we were going to enter a recession in the last year. Fortunately, we avoided that. And so, I think overall we feel a little bit better about the health of the economy right now. That said, price levels certainly affect our forecast as well. So let me decompose our guidance just a little bit, spend a moment on this. I think there's a couple important elements to point out. One is that, overall, we expect some level of improvement in gross profit. But I want to decompose that further because there's two elements to that. One is our product margin, which we are not relying on raising prices to achieve our long range plan. So let me be very clear about that. The improvement in gross profit is mostly related to the change in our business mix. As we have these faster growing higher margin parts of our business like advertising that are contributing to an outsized part of our portfolio. So we should expect to see some improvement in gross profit. Conversely, on the SG&A line, we do expect some amount of deleverage in our business. And I want to pause on that for a second, because we recognize that EDLC is critical to being -- performing on EDLP. And so we have a lot of focus on continuing to become more efficient, to continue to try to leverage aspects of the business that we can, but our business has changed. Just as I noted in my prior comment around business mix, that affects what happens in SG&A. As we rely on things like advertising, some of the expenses related to that hit the SG&A line. And so, our focus as a team is on growing operating income. And you see that in our guidance. I'll also point out that while mix, and I should say product mix, has been a headwind over the last two years, we do assume some amount of headwind going into the coming year as general merchandise is -- will be less of our business relative to food. So there is some persistent tell to that. In terms of what would have to happen to -- for us to hit the top end of our guidance, I think a couple things. And we're most focused on what we can control, and that's the team executing on our plan. So that's our focus, but we're not immune to the whims of the economy. And certainly there are economic outcomes that could cause us to move to the high end of the range or the low end of the range. But given where we are right now, going into the first part of this year, we feel really good about the plan. We feel really good about the way that the team is executing and the way that we're serving our customers. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Krisztina Katai : Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. So similarly, I wanted to start with gross margin, right? It was very strong in the quarter, up nearly 40 basis points for the enterprise. So I'm wondering if you could quantify maybe the biggest drivers behind the improvement to look at higher margin services for total retail and how that gives you sort of confidence in the back half of the year for fiscal 2025? And then John David, you talked about the improvements in digital contribution margin, certainly the drivers behind that. I was wondering if you could quantify it or maybe speak to the magnitude of improvement we've seen and sort of where that puts you on that path to greater -- even profitability. Thank you. John David Rainey : Sure. I'll start on the answer to the improvement of gross margin. John may want to jump in there, but we're just in a healthier place than we were a year ago. And I think inventory is a big part of that. As we noted, inventory in the U.S. was down 4.5%, down 8% for Sam\u2019s. And that just enables us to operate a lot more effectively. We saw markdowns in the quarter be notably less than they were the year before, and all those have an effect on gross margin. John, do you want to talk a little bit more about that, and I'll go back to e-com? John Furner : Yes, Thanks, John David. Krisztina, thanks for the question. A few things that I'd say on margin. Number one, the team is really committed to driving value for customers, and they did that in the quarter while improving margin. And I want to talk about value just a second. We're really proud about the fact that our rollback count is up significantly from a year ago, similar to what it was in the third quarter. Second, the value with customers is resonating well. We saw NPS levels at a high level throughout the quarter and all-time highs for the quarter, which we're also proud of. And then on the gross margin line as it relates to the overall flow through, there are two things to consider there. One is, sell-through was very strong throughout the quarter. Inventory closed down 4.5%. This is the first year I can remember in my career being in stores in early December. And they were out of storage containers, product on the counter in the back rooms. The teams did a very nice job getting inventory inside, knowing what they owned, and selling through. And the sell-through that was strong at the holiday events, we mentioned two of our strongest days ever were in December, just leading up to Christmas. The strong sell-through led to lower markdowns, and the markdowns were by far the biggest impact on margins in the U.S. And then the second impact would have been from business mix. So John David said that earlier, but those are the two factors that improved it. And we feel good about our inventory position as we begin this year. We ended the year clean. Store managers and associates have back rooms that are quite under control. They feel very good about their inventory levels and we're really proud of how they performed. John David Rainey : Sure, and Krisztina, I'll address the improvement that we've seen and expect to continue to see in our contribution margin on e-commerce. There's a couple elements to this. One is, I'm really pleased with the way the team has performed on cost of fulfillment. That has gone down 20% in the last year. A lot of hard work has gone into making that happen. But the unit economics of delivering a package to a customer or a member have simply improved. So that's a big part of the improvement we've seen. And we expect to see continued improvements there. Second aspect of this is the densification of our network, specifically the last mile. As we have more customers coming to us, using us through e-commerce channels, it enables us to spread that cost of delivery over multiple customers. And so if you think about an item like our weekly active customers on e-commerce, that's up 17%, much more than our top line. So customers are recognizing that they can come to Walmart for convenience just as much as they can on price, and that actually helps the profitability of this channel for us. In terms of where we or when we can get to profitability, we have line of sight to e-commerce being breakeven when we include all the various components of this, advertising, fulfillment services, all that together. But to be clear, we're focused on getting to e-commerce profitability even without the subsidization of those additional items. That's a little further down the road. We have a lot of work to do to get to that point, but we're really pleased with the progress that we've made and the plan that we have going forward. Doug McMillon : I think big picture, as it relates to the business model scale has helped a lot. Getting to $100 billion for the year is a different number than what we were dealing with before, and it's nice to have growth coming on top of that. And as John David said, the formula, whether it's in the US or it's in other markets around the world, is now clear to us. We're in execution mode as it relates to these things. And obviously, route density helps, volume helps, mix. As it relates to contribution, profit is part of the equation. And it's exciting to see whether [indiscernible] Walmex or it's what's happening in India in addition to what we've been talking about in the U.S. with Walmart and Sam's, the commonalities that we're now experiencing. It feels like for some time now we've really kind of known what we're doing and omni is an advantage, figuring out how to leverage stores and clubs, what role they play has been part of that journey as well. Kathryn McLay : And if I can just comment on China. If you look at their progress over the last few years, they had a digital penetration of about 4% in 2019. They're now at 48%. It's almost 50-50 offline and online and we're driving our profit through that business. So I think they've shown a path to really growing omni-sales profitably. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Hi, good morning everyone. Doug, I was going to ask you to kind of keep it high level. For fiscal 2024, the prior year, it was a tough consumer year, but strategically Walmart made progress on a lot of fronts. If you look at fiscal 2025, can you boil down the year one to three measures of success? And I have some ideas, but I won't preload the question. And then what will define success in terms of strategic initiatives? And then just secondarily any evolving thoughts about reinvestments in the business, so the business should continue to see higher EBIT growth over the next several years. Do you -- since you have one year or at least a couple years under your belt now of seeing that evolve, do you find that the reinvestment rate should be any greater such that not all of that flows through? Doug McMillon : Thanks, Simeon. I feel good about the reinvestment rate. If you look at what our plans include, whether it's on the OpEx or CapEx side, I think we're being aggressive. And it is exciting to be in a position where we can play offense on price to the degree we need to. We can invest in associate wages and at the same time we can grow operating income faster than sales. I'm going to look back at last year and then how that plays through FY 2025. I think that themes are the same. We got to keep the top line going. And this business has always been so fun as it relates to just being a merchant driving sales. And I like the fact that we've got an opportunity across so many categories, food, consumables, general merchandise, apparel. And as prices come down on the general merchandise side, there's an opportunity to show off our merchant skills and to drive more units. And that's one of the reasons why, to Michael's question, to start this conversation, we have some confidence, is because we're seeing our units move and our share numbers look strong. So top line is a focus. I think we're positioned to grow that because we can do that in-store club, pick up delivery, however people want to be served. The second thing I'd mention is the automation plan. And I think in the U.S. where we're most aggressive, we'll see over the next few years a higher level of inventory accuracy, improved flow, which will help us with markdowns, associate wage productivity, all the metrics that we've been talking about with you guys, in particular for the last year. So I think automation is the next theme. And then the last one that I'll mention is, all of the things that flow from Marketplace and advertising. I think we've learned a lot about marketplace over the last few years, and we're working together to build what is a multi-country marketplace business, which will help us not only with commissions related to marketplace and Fulfillment Service scale, but it'll also help us with advertising and data monetization and some of the other keys to changing the shape of the P&L, or the business mix as we refer to it. So those are the things that come to the top for me and that's what I stay focused on. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just want to go back to the Walmart U.S. general merchandise category. Just curious how the remodels have continued to perform, as I believe you'll soon be lapping the Teterboro opening? And then as you look at the general merchandise offering, curious if you're seeing any re-insured. Just trying to get a sense of when we can start to expect a return to positive growth? Thank you. John David Rainey : Hey, Rupesh. Good morning. It\u2019s John. Really pleased with the team. They're growing top and bottom line, and we're investing in the future, as we talked about. This year we're planning to do 650 more remodels. We did close to 700 last year, which is I think our largest year, and had a really big month in the month of November. The results are very promising. As you know, there is more space for customers. We opened the store up. We're really proud of the results in apparel, in home, beauty. We see positive signs out of the pet department. There are a number of things that are coming together. In the fourth quarter, in particular, we're really pleased with the toy performance, where we saw unit share gains with big brands like Lego, Mattel, Muffin Dugs. So there's some really nice signs coming out of those stores. And we're really looking forward to this year to put another, as we said, 650 remodels out in the market. Doug McMillon : And you've consistently performed seasonally. I think as we look forward to this year, whether it's Easter, back to school, all the way through to holiday again, people come to Walmart for seasonal purchases and we've got a great strength there that we plan to build on. John David Rainey : We do, Doug. It's been a lot of fun to see how these came together. As I mentioned, the sell-throughs are really strong throughout the fourth quarter. And Valentine's Day was a strong holiday early in the year. Because we're so close to customers, we were delivering same day up until 8 :30 that night. I wouldn't recommend that for everyone, but certainly the capability to be able to take flowers to someone at 8 :30 who had a bit of a moment was a lot of fun. Save the day. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to just talk a little bit more about advertising, 28% growth for the year. I think you said reaching $3.4 billion. Just doing some math here, it seems like that could be adding about $300 million to $400 million in EBIT on an annual basis. Now, just wanted to see if that's in the right ballpark and what kind of magnitude of growth you're forecasting for this coming year and really the next couple of years? And also if you can just elaborate here on the vision with Vizio as it relates to advertising. John David Rainey : Sure, Kelly. This is John David, I'll start. We're really pleased with not just advertising, but a lot of these faster growth parts of our business. Advertising, we've called out. You noted the growth that we had for the year. We have really strong growth in the quarter. You're right, your math is right in terms of the type of contribution that we could expect there. And that segues into the conversation around Vizio. We're really excited about that acquisition. I think it's very complementary to what we're already doing organically in that part of the business, and this is an accelerant. I'll turn it to Doug and John, though, to add more about that. Doug McMillon : Yes, we're not going to say too much. Obviously, we need to give that some time for the process to play out. But as John David said, we are really excited about the opportunity to bring together Vizio's operating system with our ad platform. And we can appreciate that you all would probably have a number of questions about it. Marketplace and advertising are key drivers of profitability growth, as we've already discussed. And this acquisition accelerates the buildout of our advertising platform into the connected TV business, which will be exciting. But given that the acquisition hasn't closed, we can only reinforce what we've already shared. So we'll be limited in our remarks today. So you may want to save your questions for another topic. We want to focus for now on our quarter on the company's strategy and more broader topics and then we can come back to you once the deal is closed. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robbie Ohms with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Robert Ohmes : Hey, thanks for taking my question. My question is on the transaction comps. I think it was 4.3% for Walmart U.S. That's a pretty strong number in a big quarter for you guys. A couple things on that. Can you talk about how that kind of played out in terms of the fourth quarter? Was it more grocery driven and e-commerce driven in grocery, or did you have really strong transaction growth year-over-year in holiday? And then in the guidance you guys have given for Walmart U.S., how should we think about that transaction momentum continuing? And then also, probably the biggest drivers that's sustaining that kind of high level of transaction growth for this year. John Furner : Hey Robbie, it's John. Let me start on this and others can jump in. The 4.3% is encouraging, we're seeing more customers, we're seeing them more often, we're seeing a lot of new customers. The frequency, John David mentioned earlier, weekly average customers in the e-commerce up 17% is a strong number. The mix hasn't changed really all that much. I think if you look at our results by business unit from consumables to food to GM, pretty similar trends than what we've been seeing. I think the big difference that we can talk about is, is we see more customers using same-day services and express deliveries, and that's also across a broad range of categories. That would be intuitive to assume it's food at times like the example earlier when you're missing an ingredient. But we're also seeing this happen for birthday gifts and general merchandise items and other things. So, I\u2019d go back to what we talked about at the beginning of last year when we talked about supply chain strategy, having a short last mile is an important component in e-commerce and having stores be able to deliver what historically would have been an e-commerce order or a food delivery order or the combination of the two is really helping the brand. And additionally, that's bringing the delivery costs down, which has contributed to the improvement in operations loss in e-commerce. Doug McMillon : I think the things you've done to make it easier to pick at store level should be mentioned too, RFID and apparel. Having inventory levels down so that people can find things. I think it helped us a lot when it came time to pick toys at the last minute, for example. Our accuracy, -- our customer scores reflect that improved accuracy. Combine that with the automation that we're putting into e-commerce fulfillment centers and you can start to see that there's a great opportunity for us to leverage math and optimize where things come from, but our accuracy is also improving. John Furner : It really has, Doug. There are a few things that we're doing with technology to help us ensure that we know what we own, where it is, and ensure that it's accessible for the store associates. And I can't overemphasize the importance of inventory levels being down 4.5% and what that does for a store manager, a team lead, for the coaches that are in the stores who need to take care of what a customer needs right now and they're able to do that much more accurately. So I think it'll get better over time as the automation continues to come online, but definitely some notable improvements from the store team this quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Corey Tarlowe : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to double click on technology and talk about Walmart being a people-led and tech-powered company, but specifically as it relates to AI, what is it in the last 12 months that you've deployed enterprise-wide that's worked well for the business and helped drive better returns? And then what is it over the next 12 months that you see that could really help to improve results even more going forward? As I know that that's been a continued focus for the enterprise broadly. Thank you. Doug McMillon : Yes. Thanks, Corey. This is Doug, and others can chime in here and help me with this, but we're very excited about generative AI. There are big opportunities for us to improve the customer and member experience, improve associate experiences and productivity, and help take costs out of business, and we're moving. I think big picture, we've got a very clear plan as it relates to what we want to build versus what we want to leverage from others and we've got good partnerships and good advisors and we've got a strong tech team that knows what they're doing in this area. So I do expect that it'll have benefits. As I talk to other CEOs and we learn here, I think it's still too early to try and quantify this specifically. I think as we look back on what develops, we can probably tell you in the rear view mirror how things played out from a cost perspective, for example. But the thing we're most excited about that's already happened is the way search has improved. The way generative AI helped us really improve a solution-oriented search experience for customers and members is the thing that we're most excited about and it happened pretty quickly and it impacted Super Bowl search results. We gave you an example of Valentine's Day earlier and the team is learning how to do that across all of our markets and the entirety of the company. So that's also exciting. We also rolled out something we call My Assistant on our Me@Walmart applications so that all of our associates have access to generative AI tools and capabilities. So strategically, the way I think about it is, the leadership of the companies working through where our biggest opportunities are, prioritizing and resourcing those opportunities. But we're also making generative AI available broadly so that we get surprising good news from the way that all of our associates interact with it. Anybody else want to comment on that technology? Chris Nicholas : For Sam's Club we were really excited to unveil at [CES] (ph) the first of our Sam's Club's big consumer facing applications of AI. So our easy exit process, which employs computer vision and AI to allow people to just walk out, is just a really exciting way. And when you watch customers, I was in a club last week watching customers just walk out, members just walk out. And the joy that it gives them, there is some computer vision and AI is making their lives better without them knowing why or how is really exciting. And I think it's just the beginning of a journey in Sam's Club. We like to innovate. We have the opportunity to innovate. And we'll see opportunities for cost out, no doubt. We took 35 million tasks out of the club last year for associates by employing technology. A lot of that is artificial intelligence that helps them manage inventory better. And we're working a lot with our members, too, on personalizing how we interact with them. So we replete with opportunities, and I think the important thing is to choose the biggest ones and invest in those. Doug McMillon : That exit technology still requires a member to scan their items on their app. So Scan & Go is the first step and then you can just leave the building when the transaction is completed. But obviously, eventually we want to remove all of that as part of the process, too. Chris Nicholas : We do. Doug McMillon : Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks, guys. You mentioned rollbacks being up versus last year. Can you quantify that and maybe talk about what percent of those rollbacks are being vendor-funded? How that compares to last year as well? And how that might have also compared to how you operate rollbacks historically? Also I'm curious in which categories you're most focused on providing those rollbacks? Thanks. John Furner : Hey, Paul. It's John. I'll take that question. This rollback [indiscernible] one of the programs [indiscernible] Walmart format. It's up around 50% on last year, which is similar to what we reported in the third quarter. As far as categories, it's pretty evenly spread across the box. If you go back to what we said earlier about pricing, general merchandise is negative by low single digits. So you'll see a decent number all across general merchandise. The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well. It's a really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread back to a dollar, which had been a dollar for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year. So customers immediately responded. Rotisserie Chicken is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding. And as John Davis said earlier, customers are being choiceful. And our customers are smart. And they recognize value really well. So as prices come down and we can show the value digitally or physically, we're seeing a lot of great responses. As far as the funding, I mean, it's always going to be balanced. Merchants have a lot of levers in their P&L from their initial margin to how they manage their inventory back to mix. In many cases, you can improve margin by selling items that are higher margin. You can take higher margin items down and move sales to those items, and it shifts the entire mix to the category. So it's not as easy as just one simple answer, but the merchants are, as I said earlier, they're doing a nice job of managing value for customers. They are driving rollbacks and because of strong inventory management, we were able to save markdowns and improve gross margin on product. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Seth Sigman : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just reflecting on the market share gains, a lot of the commentary this past year has been focused on wins with the higher income consumer. Just any more perspective on how that's been playing out within consumables versus discretionary categories? And how you think about getting that customer really up that spending curve over time. And I guess just related, if you could speak to market share trends, perhaps across some of the other customer segments as well, that would be helpful. Thank you. John David Rainey : Seth, this is John David. We're pleased with what we've seen in market share gains. In the quarter, we gained share in virtually every category. But notably, one of the biggest contributors in the quarter was in this income demographic from households that make more than $100,000 a year. For general merchandise, as an example, two-thirds of the share gain that we had in the quarter was through this income demographic and digital channels. And what that illustrates, I think, broadly, is that our value for convenience is every bit as much -- every grade is what it is for price. And that resonates to people regardless of the size of your paycheck. And so that's one of the reasons we think that we're gaining share, our value proposition is resonating with customers and they're clearly shopping us in new ways versus how they have historically. Kathryn McLay : I'd also just comment on some of the other markets that we're into looking at the market share gains that we've got really closely correlate with the improvements we've seen in MPS as well as price gap. So I think as we look at just being really relevant from a value perspective in markets we're seeing that the consumer is responding with improvements in traffic and also in market share. Doug McMillon : There's so many things Seth in there, but what customers want, they want a great price, they want a great environment, they want value and they want experience. And we've been talking about for a couple of years the flexibility that we can offer that we couldn't or did not years ago. And the stores are a very important part of the e-commerce solution, including delivery, but also picking and at times just being exactly what they are which are great stores that offer those four elements. So remaining flexible can be really important in saving people time. John David mentioned convenience and that is definitely a driver of the results. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Thanks for joining us today. I'm a little concerned that I'm going to be boring in my closing remarks, because we're becoming quite repetitive. We're in execution mode and the headlines are, we believe we can grow, we're confident in our ability to grow because we're positioned to serve customers and members however they want to be served. We can provide value and we can provide convenience. And underneath the supply chain's changing to be more intelligent, more connected, more automated. And that's just going to help us improve execution. From a profit point of view, we can grow profit faster than sales, while investing in our associates, while investing in our business, and having flexibility on price if we need it. And we'll do that through the combination of business mix, the productivity delivered by automation. We're in a great set of countries. We can sell food. We can sell general merchandise, whatever the customer wants in the moment. And then thirdly, we can grow ROI over time. I think we're investing in the right categories. We're very clear on the places where we're investing. We know what the expected returns are there. It's great to see the automation plans continuing to scale. We're in a period of time here over the next few years where that's going to be vital, but it doesn't last forever and there's a transition on the other side and it looks quite exciting to us. So I think the combination of growth, profit growing faster than sales and ROI look attractive here and we'll just keep trying to get better as we execute it. Thanks again for your time. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin. Steph Wissink : Welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Walmart. Joining me today from our home office in Bentonville are Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon, and CFO, John David Rainey. Doug and John David will first share their views on the quarter and then we'll open the line to your questions. During the Q&A portion, we will be joined by our segment CEOs, John Furner from Walmart U.S.; Kath McLay from Walmart International; and Chris Nicholas from Sam's Club. For additional detail on our results, including highlights by segment, please see our earnings release and accompanying presentation on our website. We will make every effort to answer as many questions as we can in the hour we have scheduled for this call. As a courtesy, please limit yourself to one question. Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor Statement and Non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, that wraps my intro. We're ready to begin. Doug McMillon : Good morning and thanks for joining us. Our team delivered a great quarter to start the year. Our results were stronger than we anticipated with sales growth of 5.7% and adjusted operating profit, up 12.9% in constant currency. All three operating segments performed well. The momentum we see across the businesses driven by growth in units sold and transaction counts, as well as market share gains, including general merchandise. These are not inflation-driven results. In the U.S., like-for-like sales inflation was about 40 basis points for the quarter, including mid-single-digit deflation in general merchandise and low-single-digit inflation in food and consumables. Together with our suppliers, we're making progress lowering prices. Our rollback count is up and customers are responding to our price leadership. The first highlight I'd like to call out is the improvement in customer experience scores. That has a lot to do with our associates. I get to visit with a lot of them as I travel. This quarter I've been in stores and clubs in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Toronto, Nashville, Los Angeles, Austin, Oklahoma City, and Dallas. And before we get too far into the conversation about our performance, I want to thank all our associates everywhere. They deserve all the credit. They're managing the things we've always managed, while simultaneously building new capabilities and driving change. Here's what they're doing to drive our business. First, we're providing value. Low prices on quality merchandise are always important to our customers and members. Our combination of everyday low prices plus a large number of rollbacks is resonating. During the holiday, we offered a basket of Easter items with a lower price than a year ago in the U.S. and Canada. Customers responded, and we saw strong sell-throughs. Our merchants are doing a great job, including managing inventory, where we finished down 2.7% globally. Second, we have the selection people are looking for. In the U.S., the number of marketplace sellers grew by 36% for the quarter with a skew count now sitting at more than $420 million. In Mexico, the number of marketplace sellers grew by more than 50% with skew count up nearly 80%. More often, our customers are finding what they're looking for when they shop our app or site. eCommerce penetration is up in all our markets. Third, we're improving the experience of shopping with us. Our store remodels look good and are performing well. Plus our curbside pickup and delivery capabilities are improving as indicated by our customer experience metrics. Globally, we completed nearly 70 remodels during the quarter, and we're on track to do more than 900 this year. We're making it more convenient to shop with us, and our customers and members are rewarding us with growth as we save them time. We expect to continue to earn healthy levels of sales growth and simultaneously grow profit faster than sales this year, while managing our price gaps and investing in our associates at the same time. This quarter's results were driven by a combination of strong core performance and the growth of our newer businesses. As it relates to the core, strong same-store sales growth combined with good inventory management resulted in strong profit flow through. And our newer businesses, advertising and membership were both up 24%. Today we announced that we're expanding our data analytics and insights product, Walmart Luminate, into Mexico and Canada. Our technology team continues to deliver the innovation that helps us drive our business. We're bringing new experiences to life, like generative AI driven product search that helps our customers shop more intuitively. The team continues to build and improve the platforms for marketplace and data that we're using across countries. And they're building and improving the operating system that enables us to create a more intelligent, flexible, and automated supply chain. The implementation of our automated storage and retrieval systems and our DCs and FCs is on track. And we're as enthusiastic about the impact of that work as we've ever been. Turning to our segments, in Walmart U.S., we recently announced a new private brand and food called Better Goods. It's our largest food private brand release in 20-years. The brand focuses on today's trends and premium quality. But at the same time 70% of Better Goods items are priced under $5. This is the type of quality and value that will resonate with customers across income spectrums. We also introduced on-demand early morning delivery to customer doorsteps as early as 7 a.m. and as quickly as 30 minutes. Globally, same-day delivery is available from more than 6,500 locations. In Walmart U.S., over the last 12 months, 4.4 billion items were delivered same or next day, with about 20% of those delivered in under three hours. Delivery times are getting faster, and the cost of delivery is coming down at the same time. During the quarter, we made the necessary but difficult decision to close our U.S. health care clinics. There were a number of aspects that were going well, and we really want to be part of the solution to improving healthcare in this country. But the reality is that given reimbursement rates and costs to serve, we could no longer see a path to achieving an acceptable level of profitability. And we're committed to being disciplined with our investments. We're grateful to our associates that worked in this area. They did their part. We'll continue to build our pharmacy and optical businesses, and we'll find ways for our pharmacists to help as they've done with immunizations and vaccinations. Earlier this week, we also shared decisions to eliminate some home office roles and reduce the amount of remote work. The vast majority of our home office associates have been back together in offices since we came back from the pandemic, and we want to see even more of that. Being in person is important. Our culture is stronger when we're together. We make decisions faster, we're more creative, and we help develop the next generation of talent. We'll continue to make changes to ensure we're best positioned to serve customers and support our store, club, and supply chain associates. Moving to Walmart International, we continue to deliver strong results with double-digit growth in sales and profit, lifting our company growth rates. Strength was broad-based, led by Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Results for the quarter included strong growth in e-commerce, led by store-fulfilled orders and marketplace. We saw improved sales growth in general merchandise categories as we focused on celebrations across the world like Chinese New Year, Easter, and Walmart Canada's 30th anniversary. Like the U.S., the international team is improving speed of delivery across markets. Same day delivery orders in India grew by over 150% in the quarter and is now available across 20 major cities. One-hour delivery in China grew to 55 million orders as customers sought convenience during Chinese New Year. And in Chile, 60% of e-commerce orders are delivered same day. With Sam's Club U.S., it's exciting to see how the team is using Computer Vision to make it faster for members using Scan and Go to leave the building once they're done shopping. I'm referring to the Computer Vision and AI powered exit technology that allows members to leave the club without having to stand in line to get the receipt check that we announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Since then, we've deployed it in about 20% of our clubs and we're on track to have it in all U.S. clubs by year end. In addition to this being better for members, the technology identifies more items than we could with our previous process. This is a great example of people led tech powered solving for technology that benefits the member experience. It was a strong start to the year. We'll remain focused on improving customer and member experiences, being great merchants, building our newer businesses, and improving returns. With that, I'll hand it to John David to share more about the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. John David Rainey : Thanks, Doug. Our strong results this quarter clearly demonstrate our ability to deliver on our financial framework of growing operating income faster than sales. This quarter's results reflect strong execution from the team across virtually every aspect of our business, share gains in improving MPS scores from our members and customers that are increasingly looking for value and convenience and the power of our Omni Retail model. I'll discuss our quarterly results using our framework of growth, margins, and returns. We experienced ongoing sales strength with all three operating segments outperforming our expectations. We're growing traffic and units, and our inventories are in excellent shape. We're on a multi-year journey to reshape our profit profile and operating income growth trajectory. And this quarter reflects the benefits of improved margins in our core retail operations, as well as contributions from business mix. We're investing in areas that have strong capital returns like automation, store remodels, and digital tools and technologies. Combined, these investments are widening our competitive advantages, providing us levers to also invest in people and price, while achieving our sales and margin objectives. Before I provide more color behind the strength of our financial results, I want to remind you that there is a supplemental presentation on our IR website with additional information beyond my remarks. First quarter total net sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis, ahead of our guidance of 4% to 5% growth. As a reminder, the leap year this year contributes approximately 1 point to our year-over-year sales growth. International led the enterprise with constant currency sales growth of 10.7%, reflecting strength in Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Across markets, seasonal events were strong and were encouraged by early improvements in general merchandise sales. International e-commerce sales were up 19% as we continue to expand our capabilities. In Canada, the majority of our marketplace growth came from items serviced by Walmart fulfillment services. And in India, Flipkart same-day delivery became available to millions more customers as they expanded the offering to 20 cities. Walmart U.S. also delivered better than expected growth with comp sales up 3.8%, including strong e-commerce growth of 22%, led by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery, marketplace, and advertising. Traffic and sales growth were strong across both stores and digital channels and were pleased with the unit growth. We're seeing higher engagement across income cohorts with upper income households continuing to account for the majority of the share gates. Sam's U.S. comp sales, ex. Fuel, were also strong at 4.4%. The Sam's team continues to make progress on quality and value with Member's Mark, our private brand. The team is doing a great job of being on top of product trends with the brand. Member's Mark drove high-single-digit growth in Q1, and is a growing reason why members join and renew alongside digitally enabled solutions such as Scan and Go and Curbside Pickup. Next to sales, gross profit growth was the key driver of upside in Q1. Consolidated gross margin expanded 42 basis points, led by Walmart U.S. Across segments, we benefited from lower markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management and favorable business mix, enabling strong margin flow through from sales. Consolidated adjusted operating income grew 12.9% in constant currency, more than 700 basis points higher than our sales growth. This reflects better-than-expected sales growth and higher gross margins and membership income. This was partially offset by expense deleverage in our U.S. segments related to higher variable pay expenses from our app performance. Walmart U.S. was the primary driver of app performance, but all segments contributed to operating income growing faster than sales. Taking a closer look at margins, as we continue to work closely with our suppliers to lower cost, we're managing our Walmart U.S. pricing aligned to competitive price gaps, and customers are responding favorably, resulting in sustained sales growth and higher gross margins. Our price gaps through the retail market remain strong. Improved inventory management and favorable business mix allowed us to optimize our pricing on everyday essentials and we're investing further in value within our private brands. Our rollback program is driving customer engagement and supporting our volume growth, with grocery rollback counts up 45% year-over-year in April. Carrying forward the success we saw last year in our seasonal programs, we're using celebrations and festive events to reinforce our value proposition and customers are responding. Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, and Easter drove stronger sales across categories, including general merchandise. We're also working with suppliers to bring innovation to U.S. customers, while leaning into our own private brands as sources of value, quality, and newness. As a result, we've continued to see strong momentum in private brand sales with grocery penetration at 30 basis points in Q1. While private brand penetration is in the low-20s as a percent of sales, more than half of all customer grocery baskets over the last year have had a private brand in them. Our inventory levels continue to come down, with Walmart U.S. declining about 4% and Sam\u2019s down nearly 5% at quarter end, while we sustain strong sales and healthy in stock rates. Having the right inventory in the right categories in the right places has allowed us to not only minimize markdown activity, but also support higher in stock levels with goods flowing more smoothly through distribution centers into stores. Importantly, the business is realizing efficiencies, while both customer and associate MPS scores are rising. Global e-commerce growth was 21% in Q1 and e-commerce losses continue to narrow, most notably in the U.S. net delivery cost per order, improving nearly 40%. More customers are shopping with us, more often across more categories, moving us along the pathway of delivery density and transaction margins that give us clear visibility into profitability in this channel over time. Many consumer pocketbooks are still stretched, and we see the effect of that in our business mix, as they're spending more of their paychecks on non-discretionary categories and less on general merchandise. This merchandise mix remains a headwind to margins, but it's consistent with our expectations. Our Walmart U.S. team is executing strategies to improve general merchandise sales and to increase the visibility of our growing e-commerce brand assortments in fashion, home, and electronics. We have the opportunity to grow general merchandise sales in stores with our first-party e-commerce assortment and especially with our marketplace. We were encouraged to see share gains in fashion, home, and hard lines in Q1. In addition, marketplace sales in categories such as furniture, sporting goods, kids' apparel, and home grew more than 20%. In addition to sales growth and gross margin improvement, the reshaping of our profit composition is an exciting part of our strategy. We're enhancing capabilities in higher margin growth drivers, such as advertising, membership, marketplace and fulfillment, and data analytics and insights, and seeing the corresponding improvement in our business mix. Global advertising grew 24%, led by 26% growth from Walmart Connect in the U.S., and International's 27% growth. Walmart's U.S. ad sales reflected more than 50% growth from marketplace sellers, while overall active advertiser counts increased nearly 19%. Sam's ad business now has 30% more active advertisers versus last year. We're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club U.S. reached another record high level for member counts and plus member penetration, resulting in membership income growth over 13%. Sam's China member count grew 25% with increasing active and renewal rates. In addition, Walmart Plus continued to grow double-digits as members engage with us more frequently and spend more than other customers. For marketplace, within international, all markets grew double-digits, led by Flipkart and Walmex, reflecting the strength we're experiencing across markets. In the U.S., Walmart's marketplace delivered strong results, aided by 36% more sellers on our platform, with 28% of sellers using our marketplace fulfillment services. To give you an example of the benefit of our Omni model, in April, we launched a new service enabling customers to order from an extended assortment of nearly 40,000 tires on our marketplace and have them installed at one of our 2,300 Auto Care centers and stores in the U.S. It's a great example of how we're leveraging our unique Omni capabilities to remove friction for customers. Within data analytics and insights, Walmart data ventures continues to see strong demand from clients for their insights on consumer behavior and trends and our Omni channel operations. In Q1, this business doubled versus last year. In April, we announced a new self-serve integration to make it easier for supplier advertisers to combine Walmart Luminate's insights with Walmart Connect's closed-loop, omni-channel retail media solutions to help drive product, brand, and category sales. This is the first time we're bringing these two solutions together, creating greater cohesion between both offerings and helping suppliers deliver more relevant shopping experiences for our customers. Beyond executing on our operating strategies, you're also seeing a discipline from us to address areas of our business that have not performed as well. You should expect this discipline to continue concentrating our efforts in capital on clear drivers of incremental value. This requires us to be bold enough to step back from areas that at one time were clear opportunities or were strategically or financially accretive, but now have diminishing value. It was through this lens that we made the decision to close all 51 Walmart Health Centers, as Doug mentioned. Total business reorganization cost resulted in a charge of $0.02 per share in the first quarter. Wrapping up Q1 results, below the line items reflected slightly higher interest expense on relatively flat net debt balances and a lower tax rate year-over-year based on changes in the fair value of our equity investments. Adjusted EPS of $0.60 per share, compared favorably to our guidance of $0.49 to $0.52. Turning to guidance. Our team is executing at a very high level. Q1 results exceeded our expectations for both sales and operating income growth. And while it might be a little much to expect every quarter to be this good, we feel really good about the performance and it demonstrates how this business can perform when we're firing on all cylinders. Consumer economic conditions have been relatively consistent since the start of the year. Many of the value-seeking behaviors we witnessed last year have continued, particularly around seasonal events. Our focus on providing customers with value and convenience is resonating, and we're gaining share. That said, we're one quarter into a year that still has some degree of uncertainty and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We currently expect Q2 sales to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% and for operating income growth in line with that at roughly 3% to 4.5%. EPS is expected to be between $0.62 and $0.65 per share. In Q2, we expect operating income growth to be impacted by timing of tech and wage investments. Combining Q1 results with the midpoint of our Q2 guidance would suggest first-half sales would grow nearly 5% and operating income would grow about 8%. We feel really good about our start to the year, and our outlook for the second-half is consistent with 90-days ago. Our Q1 results and the midpoint of our 2Q guidance suggest that we should be at the high-end or even slightly above our sales and operating income guidance for the year. We'll revisit our full-year guidance as we exit Q2. This is more aligned with our historic cadence of updates and consistent with the philosophy we have as a management team to recognize early momentum, but to also maintain prudence early in the year given the macro uncertainty and so much of the year is still ahead of us. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our results this quarter. They demonstrate what our team is capable of when we're laser focused on the member and customer, disciplined on cost, and leveraging the technology investments we've made. Profits are growing, customer NPS scores are increasing, and we're running a great operation. We like our position, we like who we are, and we like where we're going. We appreciate your interest in Walmart, and are now ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Kate McShane : Good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk a little bit more about what you saw with the lower end consumer throughout the quarter? And how you think about their contribution to comp for the rest of the year, especially when it comes to general merchandise? John Furner : Hey, Kate. It's John Furner. Good morning. I'll start. Well, first, just like to say thanks to the entire team for what they did in the quarter and the execution. It's great to see so many of our associates making such a difference. And it's also been encouraging to see our store managers really focus on in-store merchandising in the quarter. We saw big improvements all across the U.S. and that's -- that was really exciting. In terms of the consumer, it's been pretty consistent, I think is the best word we would use. Consistent spending across income groups. We've had more growth as we mentioned in the earlier remarks, on the high-end consumer. That remains true. We're very focused on value, flexibility, and convenience, and that's working across income segments. It's great to be in a position where we have store conditions that we're proud of with growth. It's great to be in a position where our pickup business is growing and then as we mentioned our delivery business has now exceeded our pickup business in size and the run rate remains strong. So I think what we can say at this point is things have been consistent. What is also helping us is on our food categories, well broadly across the store, we have almost 7,000 rollbacks. That's really helping that in our food categories, we see an even larger spread between eating at home, preparing meals at home and eating out, which we think can help Walmart over the remainder of the year. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. I have one question. I'll make it in two parts. First, to diagnose the consumer, not raising yet. It sounds like you sort of want to, but there is something holding you back besides it is early in the year, but curious if there's anything on the consumer side? And then the second part of this is how Doug has talked about doing both investing and then driving value today. And curious in this environment, if you have the flexibility and even the desire to lean in even more, it looks like it could be a choppy year. So ability to continue to drive the do both driving these impressive share gain, profit margin expansion while continuing to invest in the value proposition? Thanks. John David Rainey : I'll start with the first part of the question, Simeon, and then hand it over to Doug for the second piece. On guidance, there's nothing to read into that. First, like we feel really good about the performance in the first quarter. These are strong results across the board. We think it's prudent to be patient on this performance and as we noted we'd update at the end of the second quarter. I think we'd all agree that we're in far from a certain environment around the consumer. It's you know the health of the consumer is something we read about every single day. And given that we're one quarter into the year, we just want to be patient on this. But that should not take away from our conviction and the results in our team's ability to continue to execute and in our strategy that's continuing to drive results here. Doug McMillon : So I mean, I think I'll be a bit repetitive with our previous conversations, but if you look back over the last few years, you'll remember that we've made price investments, we've made wage investments, and for a while we've been telling you that we think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to that. We use the term managing our price gaps deliberately, because that's how we think about it. And if we do need to make further price investments to drive growth or to ensure those baskets are in good shape, we can do that. Investing in our associates is always part of our plan. So I think you guys can expect that we'll continue to do it. What's happening with business mix in this quarter in particular with inventory management puts us in a position where we do have even more flexibility to make a variety of choices. And so we're doing that every week and every month as we manage our business through the quarter and through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohms with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Robbie Ohms : Oh, hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my one question. My question is that during the commentary, Doug and John David, you guys talked about deflation in both general merchandise and food and consumables? And then you talked about rollbacks in April being up 45%. And then you also talked about gross margin strength in the Walmart U.S. business. Can you help us think about that going forward? Should we -- are you, and how are you doing that? Is it really just the advertising, digital advertising and marketplace fulfillment and all those things are helping the gross margin so much that it's more than offsetting gross margin, you know, core gross margin weakness? You know, maybe help us think about how to think about that going forward. Doug McMillon : Yes, Robbie, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to gross margin, we're having a conversation inside the company about the fact that the composition of it's changing and we don't want to confuse people about what's happening. We are built, our purpose is, to help people save money and live better. And we'll manage our merchandise margins like we always have and make sure that we're providing value. But as we report gross margin, it does reflect newer businesses that are helping us mix things up. And so we're using terms inside the company like our merchandise or product margins as distinguished from gross margins. So maybe, John David, as we think about our future reporting, we should help kind of clarify that a bit so that people don't have the wrong perception that gross margins are going up as a result of price. They're not. If you look at rollbacks, for example, as John mentioned in the U.S. and as we mentioned earlier this morning, we're seeing a lot of rollbacks. Suppliers participate in a majority of those, but not all of them. We're going to lead on price and we're going to manage our margins and we're going to be the Walmart that we've always been. But it's also great news that the business mix is changing, which just does change gross margin performance. John David Rainey : Yes. Robbie, there's maybe three points that I'd make in response to your question. The first is that overall inflation level for the business was up about 40 basis points for the quarter, that's half the rate of increase that we saw last year. So we're driving this revenue growth through more units, more foot traffic in stores and feel really good about that and that underscores that we\u2019re just becoming more relevant with consumers. So that's the first point. Second point around gross margins is, we've mentioned several times that inventory is in a much better place. One of the consequences or results of that is we see a lot less markdowns in our business. And so that drove some of the improvement in the first quarter. The third point, and the one that I'd want to emphasize the most here, if you look at the composition of our operating income improvement year-over-year, roughly $900 million, about a third of that came from our newer businesses like advertising, membership, data ventures, and we're quite excited about that. But combined with that, we're seeing improved e-commerce losses. And one of the things that I focus a lot on in our business is what is the incremental profit from that additional revenue that we have each year? So incremental margins. And if you just focused on our e-commerce business, in this last quarter, the incremental margins around that business were 12.5%. So think about that, roughly 3 times our overall margin. There's not to me a more compelling data point that supports the strategy that we have and our execution around that and importantly how that's changing the margin profile of our business going forward. Robbie Ohms : That sounds great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As hard as it is to mention, how would you break down the factors that are driving Walmart's business that are related to its actions and strategies versus those factors that are more of a function of the environment, such as high inflation and a moderating labor market? What two or three metrics is Walmart monitoring to internally gauge this? Obviously, the point of the question is trying to understand not only the sustainability of the performance, if the macro does get better, but also the prospect that the outperformance could expand if the environment weakens? Thank you so much. Doug McMillon : Michael, I probably ignore the external environment more than you do. I mean, we are focused on what we're doing and how we earn business with customers and members. And if you look at what's happened, we've been known for price forever, but we're increasing known for convenience. So whether the environment is inflationary or deflationary, whether customers have more money or less money, if we're doing a good job on the items and prices and the service we provide, saving them money with pickup and delivery, for example, we can continue to grow share. So we're merchants at the core and we've added through the technological changes that we've made and the service changes that we've made, a dimension of the business that's driving that growth. I don't know what the future looks like in terms of what pricing is going to look like, you know, a year out, two years out. And I don't really worry about that very much. I worry about our own execution. John David Rainey : Not much to add there. But I think the results this quarter are really a reflection of execution across the team. We're laser focused on the things that matter most to our customers. And one data point that I'd share just in the U.S. business, and John might want to chime in on this, but you know, Michael, that we grade ourselves by a perfect order. And what a perfect order is for us is when you come to our virtual store online, do you find the things that you want? Do we have to replace those? Is it delivered when we say it will be delivered? Year-over-year in the first quarter, we saw an almost 900 basis point improvement in our perfect order scores. To me that's a great example of how the team is continuing to execute and this is resonating with customers. John Furner : Hey Michael, good morning, it's John. I'd say what something similar to what Doug said, we're always focused on value and over the last few years we've been talking about flexibility and the ability to be convenient, whether a customer wants to shop at the counter, at the curb, or delivery. And it's been exciting to see just these last few months that delivery is now exceeding the other channels, which is great which gives the customer a lot of optionality and then the number that Doug mentioned earlier 4.4 billion units delivered same day next day is exciting and it's growing quickly and as he also mentioned about 20% of that is sub-three hours and we've expanded that service earlier in the morning, later at night so we're becoming even more convenient for individuals for shoppers and families in a -- in terms of being able to serve all of their needs. Doug McMillon : Those underlying input metrics were focused on around the world in our Sams U.S. Business Center International and the commonality between the strategies, first party e-commerce marketplace, advertising membership causes us to increasingly be thinking about the same thing as we build these new businesses. Kath McLay : Yes, I mean, I would just add in like, you know, you look in Chile is probably our market that's had the least amount of growth, the economy has been tough there. As we focused on import metrics like NPS in stock, our price perception, price gap market share. If you focus on those things, when the economy starts to recover, the business lives with it. While we're doing that, you're also getting in and making sure that you're building out more sustainable businesses around e-commerce. So over 60% of our e-commerce orders are same day in Chile now. So I think we have shown that we can prosper and thrive in kind of multiple different versions of how the economy plays out across the world. And I think during this time, as we're focused on building out our e-commerce omni business, we're being more and more relevant to consumers in different markets. Chris Nicholas : I think for Sam's Club, it's very similar. We've got a really balanced set of results in Sam's Club. And, you know, as John mentioned, you know, it's all in the hands of the associates and the hard work that they did. But the value proposition is really resonating with the club model. It's great items at great value and we'll just never relent on that. And members are thanking us for it. So plus membership, membership is an all-time high plus membership is at 54% of our member base right now. And it's up 330 basis points in the year. Why because we're focusing on the things that really matter deepening digital engagement with our members 18% e-commerce growth and a third of our members are using Scan and Go now, which is really exciting. We're enhancing our member value proposition constantly. Price is part of it, but value is an important component too. I think you've all heard that we've got 120 of our stores, our clubs today, that have got the news exit technology that's powered by AI and computer vision. That's really exciting. And then Member\u2019s Mark, which is our own brand, is really setting the bar for quality as well as value. It's now over a third of our sales and we are seeing really strong participation in the quarter. So people just want really great items at really great value and we just continue to give them that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed see with your question. Krisztina Katai : Hi, good morning and congrats on a great quarter. So Kath, I wanted to ask you on international opportunities in particular. The performance was really strong. I think you put up your best operating margin over six years. So can you talk about sort of the main drivers behind the improvement just how you're thinking about international EBIT structure on a go forward basis as you have alternative value streams that are ramping e-commerce contribution is improving, all regions are posting very strong top line growth? And I just wanted to ask if there's anything you can share regarding Flipkart\u2019s contribution, how has that changed relative to the acquisition as we've been reading reports that at one point you're ramping up for an IPO? Thank you. Kath McLay : Yes, thanks for the question. And there's quite a few components to that. I'll try and take them in chunks. First of all, I want to recognize all of our associates in international for the extraordinarily strong result that we've been able to deliver over the last period. You're right, it is a really strong result. Top line was up 10.7%, bottom line or op inc was up 27%. Now I would like to call out that, that's not -- that's kind of extraordinary. There were some one-offs that went into Q1 op inc, which aren't repeatable, but we are holding to the ratio of bottom line growing faster than top line. So we see strength in international, particularly in the way that we are turning up as kind of more of an ecosystem. So if you look in Walmex, while we have grown the traditional business, we've been looking at how we make sure we're relevant to consumers in areas like where we had consumers that couldn't engage with us online, we've been able to provide a service that enables them to get digital connectivity. And what that means is that we now have different revenue streams coming in. I think we have over 13 million customers have engaged with us on BiTE, which is our digital connectivity. We've sold a number of health memberships. So the composition of that business as well as having our Kashi Financial Services looks different, and that's helping drive the different kind of economics and more richer op inc. As we look at then at eCom across the globe, I'd probably call out China. I know I've called out the China market before, but really strong growth in Sam's Club. And that business is almost 50-50 offline and online. And while we're doing that, I think this quarter, our bottom line grew faster than our top line in Sam's Club. So really good strength, because they've worked out a model of dark stores that give them access to a larger addressable area of the market and allow them to deliver really, really efficiently. So our eCom omni business is growing in a sustainable way. And then as you talk about Flipkart, I think the things that we've seen with Flipkart that we really like is as their business has grown, we've seen -- get to EBITDA positive for the last 2 quarters. We've seen a growth in some premiumization, and all of that is lifting kind of the profile of the Flipkart business. And so we're -- they're on track to the growth trajectory that we had them on. And we are looking and exploring when will be the right time to IPO that business. But now there's strong both in Flipkart and in PhonePe, and we're excited about the India market. Krisztina Katai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen : Hi, thank you. Within general merchandise, what categories are you most excited about? What do you see happening with innovation opportunities and/or opportunities for improvement? And as we think about general merchandise as well, the intersection of artificial intelligence, large language models and also really changing the way consumers think about shopping, just what's on your mind for enhancing that and embracing the marketplace as you've been doing to continue to elevate the brand? Thank you. John David Rainey : General merchandise is a really core part of all of our businesses, and it's something in Sam's Club that we're really excited about. We have brands that are extreme value, and we feel really good about that. And we've got Member's Mark, where we have incredible value and quality. And what we're seeing is that members are opting into us, as a brand, and renewing membership with us because we offer such high quality at such high value. So what we're seeing is that people are continuing to opt in to us. Our units are running ahead of our sales on general merchandise because of the value. So we feel really bullish. You think about apparel, jewelry, home, hardlines, auto, consumer electronics, we're seeing really strong unit growth in there. And it's just being followed -- it's because of value and it's because of innovation. So we remain really bullish in that space. John Furner : Oliver, it's John. I'd like to talk about a couple of things in GM. And I think I'd first start with eCommerce. The strong performance at 22% growth is very helpful. We've picked up momentum in the marketplace. Really, really pleased to see a number -- a really large number of new sellers come on board, and assortment's well north of $400 million. We spent a lot of time talking about our customer experience score, which starts with the top of the funnel, and then we work our way all the way down the conversion. And as John David mentioned earlier, one of the components is perfect order. And as you look through results, it's exciting to see more customers shopping more often, particularly in the marketplace. And then the categories that are really strong that are standing out is apparel and fashion online. I'm really excited about what's happening in men's and women's and kids apparel, we've seen growth there. And then our hardlines business has been strong over the quarter. It was helpful in the quarter to have Easter early and strong weather in March that give us a strong early start. And these businesses we call omni services like tire installation, as we mentioned earlier, having your prescription ready by ordering online or cake decorating, these are all great services that are relatively unique to Walmart to be able to enable those from a digital standpoint all the way through the store and then deliver to people's home. So I really am excited about the convenience and the expansion and assortment that we're offering. Doug McMillon : Oliver, we punched below our weight on general merchandise, specifically in apparel and home for a really long time, maybe forever. And I think the progress that we're seeing now is driven by the in-store remodels and in eCommerce. The marketplace is a great opportunity, but 1P will be important, too. So we've now got tools that we can use to grow the general merchandise business that we didn't have before. As it relates the other part of the question, I think the thing worth mentioning is the progress we're seeing on search. I'm really excited about a solution-oriented search and this migration that many of us are on to try and create a personal assistant so that we can be more anticipatory, save people more time and help them with solutions more than what our previous search capability could do. So I think that's going to be on a maturity curve from now until the end of time, and generative AI has helped us step change that, and I expect that, that improvement will continue. Oliver Chen : Thank you. Best regards. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Seth Sigman : Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus on operating expenses and thinking about the investments planned for this year. If I recall, there was a first half weighting in the guidance originally. I know some of that was a year-over-year dynamic. Any update on how to think about that? And more specific to the second quarter, it looks like you set up guidance very similar to how you set up Q1. I'm just curious, is there anything different about the opportunity in Q2? In other words, could there be a bigger step-up in spending? Or anything else that may limit the flow-through that we were able to see here? Thanks. John David Rainey : Sure, Seth. Happy to take the question. This is John David. So when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, in last quarter's call, we talked about the first-half of the year, we'd likely see that sales would outpace operating income. Maybe that's unlikely now with this results in the first quarter, but we did have some planned investment in the second quarter related to some technology investments. We've also got a little higher depreciation year-over-year. In terms of the opportunity in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, there are a couple of things I want to call out in the first quarter that likely would not repeat themselves, but I don't want to take away from the team's strong performance. The first of those is just strong seasonal events in the first -- in international that helped us. And we also lapped a LIFO charge last year at Sam's, which contributed to some of the operating income growth. Those are likely not to repeat themselves, but -- so the possibility for outperformance in 2Q may be less than what it was in the first quarter. That said, I don't want to take away the headline here, and we feel really good about how the team is operating. We feel really good about what the year holds for us and the opportunity to outperform the guidance that we've given. Seth Sigman : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to just go back to business mix. I guess, with the continued strong growth in marketplace, I guess want to -- when you look at the performance of general merchandise and Walmart U.S., that market sales would obviously skew higher towards those discretionary categories -- the 420 million SKUs there? So I guess the question is, is the impact of 3P marketplace growth at all starting to cannibalize maybe in a good way, the general merchandise comps that you provide? And -- or would the performance of general merchandise be stronger if you looked at it more holistically from a total GMV standpoint? John David Rainey : Let me start on this and others may want to jump in. So first of all, as you think about the mix of our business, we've continued to have a headwind as consumer wallets have been stretched. And for us, that's resulted in about a 100 basis point shift away from general merchandise to other categories of our business in the first quarter. We expect that to continue or some magnitude of that for the balance of the year. But to me, the real story here around general merchandise, is the progress that we're making in our marketplace. And so while general merchandise is, call it, roughly flat, there are categories like pets and beauty, where the growth in the marketplace is in excess of 30%, There are other categories like furniture, sporting goods that are in excess of 20%. And I think this shows that consumers -- customers are coming to us, thinking of us very differently than what they have in the past. And it's also an indication of how and where we're gaining share in our business. So general merchandise being able to offer third-party assortment is giving our customers a lot more options than what they've had in the past. Doug McMillon : I think general merchandise mix was impacted by food inflation to a degree. When food shot up to mid-double digits, there are a lot of customers that had their paycheck allocated that direction. And now that food pricing has calmed down some and we've got rollbacks happening in food and you've got a deflationary situation with GM, you've got the opportunity given the elasticity to grow more units, which we're doing. And the fact that we're growing share feels good. So I don't get too caught up, Kelly, on whether the sales come through stores, clubs, first party or marketplace. We just want to have what people are looking for. And we'll manage the mix on the other end of it in a way that generates more profitability, which is what you're seeing in this quarter. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thank you, guys. You mentioned that within Walmart U.S. that the share gains were led by the higher income households, I believe. Curious how you define that. What percent of your customer base the higher income households comprised? And how are you targeting that consumer? And also curious, how is that consumer's engagement, with Walmart changed? Thanks. John David Rainey : Yes, this is John David. I'll start. So we define where we stratify the income groups roughly as $50,000 and below, $50,000 to $100,000 and then $100,000 and above. And as a general rule, our customer base breaks down about one-third in each group. And so in terms of what we're doing to be more attractive to that higher income household, I think this is the -- really the story or the word we've been using here is convenience. We are not just a play for value anymore. We talked about the number of units that we've shipped in the last 12-months, which is on par with any eCommerce player in the world. That shows that customers are coming to us and we're a consideration where we had been before. And convenience matters to someone irrespective of what your payback is, irrespective of what your income level is. And we expect that to be durable. We don't expect that to change. John Furner : Yes, John David, I'd just add to that, it's also been encouraging to see the improvements in fresh food. We've definitely experienced benefit from improvements in quality. The supply chain's gotten tighter. Many of you have seen the work we're doing in supply chain. But produce has been really exciting to see the progress over the last couple of years. The same sort of quality improvements are coming through in the meat department. And you can see that in the types of items and categories that we're selling in store and those and pickup and delivery. And in the delivery business where we are stronger with higher income consumer, that's where we've seen a lot of growth. I'm really excited, Doug, what you mentioned earlier is Better Goods as being a way to sell better quality, better taste profiles and at values that really matter. 70% of the items under $5 is exciting, and that appeals to all income groups. And so if you're trying to feed a family of four or five or six, and prices and restaurants have gone up and Walmart is beginning to come down, and we're really proud of the rollbacks, I think our value message is strong and having the ability to deliver flexibly is going to work out really well for us. Doug McMillon : We're not trying to chase higher income cohort sales. We just offer value. If you look at what's happened historically, people with higher incomes have shopped Walmart. They've just been selective in their -- in the categories that they buy and the items that they buy. So if we offer them the right items at the right prices, whether that's in store, first party or marketplace, they'll respond to that. And so as we've been able to expand our assortment online, we can appeal to more people. And then you layer on the convenience dimension and you get a good outcome. Paul Lejuez : Thank you, gents. Good luck. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Pleased proceed with your question. Chuck Grom : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a really great quarter. Just wondering if you can discuss trends you're seeing within general merchandise between smaller ticket, shorter replacement item versus higher ticket, longer replacement items. And if any in spending within the categories reflect anything about whether the consumer is making any incremental changes in their discretionary spending? And then just as a quick follow-up, just curious if there was any deviation or big change in trend throughout the quarter by month? Thank you. John Furner : Yes, Chuck. It's John. I'll take it. I think the best way to describe the consumers, it's been remarkably consistent over the last couple of years. Mix has changed, but hasn't changed that much. We've seen growth in both brands and private brands. We have seen a wide range of price point selling in the quarter. March was a strong month, given Easter was in the month. We had leap here in February. That was also helped to make it stronger. So the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that surprising. It was strong in February, strong again in March, weather was favorable March, a little bit colder and then April was softer without Easter in it. But we walked out of the quarter into the month of May with similar trends that we've been seeing. So the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that different than we expected. I think as you look forward, the consumer's consistent, our inventory is in good shape. Our merchants -- we said this a few minutes ago, they have the ability to mix out. They're managing their price gaps and value. They're managing initial margins. Their markdowns have been lower due to stronger inventory management. A little bit of improvement this year in shrinkage from private -- from the previous years. We've been going up for the last three years, and it's good to see that starting to come down in some places in the country. But we'll mix this out. Our merchant team, they've done this for a while. And in any situation with the consumer, we want to focus on value and be there for them, and we'll manage the mix on the back side. Chuck Grom : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Also congrats on a nice quarter. So just going back to the commentary on Walmart Plus. It sounds like it's growing double digits. As we look at the backdrop out there for membership and subscriptions, you're clearly seeing a more crowded landscape. So just want to get a sense of how you guys feel about the value proposition today and then further opportunities -- different plus going forward? John Furner : Rupesh, it's John. I'm pleased with the progress in Walmart Plus. It is an important part of what we do, and it is a great way for customers to save time and save money. By joining Walmart Plus, you get access to unlimited deliveries, which is great. And I talked to a lot of people over the country that use it all the time. It's also been important for us to improve the perfect order. As we mentioned earlier, we launched Walmart Plus in 2020 at a time the supply chain was difficult. And so the continued momentum and improvements and being able to fulfill customers' orders with what they ordered when they order has been important. But again, it's an important part of what we do. We think it's a great solution for customers, and it's been exciting to see the progress. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Thanks. I'd like to pivot a bit back to the top line. And I think you said inflation was 40 bps in the quarter. If you look at your guidance for the rest of the year, do you expect it to settle at that kind of low level or even fall further? John David Rainey : Greg, we expect it to be relatively close to what we saw in the current quarter. It's a mix across the baskets. We've seen general merchandise be more deflationary, but consumables and food are hovering slightly above flat to up one. So we generally expect it to be in this level. Greg Melich : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the call over to Douglas McMillon for closing remarks. Doug McMillon : Thank you all for joining the call. Again, thanks to our associates for a really strong quarter. When I think about the headlines from the quarter, what goes through my mind is, first, the eCommerce growth. I think the progress we're making on convenience for customers is a big deal, and that's happening through. Our store fulfillment as well as through fulfillment centers, the marketplace is growing, and that brings along with it growth in advertising and membership. It was great to see both of those up 24%. Second headline's related to really good inventory management. And the third headline's related to pricing. I think the number of rollbacks that we have and the value that we're offering to customers and members is resonating and those really set this quarter apart. Big picture our thought is the same as it has been. We're going to be able to grow sales because we're positioned to serve people how they want to be served, we're going to grow profit faster than sales because of business mix and we're going to be able to grow returns as we make the right capital investments. So we'll be really consistent as it relates to that through the year, and we appreciate your time and attention. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
